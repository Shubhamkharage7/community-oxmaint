I am employed at a facility equipped with numerous Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) in various applications, mainly within web handling and extruder machinery. The predominant VFD brands used are Allen Bradley (1336 and PF755) and Parker/SSD (690+ and 890), with power outputs ranging from 2HP to 500HP, mostly falling within the 5-20HP range. \n\nThe majority of VFDs operate in a closed-loop system, utilizing either a load cell or pressure transducer for feedback. In our setup, feedback instruments are typically directly connected to the drive, with the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) supplying speed references. An encoder is commonly installed on each drive, however, we have encountered challenges with this configuration. Issues include reliance on outdated drive hardware, software compatibility constraints, and complexities in troubleshooting due to dual control components.\n\nTo address these issues, we have transitioned to using Allen Bradley PF755 drives controlled entirely via Ethernet/IP by the PLC. This setup simplifies future upgrades and maintenance, consolidates control within the PLC for easier management of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) loops, and does not appear to impact process performance negatively compared to direct feedback wiring to the drive.\n\nNow, the question arises - do we still require the encoders in this setup? What benefits do they provide, considering the fast PLC scan times and Ethernet/IP communication capabilities? Furthermore, how does speed control improve in drives with fixed setpoints when utilizing a fixed/open-loop control method?

I have two inquiries: 1) what could have caused the EPAC to short circuit while leaving the other components unharmed, and 2) why did we need to include the PFD when replacing the EPAC with the EP24? Both the EPAC (which converts voltage from 110V to 5V) and the EP24 (which converts voltage from 24V to 5V) ultimately output a 5V signal to the backplane, so why was the PFD necessary? Could we have simply swapped the EPAC for the EP24 directly since they both convert voltage to 5V?

Without performance standards and operating context, a functional statement lacks accuracy. By establishing performance standards within the FS, a functional failure can be identified. For example, if a pump is designed to pump 600 gpm of water but the desired performance is 500 gpm, the pump technically fails (Functional Failure) at 499 gpm according to the performance standards.

This software must be installed on the same PC as the Interface Board, also known as the RTAB in ABB MOD terms. The RTAB emulates a Multibus1 system on a PCI board to allow data retrieval over the MOD300 DCN in a masterless token ring topology.\n\nAs you can tell, upgrade options for the PC and its operating system are limited, currently stuck on Windows XP. Despite attempts to run it on Windows 7, it was unsuccessful. I have incorporated some Matrikon Middle Ware (their OPC-ODBC Client) to extract real-time data from the ABB MOD system and store it in a SQL Database. Everything has been running smoothly, although challenges have arisen as SQL is continuously updated.\n\nHowever, a new obstacle has emerged as the customer's Corporate IT department mandates the use of Windows Server 2019 with SQL Server 2019, rendering the old SQL Drivers on Windows XP unusable due to the requirement of TLS 1.2. Previous compatibility with TLS 1.0 has been disrupted by this change. Despite my efforts to resolve this issue with Corporate IT, including exploring patches and workarounds, the solutions provided by Microsoft have not been effective.\n\nThe client is transitioning to Inductive Automation's Ignition system on multiple machines, moving away from the ABB Advant/MOD300 platform to ControlLogix/Ignition setup. However, two machines with specialized equipment cannot be migrated immediately, prompting me to consider integrating visualization and data archiving into Ignition for basic functionalities. This would entail establishing communication with the ABB MOD300 OPC Server and potentially archiving data to SQL within Ignition.\n\nNevertheless, my attempts to connect OPC Clients like Kepware, Matrikon, and OPC-Expert to the MOD300 server located on another machine have been unsuccessful so far. Adjusting DCOM settings in the software has not yielded the desired results. The complexity is further compounded by the customer's deployment of Ignition Servers on Linux for running multiple machines, necessitating caution to prevent any disruptions.\n\nI am seeking advice from anyone who has successfully accessed data remotely from the ABB MOD300 OPC Server.

I am currently working on a project that involves utilizing an Allen-Bradley 1769-L30ER v31 along with a Panelview Plus7 v11. One of the key features of this project is an AOI that monitors the operational time of equipment and sends a notification when a specific maintenance interval is reached. To accommodate changes in equipment, I am looking to empower the plant manager to customize the names of these preset maintenance intervals directly on the HMI interface. For instance, they could rename \"Grease Bearings\" to \"Change Gearbox Oil.\" My concern is whether this customization process is feasible or if it will pose more challenges than benefits. Alternatively, I could assign generic names like \"TMR Scheduled Maintenance 1 and 2,\" but that may require the manager to maintain a separate legend or schedule.

I aim to implement a system with two PLCs (primary and redundant) running the same program. In case the primary PLC fails, the redundant PLC will take over. I plan to utilize Modbus RTU (specifically Carel Modbus RTU) as the communication protocol, with the Carel cPCO Mini as the controller. Each controller boasts two Modbus ports.\n\nGiven that Modbus is a single master protocol, my idea is to use the first Modbus port to establish a connection between the primary and redundant controllers to monitor the primary's status. The primary controller will function as the master on the second Modbus port, connecting to all sensors and devices. Similarly, the redundant controller will also act as a master on its secondary Modbus port, which will be inactive as long as the heartbeat signal between the controllers on the first Modbus port is consistent. In the event of a heartbeat error, the primary PLC's Modbus port 2 would be disabled, and the redundant PLC's Modbus port 2 would be activated. This setup would ensure redundancy with only one active master communicating with the sensors and devices at any given time.\n\nWill this approach be effective? Are there any crucial details I may have overlooked? While I have experience with Ethernet IP over the past four years, my knowledge of Modbus is more limited.\n\nBest regards,\nWirelessliquid","replies_count":2,"page_name":"setting-up-redundant-plcs-with-modbus-rtu-for-system-backup","post_date":"12-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Simatic SM374 (374-sxh01-0aa0) Module Addressing Challenges in TIA Portal v.18","user_name":"ceilingwalker","content":"Hello everyone!

I initially connected the U+ wire from the sensor to IN1 on the PLC and the U- wire to ground, but it did not yield results. Would I require additional signal conditioning, such as the Phoenix Contact MCR-SL-U-I-UI-SL, to convert the 4-20 mA signal from the sensor to a 0-10V signal? It is important to note that the analog input of the MIO module is designed to measure voltage (0-10V) and does not support current directly. Any detailed instructions on the correct wiring and configuration procedures would be greatly appreciated. For reference, here is the datasheet for the Digital & Analog Input module I am using: [insert link] and here is the datasheet for the WIKA A-10 sensor: [insert link].

Unfortunately, it doesn't fully address the concerns raised by our IT and cybersecurity auditor. I have elaborated on the questions based on the information provided in the aforementioned thread:\n\nIf an unauthorized individual manages to breach our firewall, gain access to one of our Programming VMs running the necessary Rockwell software for editing our Safety PLC (L81ES), obtains validation from the Rockwell license server, logs into the safety PLC, and maliciously alters the safety part of the controller code:\n- Will the PLC need to enter program mode for the logic changes to take effect?\n- If modifications are made to the safety program(s) without generating a new safety signature, what will happen when the PLC is power cycled? Will it continue running the 'old' code, switch to the 'new' code, or remain idle due to the absence of a safety signature?\n\nAlthough I have reviewed various manuals, this level of detail seems to exceed their coverage. It may also be too specialized for YouTube tutorials, as they primarily focus on initial safety program setup rather than editing procedures. Unfortunately, I am unable to conduct test trials myself as we only have one safety controller on-site, and our spare is currently being used for remote development by a contractor.","replies_count":10,"page_name":"understanding-the-impact-of-cyber-breach-on-safety-plc-program-modifications","post_date":"21-06-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Benefits of implementing reliability modeling for process plant expansion versus entire plant: A comprehensive guide","user_name":"Juha-Pekka Kekki","content":"Greetings!

However, there are important considerations to take into account when opting to 'replace'. For example, choosing to 'replace' means performing a preventive maintenance action despite the item still having some useful life remaining. Additionally, valuable materials can be salvaged from the discarded part, but this process incurs energy and processing costs. On the other hand, 'repair' often requires greater skill than 'replace', and these skills may diminish over time if 'replace' becomes the preferred choice. The traditional economic model fails to consider these factors, focusing solely on measurable and opportunity costs. Nevertheless, opting to 'replace' can stimulate the economy, maintain job security, and promote overall satisfaction.

The Result Array of the FBC stores the memory locations of true bits from the source array, leading to a potential risk of overflowing if all bits are true. This means that the Result array must be significantly larger than the source array - for instance, a 100 DINT source array would require a 3200 DINT result array to prevent overflow and potential PLC faults.

I thought I had everything figured out, but it turns out it wouldn't work. Here is the situation I'm dealing with: I am using a 1769-L30ER flow meter with pulse output (100:1 ratio) for a batching process. Thanks to some valuable information on this website, I was able to construct this process successfully. However, for a small program I created, I am now focusing on utilizing SFC or SQI SQO.\n\nMy objective is simply to mix two ingredients, meeting a preset requirement. While accuracy is not crucial, I am aiming to monitor pulses. The meter will count pulses and once it reaches the desired amount, it will close the valve and make a batch correction to avoid overshooting by \"X\" gallons on the first run. I want the PLC to automatically adjust this for each new batch.\n\nInitially, I calculated that 100 gallons would require 10,000 pulses (based on the V/V% of calculated amounts per ingredient). I determined the formula as follows: (TargetPulses - TargetOS) = TargetConfirmed (the target at which the valve should close in advance). When the stored pulse count reaches the target, the valve will close. Given that the valve takes about 3 seconds to close, I set a timer for 5 seconds.\n\nTo account for any overshoot, I subtracted the PulseCount from the TargetPulses. Then, I transferred that result to TargetOS. Ideally, if the result was zero, the system would correct itself for each batch. For example, if 1000 pulses were counted and the target was also 1000 pulses, the overshoot would be zero. This would signal a restart of the cycle, ensuring accuracy for subsequent batches.\n\nI am wondering if there is anything essential that I may be overlooking in my setup. I have searched for batch controller code or examples, but it seems that most rely on a PID loop with a control valve.","replies_count":24,"page_name":"improving-batch-accuracy-with-on-off-valve-control","post_date":"29-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Siemens LOGO for Home and Industrial Automation: Feedback and Mobile App Functionality","user_name":"Sham","content":"Hello everyone, I would like to gather feedback on the use of Siemens LOGO for home automation or industrial automation purposes.

The problem was traced back to the setup involving a Stratix 2000, Stratix 5400, and Stratix 5700 switches. The RIO 2 and I/O Link were originally connected to the Stratix 2000, which was then connected to the unconfigured Stratix 5400, and finally to the configured Stratix 5700.\n\nTo resolve the dropping connection problem, I bypassed the Stratix 2000 and directly connected the RIO and I/O Link to the Stratix 5400. I then configured the Stratix 5400 by setting all smartport settings to automation device, except for the port connected to the Stratix 5700 which was set as Switch for Automation.\n\nUpon checking the smartport configuration of the Stratix 5700, I noticed that everything was set to automation device except for the ports connected to the Stratix 5400 and our network switch. When I connected directly to the LAN, the connection dropout issue disappeared, but I was unable to see beyond the Stratix 5400 from my company network after the configuration changes.\n\nI suspect that the VLAN ID settings may be causing the issue as currently, both switches are set to VLAN1. As I am not an expert in networking, I am unsure about which configuration settings to adjust. I have been consulting resources but have not made much progress yet.

This means that you cannot connect these safety outputs directly to STO without having something else in parallel to serve as a load. Rockwell Automation's official solution is to use a 2.4k resistor. This issue likely extends to the 1756-OBV8S and the new Flex 5000 safety outputs, with the exception of the safety relay outputs.

Secondary functions, although seemingly trivial, can pose significant threats to an organization if overlooked. Therefore, when establishing maintenance effectiveness measures and targets, every function must be taken into account.\n\nOn page 304, the book discusses how OEE only pertains to the primary function of an asset, neglecting the fact that assets, including machine tools, have multiple functions each with their own performance standards. This means that OEE does not provide a comprehensive view of overall effectiveness, focusing only on the primary function being fulfilled.\n\nAs a practitioner of TPM for over a decade, I disagree with the idea that OEE is the primary measure of TPM. TPM activities ensure that both primary and secondary functions are addressed through pillars like Autonomous Maintenance and Planned Maintenance. By addressing secondary functions, TPM aims to achieve its OEE goal by reducing function loss and function reduction loss.\n\nIn conclusion, while TPM has its own terminology for primary and secondary functions, the focus remains on optimizing equipment functions to achieve maximum effectiveness.","replies_count":24,"page_name":"optimizing-equipment-functions-for-maximum-effectiveness-insights-from-moubray","post_date":"09-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Connect Two PCs to Control One PLC via MX OPC and Kepserver","user_name":"duy dt","content":"I am encountering difficulties in connecting two PCs to control a PLC simultaneously using MX OPC and Kepserver.

While SEL Tech support engineers have advised against this, they have not provided a clear explanation as to why this is not recommended. They have pointed out that none of their customers have attempted to use the EtherCAT network POU in the same way I am trying to. \n\nHere is a breakdown of my setup: \n1. I have two RTACs, referred to as RTAC A and RTAC B. \n2. RTAC A is configured with an IPAlias block communicating with a corresponding IPAlias block on RTAC B. \n3. The IPAlias block determines which RTAC will take control of the IPAlias interface (x.x.x.x). \n4. I have an Axion RemoteIO chassis that utilizes EtherCAT as the protocol. \n5. Each RTAC has an EtherCAT network with a software POU block that can be enabled or disabled. \n\nMy goal is to use the output of the IPAlias block to control the activation/deactivation of the EtherCAT POU on the RTAC, ensuring that only the RTAC in charge has control over the Axion Remote IO running on the EtherCAT protocol. \n\nDespite attempting the setup, it has not been successful. I am now seeking documentation on the sequence of operations for EtherCAT. I have tried searching for this information online, but only come across articles discussing the benefits of EtherCAT without finding specific technical details. \n\nFrom my understanding, the EtherCAT network is initialized once during the download to the RTAC and does not have a mechanism to re-initialize if the Master disconnects. I am unable to find documentation outlining the actions in case of a Master disconnect or when the network service is stopped by the EtherCAT POU. \n\nI am reaching out to those with extensive experience in working with EtherCAT. Is it technically feasible to implement fail-over for a Master on the EtherCAT network? Does the EtherCAT network instance retain certain parameters of the Master, such as IP or MAC addresses, in a way that could cause issues if another Master were to take over the network? \n\nAny insights or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

With Rockwell Automation hardware, I have mainly worked on simple assembly benches and CIP servo motion projects. I am currently assisting a small company in gaining more experience in this area, as well as enhancing my own skills.\n\nThe project at hand involves spinning a part at 150rpm using a servo and encoder, and counting teeth on the part using a 5v crankshaft position sensor. The sensor detects 58 teeth (60 with 2 missing for a register position) by capturing rising and falling edges, resulting in a square waveform on an oscilloscope. The goal is to graphically plot or log voltage spikes of the teeth against servo rotational position, analyze the data to determine peak to peak measurements and extrapolate degrees of rotation between teeth.\n\nThe recommended servo/encoder for this project is a Kollmorgen absolute hiperface encoder. It is essential to accurately capture the register position of missing teeth and log voltage spikes against rotational position. Quality assessments will be made based on the spacing of the teeth, with bent teeth resulting in part rejection. The data acquisition process should be completed within one rotation of the part (0.4 seconds at 150rpm), including the identification of missing teeth during random loading.\n\nI have looked into National Instruments (NI) as an alternative, but integrating the hiperface encoder appears to be complex. Consideration is being given to using a simple incremental encoder instead. Options from a company called Promess, such as the UltraPro product, could meet the project requirements but are expensive. There is also interest in Kistler KiBox and Beckhoff solutions, although the latter may require additional knowledge in programming and software requirements. Beckhoff's compatibility with EtherCat, a communication protocol used by Kollmorgen, makes it a potential choice, although further research is needed.\n\nAny guidance or recommendations on suitable control systems for this project would be greatly valued.","replies_count":6,"page_name":"choosing-the-best-control-system-for-spinning-part-accuracy","post_date":"11-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Incorporating Piping Loops in SAP PM: Object Links vs. Equipment Master - Which is Better?","user_name":"joshua suring","content":"Are you incorporating piping loops based on the RBI study into your SAP PM system?

I have some experience in programming PLCs, so I am seeking a conceptual explanation rather than a specific hardware solution. In our work with machine overhauls, we are currently working on a square canister-bottle labeler. The labeler assembly is positioned next to a conveyor that brings spaced canisters, and it is meant to apply labels to the flat side of each canister as they pass by. Since the electrical components are not functioning properly, we are incorporating a new PLC into the system.\n\nThe new PLC includes a label gap sensor that can be adjusted along the label web to control how much label protrudes from the peel-plate. Additionally, there is a small display where adjustments can be made to the '0' offset and label length. I believe the offset adjustment on the display is designed to simplify changes, particularly when switching to a different label. As for entering the label length, my main confusion lies in why this step is necessary. Could the motor simply be run from the sensor (gap) plus offset to the sensor (gap) plus offset without losing position? It seems that this method would consistently overshoot by the same amount each time.\n\nRunning the motor for a set length may allow for a slow-down ramp, but it could also result in position loss over time. In this case, automatic correction would need to be implemented by referencing the gap sensor. My line of thinking involves continuously monitoring the gap sensor while running the motor, and making adjustments for any deviations from the ideal position. Does this approach align with the best way to address the issue?","replies_count":22,"page_name":"understanding-the-operational-logic-of-labeler-machines","post_date":"08-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Add a Search Filter to an HMI Dropdown List for Easy Part Navigation","user_name":"ar21096","content":"Hello, I am currently working on designing an HMI using Sysmac Studio for automating the production of parts based on their specifications.

Here is an overview of the situation at hand: \n\nSystem Overview:\n- Reactive Power Setpoint: The setpoint is received from the grid operator.\n- Inverters: Each inverter has a specified capacity and can utilize up to 60% of this capacity for reactive power. The number of operational inverters can vary.\n- VAR Generator: With a higher capacity, the VAR Generator is designed to handle any excess reactive power that surpasses the inverters' capabilities.\n\nObjective:\nThe main goal is to allocate the reactive power setpoint between the inverters and the VAR Generator in a manner that ensures system stability and effectively manages fluctuations. It is crucial to keep the inverters operating within their specified limits and utilize the VAR Generator for any additional reactive power requirements.\n\nRequirements:\n- Calculation of total reactive power contributed by the inverters based on the number online and their individual capacities.\n- Allocation of remaining reactive power to be managed by the VAR Generator.\n- Implementation of a control strategy capable of handling fluctuations and maintaining system stability.\n\nCurrent Approach:\nTo calculate the total reactive power provided by the inverters, the number of online inverters is multiplied by their capacities, with the total capped at 60%. Any remaining reactive power is then assigned to the VAR Generator.\n\nIn conclusion, what is the most efficient and reliable method for achieving an optimal, stable operation of the system?","replies_count":5,"page_name":"optimizing-reactive-power-distribution-for-system-stability","post_date":"13-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Best Programming Cable Options for FX2N PLC – SC-09 Model Explained","user_name":"efratalove","content":"Hello everyone,\nI have a FX2N PLC and I am in need of a programming cable, specifically the SC-09 model.

I'm reaching out today because I'm struggling to solve a recurring issue with a site I'm associated with. Their SLC 5/03s keep losing their programs. Despite replacing all the batteries, the problem persists. The 5/03 is connected to a PanelView 550 via the DH485 port, and a drive via the RS232 port. I have a UIC and CP3 cable set. Since this site is remote, they sent me the PLCs to reprogram. I can successfully download the program using either the UIC or CP3. However, after downloading the program, I receive a message stating, \"you will lose communications from both ports.\" Subsequently, I am unable to connect to the PLC on either port using DF1 or DH485 through the UIC and CP3. I have provided a picture displaying the program comms settings and the error warning. The issue arises when they install the PLC back into their rack, as it fails to communicate with the HMI or drive. While programming in my rack, there are no faults, but once installed at the site, the FLT light starts flashing along with the DH485 green light solid. I'm struggling to identify the cause of this issue and need to resolve it before flying out to the site.

I pointed out various activities that appeared questionable. In this thread, I shared my thoughts. I am interested in hearing about more examples—specifically 'what' and not 'who'. There are two areas where actions can seem foolish. Firstly, conducting risky tests to uncover potential failures that may not be evident. Secondly, performing intrusive maintenance on equipment that is in good working condition. Let's delve into some examples of dangerous tests. One incident that deeply affected me involved the loss of a Boeing 707 aircraft and its crew. A concerning test involved shutting down two engines on one wing simultaneously, causing the aircraft to spin. A tragic outcome occurred during a training session when the student pilot failed to recover from this scenario, resulting in a fatal crash. Another noteworthy example is the blackout of controlled airspace at Sydney's airport due to a test on the UPS system during peak hours. This disruption caused chaos in the skies, leading to potential risks for incoming flights. Additionally, I have observed alarming testing procedures for lifts in underground mines, which could potentially damage the equipment and endanger workers. Moving on to intrusive maintenance practices, mandatory inspections can sometimes be excessive, leading to unnecessary risks and potential failures. For instance, dismantling and reassembling components like engines, even when they show no signs of wear or corrosion, can introduce new issues and compromise safety. These practices highlight the importance of conducting thorough risk assessments and exploring alternative testing methods to avoid destructive outcomes.

In the example, the function of the system is to provide 20 horsepower to the fan, ensuring that it spins at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). The functional failure in this case is the complete loss of power. The potential failure modes include gear wear and cracking due to fatigue, among others.\n\nBased on the severity of the risk associated with fan failure, it seems reasonable to implement proactive vibration monitoring as a preventive maintenance task. Do you agree with this assessment? \n\nFor the functional failure of \"No Power Supply,\" potential failure modes could include tripped motor breakers, cable faults, earth faults on the motor, or interruptions in mains power. In the case of a transmission failure, potential modes could include worn or sheared motor couplings, especially if they are geared couplings.\n\nIt is important to consider other proactive maintenance tasks, such as earth-resistance testing and lubrication of couplings, to address potential causes of functional failures. Vibration monitoring may not be as effective in preventing functional failures related to loss of power.

I am aware that in order for effective communication to occur, all devices must be on the same subnet. However, due to the significant distance between them, it is impractical to establish direct connections or connect through a single network switch.\n\nMy strategy is to link each device to the closest Ethernet port provided by the IT department for intranet connections in the plant. These ports automatically assign IP addresses to connected devices, which may or may not fall within the same subnet. For example, devices on the 3rd floor have IP addresses in the subnet 172.16.103.x, whereas those on the ground floor use 172.16.102.x. Despite being on different subnets, devices on different floors can still communicate, likely due to IT's routing configurations for plant-wide connectivity. While I am uncertain, this setup gives me hope that my PLC on the first floor can communicate with a Weight Transmitter on the 3rd floor.\n\nHowever, my concern lies in the manual assignment of IP addresses to each device. I question whether devices on separate subnets can communicate in this scenario. Additionally, I am unsure if the networks on the 3rd and 1st floors are physically connected, as my knowledge of network infrastructure is limited.\n\nBefore proceeding with the project and purchasing equipment, I need clarification on these aspects.

In his column, Trap Christer Idhammar discusses the importance of using RCM wisely and highlights the common pitfalls in its application. Many organizations rush into RCM training programs without proper preparation, leading to confusion and inefficiency in maintenance practices. The debate on the definition of RCM continues within the maintenance management community, with some insisting on strict adherence to prescribed methods.\n\nRCM is most effective when applied during the specification and design of new equipment, as well as for existing critical and intricate systems. However, the analysis process can become unnecessarily convoluted, resulting in little practical change in maintenance routines. Often, essential components like V-belt drives are still inspected during shutdowns, despite RCM recommendations.\n\nBefore embarking on RCM implementation, it is advisable to focus on improving maintenance prevention, basic inspections, and predictive maintenance practices. These activities are relatively easy to implement and can be done with minimal cost and effort. Utilizing standard training materials can help in training personnel effectively and ensuring inspections are carried out correctly.\n\nIn conclusion, RCM should be selectively used for critical and complex systems, rather than seen as a comprehensive maintenance solution. It is essential to establish strong foundational practices before delving into more complex maintenance strategies to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in maintenance operations. Remember, RCM is a tool, not a complete maintenance system.","replies_count":3,"page_name":"optimizing-reliability-centered-maintenance-rcm-for-critical-and-complex-equipment-common-pitfalls-and-best-practices","post_date":"21-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Establishing Equipment Hierarchy in Industrial Power Plants: Seeking Industry Standards and Refinery Templates","user_name":"jim Perpinan","content":"In an industrial power plant setting, we are reorganizing the equipment groups and seeking industry standards to establish an equipment hierarchy.

Yesterday, we encountered several communication alarms across the network. To troubleshoot the issue, I first checked the voltage levels on the CAN high and low lines, which were within the appropriate range: CAN H measured between 2.6 to 2.9V and CAN L between 2.1 to 2.5V. I then powered down the system and tested the resistance between CAN H and CAN L, which showed a reading of 43 ohms. Given that there should be two 120-ohm terminating resistors at each end, I expected the reading to be around 60 ohms.\n\nOne aspect that puzzled me was the presence of multiple CAN adapters. Some of these adapters split the CAN signal into separate loops, each with its own set of resistors. I am unsure whether these additional loops and resistors form distinct networks or if they are part of the network under investigation. The specific network I am addressing is highlighted in green boxes in the provided image, while the other loops connected to the same adapter are marked in red. I am uncertain if these additional loops have any impact on my network since they originate from the same adapter.\n\nAfter observing the 43-ohm resistance reading, I suspected that superfluous resistors might be influencing the network. To test this theory, I disabled the terminator switch at the last node, which raised the network's resistance to 70 ohms. Surprisingly, this action resolved the communication issues. While it is standard practice for the last node to have its terminator enabled, this adjustment brought the network's resistance closer to the expected 60 ohms, temporarily solving the problem.\n\nCurrently, I am seeking to identify the root cause of this issue. I would appreciate insights on the following questions: What could have caused the 43-ohm resistance measurement in the loop? Do the additional loops/devices attached to the CAN adapters impact the network I am analyzing? Why did deactivating the last resistor switch restore communication, even though my network initially only had two terminators? Was this switch the key factor in aligning the network resistance around 60 ohms?","replies_count":8,"page_name":"troubleshooting-communication-alarms-in-can-network-impact-of-additional-loops-and-resistor-switches","post_date":"20-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Transfer Input Data to a User Defined Type (UDT) with Specific Bit Selections","user_name":"patrickmoneyy","content":"I am in need of assistance as I am experiencing tunnel vision and struggling to remember the process.

Our company plans to incorporate Factory Talk Asset Center in the coming months, necessitating all equipment to be connected to a single network. While most machines are already networked in preparation for this transition, we are experiencing time synchronization alarms on three machines. These alarms, such as Clock Sync Alarm and Clock Jitter Alarm, are affecting two machines running on 5069-L310ERM and one on 5069-L320ERM controllers. To address this issue, it is crucial to have only one system time master on the network, ensuring consistency across all machines.\nFor example, Machine 1 has its first port set to 192.168.0.10 connected to the main network, with the second port linked to Kinetix 5500 at 192.168.1.1. Similarly, Machine 2 and Machine 3 are configured in a similar manner. One potential solution could be using NAT routers on each machine to help maintain the controllers on the same network while ensuring the drives recognize the connected controller as the time master.\nAdditionally, there seems to be a performance lag when online with any of these controllers, possibly linked to the time synchronization issues. This lag is evident when the mouse cursor intermittently becomes the blue processing circle, indicating a delay in execution. Addressing the time synchronization problem among the three controllers may improve overall system performance.","replies_count":8,"page_name":"optimizing-performance-with-time-synchronization-for-motion-controllers-and-servo-motors","post_date":"25-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Are there Terminal Blocks with both Fuses and MOVs available?","user_name":"Ruskied","content":"I am seeking solutions to incorporate MOVs and fuses for solenoid PLC outputs within a compact panel.

Despite my efforts to find solutions on various forums, I have not been successful in finding exactly what I need. To provide more clarity, I will provide detailed information. The two attached PDF files illustrate that the test \"works\" but does not increment as desired. I believe implementing some mathematical calculations could resolve this issue. However, I am seeking a more straightforward and efficient approach.\n\nThe main issue at hand is controlling three pumps in a rotation sequence, specifically Lead, Lag, Lag2. The control tank dictates which pumps to activate based on preset level setpoints. Firstly, Lead is activated; if it cannot maintain the required level, Lag is then activated. If the level continues to drop, Lag2 is activated. Once the set level is reached, the pumps turn off and move to the next in rotation.\n\nCurrently, I am using three counters to manage the rotation status of the pumps. My current code, although functional to some extent, requires manual intervention when a pump becomes unavailable. I am not satisfied with this method as it does not automatically adjust when the pump is back in service. My aim is to establish a seamless rotation where if a pump is temporarily removed, the system switches to a lead-lag operation until the pump is back online, at which point it seamlessly integrates back into the rotation sequence.\n\nIn essence, I require the pumps to rotate in a lead-lag-lag2 sequence consistently. For instance, the rotation order would be Lead, Lag, Lag2, then rotate after Lead drops, Lag2, Lead, Lag, and so on. If Pump 1 is temporarily out of service, the rotation would switch between Pumps 2 and 3, but upon Pump 1's return, it would resume its position in the sequence.\n\nThe counters used for rotation are as follows:\n- Pump 1 rotation counter: C5:3\n- Pump 2 rotation counter: C5:4\n- Pump 3 rotation counter: C5:4\n\nI have relocated the counters' accumulation to N10:40, 41, and 42 respectively. If the explanation above is unclear, please let me know. I am open to any examples, resources, or guidance related to this issue.

However, there are concerns about PTP causing excessive network traffic due to frequent time updates.\n\nAlthough the 1756-TIME module is an option, the client prefers to communicate directly with the time server without purchasing additional equipment. Is it feasible for the time server to respond to PTP time requests and sync the PLCs accordingly? One potential solution is to have a master PLC query the time server and then instruct the other PLCs to sync their time accordingly.\n\nIf using PTP, is it possible to schedule time synchronization instead of constant syncing? For example, initiating a time sync only at specific times (e.g., 8 am) to minimize network traffic.\n\nAlternatively, would it be more practical to invest in the 1756-TIME module despite its cost?

To address this, I developed a small data logger to collect data in a DINT array and then transfer it to a file. Throughout this process, I faced a challenge that required me to seek solutions from online forums. This made me consider if there's a more streamlined approach to handling this task, as the current method involves several variables. It was also interesting to learn that CODESYS uses '$R$N' to represent CRLF (carriage return and line feed) for Windows OS line endings.\n\nAs I continue this project, I plan to incorporate error handling and verification for file operations.

When it comes to maintaining molded case circuit breakers, what guidelines should be followed? Commonly assumed failure modes include loose connections and mechanical failures preventing opening. Our chosen predictive maintenance technique for lighting and distribution panels is thermography. In the case of a critical molded case breaker, what amp rating makes it impractical to continue tripping tests and instead opt for replacement every 5 years - 50A, 250A, or 400A? It is crucial to ensure the trip mechanism is functioning properly, as this type of failure can go undetected. With limited information on the root causes of electrical equipment failures, it is essential to consider NETA or NFPA recommendations for guidance.

However, during the regression test conducted before the official launch, we encountered two issues that need to be addressed. \n\nThe first issue involves the incorrect consideration of available capacity in transaction CM33 when using the filter. The second issue pertains to the incorrect assignment of sort criteria to the charts in the Graphical Planning board created for the Corus maintenance department. The screen is divided into three separate sections: \n1. Workcenter load by Workcenter (Dispatched)\n2. Workcenter Load by operation (Dispatched)\n3. Operation pool (Not Dispatched)\n\nStarting with the Sort issue, there are two Sort criteria assigned to the second chart and three to the third chart. However, there seems to be a cross-linking issue between the assignments, as selecting one chart may display the sort criteria of the other. Additionally, the operations are not sorting consecutively as expected. \n\nThe more crucial problem lies in the filter and its impact on the correct consideration of available capacity. The standard SAP Filter (5KFIL4) assigned in the selection profile is causing dispatched operations to overlook the actual available capacity when the filter is activated. This issue became apparent when the workcenter became overloaded with dispatched orders, which is unacceptable. \n\nTo resolve these issues, we seek assistance from anyone who may have a solution.

However, when it comes to 24vdc input signals, the scenario is different. In my experience, there is typically no signal isolation for 24v discrete input signals into PLC cards. Recently, I was discussing a project with an application engineer where my customer was replacing a panel. The integrators sent a panel with 120vac relays to convert the input signals, assuming they were 120vac when they were actually 24vdc. The previous setup had the 24v input signals directly going into the PLC without a relay.\n\nWhen I decided to switch out the 120vac relays for the 24v input signals, I didn't see the necessity for using a relay for signal isolation. I believed that the input card didn't draw enough amps to warrant a relay, and saw relays as potential points of failure. However, the engineer expressed concerns about burnt-out inputs and disclaimed responsibility for such outcomes. I have not encountered many burnt-out inputs in the past, if any.

Rockwell's documentation on this process is currently limited, but I am actively working on gathering more information through a ticket with Rockwell. I will continue to update my findings as I progress.\n\nIf you're looking for guidance on configuring the OPC server, take note of the following TechNotes:\n- QA67230 - Key details on OPC UA in version 36\n- QA67231 - Steps to activate OPC server/client\n- QA67232 - Tutorial on utilizing OPC client\n\nPlease be aware that my notes mainly focus on the OPC server, as I have not yet delved into the client side. My testing has been conducted on the 1756-L81E and 1756-L82E models. After consulting with tech support, it appears that the 1756-L81E (along with similar models supporting a maximum of 0 OPC nodes) does not fully support OPC, although it does have the OPC CIP object.\n\nFor connecting to the OPC server, you can refer to the following details:\n- OPC Discovery URL: http://address:4840\n- OPC TCP URL: opc.tcp://address:4840\n- Supported Connection Modes: Basic256Sha256 (Sign and Encrypt), None (No encryption or verification, Insecure)\n\nRegarding tag addressing, controller tags are stored in namespace 6 and can be referenced by name. For instance, a controller tag named \"TEST\" will have an OPC address of \"ns=6;s=TEST.\" Program tags are referenced with the prefix \"Program:\" followed by the program name and tag name, such as \"ns=6;s=Program:MainProgram.PROG_TEST.\"\n\nWhen it comes to OPC server configuration, you will need to send a message to the controller to enable or disable the OPC server. This setting will be retained after a download, and I recommend using the S:FS (First Scan Bit) to initiate the enable message to ensure OPC activation. By default, the OPC server/client is disabled.\n\nFor more details on setting up the OPC server, including node counts and performance tests, as well as undocumented messages for additional functionality, please refer to my detailed findings above. I hope this information proves beneficial to your understanding of OPC server setup ~ Trevor.","replies_count":20,"page_name":"ultimate-guide-to-setting-up-controllogix-v36-opc-ua-server-for-maximum-performance","post_date":"17-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Remove nvm from Your System: DIY Troubleshooting Guide","user_name":"thekokiko","content":"I was able to resolve my problem independently, but I'm unsure of how to remove it from the system.","replies_count":1,"page_name":"how-to-remove-nvm-from-your-system-diy-troubleshooting-guide","post_date":"05-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting Overlapping Toolbars in Logix Designer","user_name":"roxusa","content":"I am learning how to arrange the template for my controls in Logix Designer, as I have experience with RS500 and RS5000.

Despite low vibration levels with all vibration at 1X, no laser alignment can be performed due to limited space. To simplify changes, we have started using a two-piece coupling insert. Strobing the coupling reveals distortion, with the metal center retaining ring beginning to bend. Evaluating the coupling size, it appears borderline between #9 and #10, potentially causing the repeated failures. Other pumps with #9 couplings do not exhibit similar problems. Any suggestions on measurements or further steps to identify the issue with this specific pump would be appreciated.

It is commonly accepted that a typical quadrature encoder will have Output A leading Output B in phase when rotating in a clockwise direction. However, determining what is considered \"clockwise\" can be a bit confusing. This often depends on which end of the shaft you are looking at. I am specifically concerned with a standard solid-shaft encoder, such as the SICK DFS25 series. According to the IEC standard (IEC 60034-8), clockwise is defined as the direction in which an electric motor spins when viewed from the load side, with the output shaft facing the observer. However, despite encoders having a shaft like a motor, they are actually the driven device. This raises the question of whether the standard direction for \"clockwise\" should be considered from the opposite side of the device. This topic has become relevant as I am attempting to replace an old DRS26 encoder with a modern DFS25A model. The modern encoders offer programmable phase direction, with instructions from the machine builder to set the direction as \"A leads B at CCW.\" In contrast, the old encoders simply \"follow the standard,\" leaving some uncertainty regarding what the standard actually is. Given the complexity of swapping pins with these particular connectors, which are difficult to obtain, I want to ensure that I make the correct choice on my first attempt.","replies_count":6,"page_name":"understanding-quadrature-encoder-directionality-clockwise-definition-and-shaft-orientation","post_date":"15-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Reset Counter on Delta HMI using DEL + 0 Function Keys","user_name":"bambam79","content":"I am upgrading from an OP7 to a new Delta HMI.

Hello everyone, at my power plant we utilize a fuel gas compressor (specifically a one-stage centrifugal type) to increase the fuel gas pressure from 24 bar(a) to 33 bar(a) for our gas turbine engine. With a fuel gas flow rate of approximately 65,000 kg/hr and a compressor rotation speed of 31,800 rpm, we have experienced the compressor tripping more than 6 times in the last 6 months, resulting in plant shutdowns.

These switches became part of my home lab, where I discovered that some of them supported Power Over Ethernet (POE). Although I initially didn't pay much attention to this feature, I had plans to connect VOIP Cisco phones, which necessitated POE. However, due to the frequent relocation of my home lab from the kitchen to the basement, office, garage, and elsewhere, I misplaced the \"wall wart\" power adapter for one of the switches. Despite labeling and organizing bins and boxes, the adapter remained elusive, hindering the set-up of a new lab configuration.\n\nIn the meantime, I connected all the Ethernet cables to proceed without the adapter. To my surprise, the switch displayed error codes through flashing status lights, even though it was not receiving power.

It may seem challenging since the protective device is typically in standby mode while the protected device is active or inactive. Is there a way to determine the Uptime and Downtime of the protective device to assess its availability? Additionally, are there alternative methods to identify the Failure Finding Interval aside from Moubray's approach? Thank you for your insights.","replies_count":4,"page_name":"understanding-failure-finding-interval-in-rcm2-methodology-hidden-failures-and-protective-device-availability","post_date":"20-07-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Address a Maintenance Nightmare: A Guide to Managing Constant Fire-Fighting Mode and 30% Product Changeover Rate","user_name":"Richard Orlick","content":"In need of guidance on how to address a maintenance nightmare?

A PLC5-40 Series C Enhanced has been functioning smoothly for a long time. Recently, one specific output, O:012/11, which controls a relay for the run contacts of a PowerFlex 40, has started flickering a few times per minute. This anomaly has not been observed with any other outputs. Could it be a faulty triac or supporting component?\n\nSystem Overview: In this setup, O/0 is not in use. Outputs O/1 to O/5 are utilized for three starters and two PowerFlex 40 run relays that operate continuously during production. Outputs O/6 to O/12 are responsible for controlling the run relays for discharge belts of five material supply hoppers. Each hopper holds approximately 2.5 hours of material and discharges until empty before moving to the next hopper. Outputs O/13 to O/17 control reverse relays for unused hopper drives. The system consists of 7 inputs, 3 outputs, 1 analog input, and 3 analog outputs.\n\nThe Issue: Recently, a discharge process began experiencing sudden stops and restarts. Upon investigation, it was found that the run relay was intermittently flickering off every few minutes. After inspecting the wiring and scoping the output, it was discovered that truncated half waves were randomly occurring, causing the run relay to drop out. This led to disruptions in the production process.\n\nAttempts to Resolve: In an attempt to address the issue, a coworker replaced the problematic module during a brief downtime. However, the first replacement had a backplane connection issue, causing the entire module to flicker unless physically held in place. A second replacement initially appeared to function properly but was later found to have a stuck output. Subsequent testing with a used module seemed to temporarily resolve the problem, but the flickering issue persisted during production.\n\nNext Steps: Considering the ongoing issue, the next course of action would be to replace the backplane during the next available opportunity. This situation presents a unique challenge that is both frustrating and intriguing. Has anyone encountered a similar problem or have any alternative solutions to suggest?\n\nAppendix: Attached is an example of the issue and a picture of the equipment in question, which is nearing retirement. The scope reading shows 118V during a full wave, dropping to 108V during the occurrence of the flicker.","replies_count":3,"page_name":"troubleshooting-plc5-output-module-1771-oad-flickering-run-relay-issue-detected","post_date":"24-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Top Layer 3 Network Switches DIN RAIL MOUNT Suppliers in Alabama, USA","user_name":"mad4x4","content":"Are you in need of Layer 3 Network Switches DIN RAIL MOUNT suppliers in Alabama?

Recently, I have been paying closer attention to the operands in the CPT instruction in my programming. I noticed an interesting behavior when using expressions like N7[37,1] - N7[35,1]. Upon hovering over N7[37,1], an error message appears: \"Invalid Tag Element: N7[37,1] - N7Tag Data Type: DINT[304,3]\". However, by adjusting the expression to (N7[37,1]) - N7[35,1], the error message changes to: \"Tag Element: N7[37,1] Element Data Type: DINT\". \n\nThis led me to consider the possibility of confusion between NEG and SUB functions in the CPT. For instance, when using 150 - N7[35,1], hovering over 150 displays \"Undefined Tag: 150 - N7[35,1]\". But when I enclose 150 in parenthesis like this: (150) - N7[35,1], it correctly shows \"Value: 150\".\n\nWhile I have successfully used similar logic in other programs without any issues, I found this behavior intriguing. Thankfully, there have been no problems with other mathematical operations. I appreciate any insights or advice on this matter.

I am seeking assistance in addressing an issue of unstable vibration in the air fans at a waste water treatment facility. The system consists of 3 belt-driven air fans with a motor speed of 1470 RPM and fan speed of 820 RPM (overhung fan). After collecting vibration data on December 11, 2023, I found that 2 out of 3 fans exhibited high vibration levels, with amplitudes around 10 mm/s in the motor and 7 mm/s in the fan bearings. The FFT analysis revealed a predominant frequency of 820 CPM in both motor and fan bearings, indicating a possible unbalance issue. I performed balancing on December 12, 2023, which temporarily reduced the vibration levels to around 3 mm/s and 2 mm/s in the fans. However, the vibration amplitudes started increasing again with a dominant frequency of 820 CPM after a day of operation. Despite cleaning and replacing filters, checking mounting locations, and confirming damper positions, the issue persisted. Subsequent tests on December 16, 2024, showed vibration levels of around 16 mm/s (motor) and 8 mm/s (fan) with the same dominant frequency. Even after attempting to balance Air Fan 1 with a correction mass of 170 grams, the vibration levels fluctuated, reaching as high as 12 mm/s within a couple of days. It is important to note that the fans draw air from the atmosphere and discharge gases from the waste water, resulting in wet fan impellers during operation. The housing may contain water during start-up, which the client drains before starting the fans. Your insights on the attached data would be greatly appreciated.

Today, I am dealing with a specific issue regarding Modbus ProSoft for the first time. The customer's setup is confusing, but we have to work with it. Typically, in a complete Modbus setup with a Schneider PLC and a Magelis/Harmony screen, I follow a certain process for commands. On the screen, I set _CMD with %MXXXX to 1. The PLC then receives this command, pulses the \"usable output\" of the CMD block for 3 seconds (while %MXXXX is high), and then sets %MXXXX back to 0 after the 3 seconds, indicating that the screen is ready for the next command. This process ensures that the command is not lost between Modbus scans and prevents it from being latched in the PLC if communication with the HMI/SCADA is lost.\n\nNow, when it comes to the Modbus ProSoft on a 1756 rack, there are separate data arrays for Read and Write commands. One array is for Read commands (Read commands and SP from screen), while the other is for Write commands (Write statuses to the screen). I am unsure if what I want to achieve can be done with this setup. If not, I would appreciate guidance on best practices for commands in such a setup. \n\nCurrently, I am facing an issue where changing a \"read\" value from the screen in the PLC is not reflecting on the screen due to communication limitations. I am exploring options to resolve this issue, such as manipulating the read/write arrays over the same register. If this proves to be complex, I am considering alternative methods for achieving the desired outcome. Any suggestions or insights on pulsing from InTouch would be greatly appreciated.

I am currently employed at POSCO, a leading steel manufacturing company located in South Korea. I have recently embarked on the journey of implementing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) at my plant, which specializes in producing hot coils (hot strips). While the RCM concept is promising, I am aware of the challenges faced by the maintenance department at POSCO back in 2000 when the Maximo system was first introduced.\n\nPresently, our maintenance approach at POSCO primarily involves Preventive Maintenance, Condition-Based Maintenance, and a Condition Monitoring System tailored to our specific needs. However, one issue that plagues me is the size of our contracted maintenance crew. With a fixed crew size of 1400 men spread across various mechanical sections such as hot rolling mill, cold rolling mill, iron making, steel making, and stainless steel making, it becomes challenging to meet the demands of each section.\n\nDespite efforts to streamline Preventive Maintenance tasks, such as reducing the number of PM items to align with our ideal plan, many tasks end up being canceled or delayed due to manpower constraints. This hinders our ability to proactively address maintenance tasks as recommended by RCM. The crew scheduling restrictions imposed by the administration, influenced by the partner company's employment policy, further exacerbate the situation.\n\nIn my section, the hot rolling mill plant, maintenance schedules revolve around two main types: Weekly Change Down (CD) requiring 130M/D on Mondays and Monthly Shutdown (SD) requiring 180M/D on Mondays. The rest of the weekdays typically require 40M/D. The administration justifies the constraints on crew size by citing the financial risks associated with employing a larger workforce, especially during periods when their services are not fully utilized.\n\nI am eager to learn from other companies facing similar challenges and how they have managed to navigate through such circumstances. The struggle to implement RCM in my company amidst manpower limitations is weighing heavily on me, particularly with 14 hours of production line stoppage (failure) recorded in my two plants. The administration emphasizes the importance of avoiding failures, adding to the pressure of finding a sustainable solution.","replies_count":20,"page_name":"managing-preventive-maintenance-backlog-challenges-during-rcm-implementation","post_date":"06-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting FTView Display Issue: Values Displaying as *","user_name":"thehoneybadger","content":"Greetings everyone,\nI have been diligently working on my Human Machine Interface (HMI) with FTview for over a year now without any major issues.

While I successfully connected the 1756-OBV8S to a servo drive safe-off through direct wiring, I encountered difficulties when attempting to activate a 24V Coil Allen-Bradley 700S emergency stop relay. The Card Output consistently faulted whenever an attempt was made to activate the relay. The issue was set aside as the relay was intended for future use, but now the need arises to replace multiple hardwired 120V relays with Safety PLC controlled 24V relays.\n\nAs I delved into the AB knowledgebase, it became evident that others have faced similar challenges. One technote suggested incorporating diodes to avoid faults when connecting in Bipolar mode, although this was not applicable in my case. The card was configured for sourcing, with the output wires connected to the relay coil+ and the relay coil- wired to 24V common.\n\nAnother technote implied the necessity of employing a SELV/PELV listed 24V power supply. Surprisingly, my search for a SELC power supply on the AB platform yielded no results. Additionally, a technote raised concerns about the reliability of the modules, citing incidents of False Overload Faults with OBV8S/OBV8SK in Sourcing mode.\n\nIn response to this issue, a firmware update (V2.011) and Add-On Profile (V2.01) were released for 5069-OBV8S / 5069-OBV8SK modules, while a resolution for 1756-OBV8S / 1756-OBV8SK V1.011 is expected in a future firmware update.\n\nIn light of these challenges, my queries to the group are as follows:\n1. Has anyone successfully utilized a 1756-OBV8S card? Any insights to share?\n2. Is a SELV power supply indispensable for its operation?\n3. I recently acquired 700-HN123 8-pin safety relays to assist in activating the larger 700S relays, in case of a potential load issue. Has anyone else encountered this scenario?\n\nGiven the delayed delivery of the 1756-OBV8s, it may have been more prudent to opt for PointIO initially.","replies_count":6,"page_name":"troubleshooting-faults-with-ab-1756-obv8s-in-safety-relay-activation","post_date":"24-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting issue with saving modified values in AOI using L84E PLC","user_name":"Marcus_Orelius","content":"Hello everyone, I am experiencing a problem with saving a modified value in an AOI (Add-On Instruction) using a L84E PLC.

Specifically, I am looking into how to factor in the presence of buffers in the overall availability assessment. The mine has two main systems and an auxiliary system that hoist ore up through a central shaft. \n\nThere are two methods we use to calculate availability: one involves using data on breakdowns, operations, idling, and preventive maintenance hours over a set period to determine availability. The other method considers Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). \n\nFor example, if we have 10 pieces of equipment in one of the systems (such as bins, conveyors, crushers), and we treat it as a series system where the failure of one component can halt production, the overall availability is the product of each equipment's availability. \n\nHowever, I am unsure about how to account for equipment like bins or ore passes that have capacity buffers. Even if the lower conveyor fails, the bin several levels above can still receive ore and remain operational. Should I exclude these buffers and focus solely on the mechanical equipment for availability calculations?

These platforms effectively display performance metrics through charts and graphs, with some offering more visually appealing graphics. While some options like PowerBI are cost-effective, they have limitations when it comes to handling large amounts of data, especially real-time data, and may not be as engaging as dynamic visualizations seen in everyday media like games or movies. On the other hand, Digital Twins (DTs) require significant data inputs, making them expensive to develop and maintain. A full-scale DT can take months or even years to create, potentially causing delays in implementation. While DTs are valuable for tasks like designing jet engines, they may not be as effective for modeling real-time asset data. Recognizing this gap, we propose the concept of an Agile Digital Twin that bridges the divide between traditional dashboards and DTs. This approach would offer a middle ground in terms of data volume, cost-effectiveness, and speed of implementation, blending a development philosophy with streamlined technical requirements.

However, discussing political and social issues in relation to environmental sustainability is important. When it comes to recycling, it is worth noting that used wine bottles are not simply recycled; instead, they are crushed and repurposed into new glass, often of lower quality. This process consumes a significant amount of energy due to the unique designs of wine bottles, resulting in different shapes and colors for each winery. Unlike wine bottles, beer bottles are typically recycled through supermarkets or wine stores, which charge a refundable deposit to ensure they are returned. In the past, glass bottles from beverages like coke and pepsi were also recycled, but the lack of standardization in wine bottle designs poses a challenge. Wineries often focus on their wine and labeling to sell their products, rather than using uniform bottle shapes. By embracing more standardized recycling practices, significant cost savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved.","replies_count":14,"page_name":"the-impact-of-recycling-wine-bottles-on-environmental-sustainability","post_date":"08-09-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting PLC Limitations for Simulating Multiple Slaves","user_name":"plcQ24","content":"I'm currently working on a project involving a master PLC with slave definitions for 10 different slaves.

One major issue is the presence of outdated and cumbersome 1995 schematics pages that serve as P&ID drawings. While these are nice to have, they are not practical for day-to-day operations, especially since InTouch does not support vector scaling, making it difficult to utilize them effectively in a 16:9 format.\n\nI have taken it upon myself to create new operational pages for the commissioning process, as the existing setup leaves much to be desired. Recently, the customer expressed a desire to retain the P&ID pages as their team struggles to interpret P&ID DWGs. I am considering placing them in pop-ups or leaving them unscaled, but this would result in a disjointed testing process during commissioning.\n\nAdditionally, the customer has requested that all analog values boxes (approximately 100-120 values) be able to open pop-ups displaying detailed information about the value. While this feature may have been useful in a different context, it does not add significant value to this particular unmanned station, where operators are restricted from altering most values.\n\nThe customer has also mentioned a WW report generation solution, which I have not encountered before. I am unsure if this solution is compatible with InTouch Standalone or a Galaxy system. Considering the customer's evolving needs and the desire for a comprehensive SCADA system, I am contemplating the transition to a Galaxy platform, despite the inherent challenges and learning curve associated with it.\n\nIn conclusion, I am seeking advice on how to proceed with implementing the requested features, such as the \"faceplate\" pop-up for analog values, and whether transitioning to a Galaxy system would be a more suitable long-term solution. Additionally, any insights on the compatibility of the WW report generation solution with the existing setup would be greatly appreciated.

While I cannot disclose the specific details of the process, I can provide an overview of the type of motion I aim to achieve.\n\nThe rotary Servo will be responsible for moving a fixed amount (e.g. 10 degrees) to advance one \"slot\" on the outer diameter of the wheel it is connected to (consisting of 36 slots).

The rotary should rotate swiftly while the pusher is not in a collision zone, pausing momentarily when necessary.\n\nIn this setup, the rotary's movement should ideally be continuous to minimize time wastage, although it must still align with the pusher's actions. The design includes a conical tip on the pusher, allowing for overlap in movement between the pusher and the rotary without causing any collisions.\n\nWhile considering the use of a MACP, limitations in the cam profile may necessitate the creation of a virtual master for proper synchronization.

I am currently facing a challenge with a proportional valve on a PID loop in an aluminum saw setup. The Process Variable (PV) in this case represents the amps at the saw blade, while the Controlled Variable (CV) is the proportional valve that regulates the feed rate. \n\nThe issue arises during the initial movement of the blade, where the amp draw is minimal before it makes contact with the metal. This results in the feed operating at maximum output, set at a limit of 50% within the PID. Once the blade hits the metal, it accelerates at full speed, causing a sudden surge in current and damaging the saw blades. \n\nTo address this problem, I have implemented a ramp down timer to gradually control the valve output, starting quickly and slowing down as it approaches the metal. Once the current surpasses the idle level, the PID takes over the control. However, a new challenge has emerged where the PID's output remains at 50% when it transitions, leading to a sudden increase in blade load before readjusting. \n\nIs there a way to configure the PID to start at a lower output, such as 20%, and then gradually increase if necessary to meet the cycle time and blade load requirements? This adjustment aims to prevent the initial spike in current when the PID assumes control. Please refer to the attached screenshot for a visual representation of the issue.","replies_count":38,"page_name":"optimizing-proportional-valve-control-in-aluminum-saw-setup-for-smooth-feed-operation","post_date":"14-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Pros and Cons of Implementing Suborder Functionality for Efficient Workload Management","user_name":"lisa wrightson","content":"My current assignment entails evaluating the feasibility of implementing suborder functionality for handling sizeable maintenance tasks that involve significant resources.

However, I have heard from my engineering department that setting up an AB servo with a standard PLC can be more time-consuming compared to using a PLC with motion capabilities. Despite all our applications involving simple point-to-point movements on a single axis, it seems that programming an AB servo without motion options on the PLC may present challenges.\n\nIn my experience with programming single-axis, point-to-point applications, the process involves three main tasks. Firstly, configuring the hardware and setting up the I/O in the servo controller to define parameters such as distance, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and run triggers. Secondly, developing code to execute motion commands, handle mode types, pass parameters, monitor feedback, and manage faults in a servo-agnostic manner, applicable to different servo makes and models. Finally, creating specific motion logic for the application, including sequences for triggering motion commands and handling feedback and faults.\n\nI wonder if similar programming principles can be applied to an AB servo controller and whether utilizing an AB PLC with motion capabilities would offer any efficiency advantages. It is unclear to me why our engineers encounter prolonged setup times for each application, considering that once the initial configuration and code abstraction are complete, the process becomes more streamlined and reusable. The remaining task of coding each motion call is akin to programming cylinders, suggesting that the overall programming process should not be significantly different.\n\nI hope this explanation sheds light on the programming process for those seeking clarity on the topic.

The problem arises when the DCS communication link to the L33ER controller (which communicates via an ALE111 card over ethernet/IP) is lost intermittently, resulting in a fault on the DCS (A320 - 'connection shutdown when transmitting to the connected socket'). This issue only occurs with the updated L33ER controllers, while the previous L32 controllers had no such problems.\n\nDespite the communication loss between the PLC and DCS, I can still ping the PLC and ALE cards without any issues, and Studio5000 does not disconnect. Additionally, there are no fault counts in the controller diagnostics that indicate any issues. Upon further investigation, I noticed recurring messages in the advanced diagnostics section of the controller's webpage, specifically 'CipStatus: Generated on device' and 'Connection timeout notification'. These messages appear every 52 minutes but do not seem to directly correlate with the DCS communication fault.\n\nI tried upgrading the firmware to the latest version V33, but the recurring messages persist. Interestingly, re-downloading the properties of the ALE111 card temporarily stops the spamming of these messages and resolves the communication dropouts on the DCS. However, cycling the power to the PLC clears the event log but reintroduces the recurring messages and DCS communication issues.\n\nI am uncertain if the event log spamming is a normal occurrence or a sign of an underlying issue. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Despite the original plan for a 2-hour session on Root Cause Failure Analysis, my speaking time was cut short to 1.5 hours. During the conference, another presenter discussed Lean Manufacturing and its impact on their plant, specifically highlighting the reduction of maintenance staff from 36 to 6 due to multi-skilling. This led to questions about the fate of the remaining employees, with the presenter jokingly saying they were retired.\n\nThis raised concerns for me about the true intentions of Lean Manufacturing – is it designed to push people into retirement? I believe there are two key factors that Lean Manufacturing overlooks. Firstly, multi-skilling may not be suitable if anthropometric factors come into play, as highlighted in John Moubray's RCM book. Secondly, the broad spectrum of roles within maintenance, including spare parts management, CMMS, reliability groups, and various technical roles, should be considered before downsizing.\n\nRather than forcing employees into retirement, why not reassign them to other areas within maintenance?

I have been following this community for a while, but this is my first time posting. Currently, I am tackling a project that involves developing a program to monitor the diagnostic data on multiple Stratix switches. Many essential parameters, such as temperature and MAC addresses, can only be accessed through explicit messaging. Each parameter is defined by class/instance/attribute information in the EDS file, making message configuration straightforward.\n\nHowever, the sheer volume of parameters to monitor presents a significant challenge. Setting up separate messages for each parameter, especially when some parameters apply to every port on the switch, is a daunting task. While configuring messages for one switch is feasible, repeating this process for every switch the program needs to monitor is impractical.\n\nIdeally, I envision creating an Add-On Instruction (AOI) that handles messaging internally. Since the message class, instance, and attribute are consistent for a given parameter across all switches, the AOI would simply require a switch reference to output the specific parameters for that switch. This would involve developing the AOI, duplicating it for each switch on a new rung, adjusting the reference accordingly, and completing the task.\n\nHowever, based on my own experimentation and the information gathered from various forum discussions, implementing messaging within an AOI seems challenging. If I were required to configure each message externally in the routine where the AOI is called, it would defeat the purpose of streamlining the process.\n\nI am currently using version 32 of Logix and working with an L85. I am hopeful that there have been advancements or changes since the older forum posts I have consulted, which could potentially make my desired solution achievable.

When I first started learning PLC programming, an electrician gave me some valuable advice: minimize the use of OTL (latch) and OTU (un-latch) instructions. While I was more familiar with languages like C, Pascal, and Fortran, I found latch and un-latch instructions easier to use at the time, much to the electrician's dismay.\n\nFrom the electrician's perspective, using an OTE (coil) and latching it with a branch and a normally open contact was more intuitive. However, using multiple latch and un-latch instructions on the same bit can result in confusing and convoluted code. It often seems like a quick fix rather than a well-thought-out solution.\n\nLet's examine the OTE instruction, which turns a referenced bit on when certain conditions are met and off otherwise. However, if the processor is switched between Run and Program modes, the status bit can be lost, causing issues in certain situations.\n\nTo address this issue, the STE instruction was developed. Similar to the OTE instruction, the STE instruction can survive a processor mode switch. By following certain rules, such as only referencing a status bit in one STE instruction per program, you can ensure that your logic is clear and concise.\n\nThe STE instruction also allows for triggering events based on signal edges. It contains three signals: PT (point), LE (leading edge), and TE (trailing edge), which provide additional functionality and flexibility in programming.\n\nBy implementing the STE instruction in RSLogix 5000, you can simplify your programming and ensure the reliability of your logic.

After conducting extensive research on various forums and blogs, it appears that the 1794-VHSC module is not popular among users. I encountered some issues myself while using this module to count pulses from a flow meter. Initially, I was unsure if I needed the module or if a digital input would suffice. Luckily, the flow meter offers a scalable pulse output feature, which I have set to 100:1.\n\nMy inquiry consists of two parts. Firstly, does anyone have information on the correct wiring for this module? I managed to get it to count on the A input, although the manual indicates that the A indicator should be flashing. After discussing with a colleague, we connected 0V to the A- terminal, which resolved the issue. However, we noticed that the pulses were rising even when there was no flow, and the count exceeded 1000 pulses after reaching the target. The manual specifies that the A and A_ inputs are 24V, possibly intended for an encoder (with which I have limited experience). Do I need a 0V reference for the card to function properly?\n\nSecondly, has anyone encountered faults with this module? It worked flawlessly for several days before suddenly starting to flash (not to be confused with the 1794-AENTR module). Despite checking the power supply, ensuring it was not in PROG mode, and verifying network connections, status bits like Status.1 and Status.15 were set to one. The flashing module prevented pulse capture, with no active filters and a rollover set to 16777215. The PLC in use is the 1769-L30, housed in a rack containing an AENTR, digital input/output modules, analog input module, and the VHSC module.\n\nOverall, it seems like a configuration issue is at play, but I'm unsure of the exact cause.

Upon disassembling the bearing assembly hub, it was clear why the mill had stopped working. However, I am seeking to understand the root cause of the bearing failure depicted in the images. The hub comprises three bearings: two nu316 cylindrical roller bearings and one qj316 deep groove ball bearing with a split inner race. The hub is situated vertically, with one bearing at the top and two at the pulley end, with the ball bearing at the bottom. The mill runs at a speed of 2600rpm and is powered by a 75kw belt-driven motor. It appears that the outer race has been rotating within the housing, potentially due to previous sleeving, causing the ball bearings to impact the inner race and generate enough heat to deform it. Any insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, we had accelerometers attached to the bearing housing and took readings three days prior to the failure, which did not show any defects or increased stress levels.

In my dataset, which consists of 233 positive integers ranging from 0 to 20160, I am trying to identify the smallest non-zero value, which I will refer to as Ntarget. One way I have managed to accomplish this is by using rungs 100 and 101 to generate integers and insert them into the array A_Start_Compare[...]. These integers range from -20160 to +20160, but I am specifically interested in the positive integers. Rung 102 helps eliminate the negative integers using a GRT. Ideally, I would like to simply subtract the integer from B_Next_Water[0] and then use SRT. However, the issue arises when the generated numbers after GRT fall between 0 and +20160. My goal is to pinpoint the smallest non-zero number (Ntarget), which can be located anywhere in the array.\n\nTo achieve this, I realized I need to position the desired number at either the top (B_Next_Water[232]) or bottom (B_Next_Water[0]) of the SRT so that I can easily reference its exact array position. To accomplish this, I initially manipulate Ntarget by making it the largest number through subtraction from +20160.

Here's the background story: I acquired a 1769-L33ERMS from a previous owner who intended to use it for production but opted for a more budget-friendly PLC instead. This PLC was operating on the V36 firmware, a version unfamiliar to the machines on the production floor or to many of us. Upon receiving it, I made the decision to downgrade its firmware to V35, a known stable version that is compatible with multiple machines using Logix.\n\nThe downgrade process appeared successful with all blocks downloaded and the log showing a successful update. However, when ControlFlash attempted the power cycle sequence and \"poll on powerup\" response, the PLC failed to restart and displayed solid red lights. Without wanting to incur additional costs, I decided to explore the internal components and discovered a hidden button on the board near the mode switch. Pressing this button during powerup triggered a series of power cycles indicated by the LEDs, eventually bringing the controller back online.\n\nDespite this success, the PLC now experiences a safety task fault every time it is power cycled, specifically Type 14 code 07: Safety Task Inoperable fault, resulting in a program dump. Only a complete re-download of the program resolves this issue. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods including downloading different programs tailored for this controller and version, creating a new program specifically for the L33ERMS running V35, power cycling the controller in different switch modes, enabling time synchronization, and adjusting the Safety Task scan period.\n\nHowever, all these efforts yield the same outcome. I am open to suggestions or solutions to address this persistent fault. While another firmware change may be considered as a potential next step, I am cautious due to previous challenges encountered.

For example, if two events occur closely together, such as explosions, only one announcement will be made. However, if different events occur within a short timeframe, like an explosion followed by a flood, both will be announced in order of occurrence.\n\nThe anticipated locust infestation is scheduled for later, and it will be a single event that still requires notification. Due to the use of a serial control device with an ETH I/P gateway, there may be a delay between sending a command and receiving a response. Therefore, the logic implemented must account for this delay.\n\nBefore allowing the activation of a message playback function or manipulating the stack, the device must be checked for its busy status. Despite this, the stack should still be able to receive additional values as they come in.\n\nThe process described could benefit from a Raspberry Pi or Arduino with CIP Ethernet capabilities. However, there may not be support for this protocol in that context, and there may not be time to learn a new technology at the moment.\n\nTo interact with the HMS serial/IP Gateway, certain procedures must be followed, such as incrementing a trigger byte before sending or receiving data. The player itself is more straightforward and responds to single ASCII characters, but due to the serial nature of communication, the mentioned incrementation is necessary.\n\nWhile the device can play messages by manipulating bits and values within the PLC, there seems to be a challenge with queuing the messages for playback. Some assistance with example code for implementing a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue is sought to overcome this hurdle.\n\nIn this system, certain defines are used to manage codes and statuses, such as [IncomingCode], [CheckForBusy], [EvaluationTag], and [BusyFlag]. The FIFO pair (STACK) operates efficiently for holding new codes while the player is occupied, but integrating it into the overall process is the current obstacle.\n\nThe provided pseudocode outlines the flow of operations, including checking for incoming codes, monitoring the player's status, and handling the playback of messages. This flow ensures the proper handling and playback of messages based on the system's status and conditions.","replies_count":23,"page_name":"creating-a-queue-function-support-for-managing-messages-in-a-sequential-system","post_date":"01-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting Ice Delivery System Issue with Danfoss VLT FC001 3kW VFDs","user_name":"Itrim","content":"Hello, I am experiencing an issue with the ice delivery system after transitioning from contactor to VFD control using Danfoss VLT FC001 3kW VFDs to regulate 3-phase asynchronous 2.2kW motors driving augers and scrapers.

Specifically, I am seeking information on the following: MB_ADDR, MODE, DATA_ADDR, and DATA_LEN for the VFD.\n\nI have referred to the \"MOVILINK Protocol_Modbus RS485\" documentation (https://x0.at/pYY7.pdf), but I am grappling with determining the suitable addresses for these actions and whether they are bits or HEX registers. Additionally, I have included screenshots of my ladder diagrams to provide a better understanding of the current configuration.\n\nHave you had any experience in configuring and overseeing SEW EURODRIVE motors via Modbus RS485 using Siemens PLCs? Any advice or perspectives on this matter would be highly valued. Thank you in advance for your assistance.","replies_count":5,"page_name":"configuring-sew-eurodrive-motor-with-modbus-rs485-on-siemens-s7-1200-plc","post_date":"21-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting Intermittent Communication Issues Between VFD and Controller","user_name":"EmpireShallRise","content":"For the past month, I have been experiencing frequent communication faults between my Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) and Controller (5069-L320ERS2).

Last August, we upgraded our community water system with a Franklin Electric Subdrive ConnectPlus, serving 27 homes for various purposes including home use and outdoor lawn watering during the summer. The system features a 7.5 hp motor located at 60 feet in a 218 ft well. Previously, we had a traditional setup with a 60-40 contact switch. We were informed that the pump would adjust its speed based on demand. During startup, the system reaches a maximum of 60hz with a 19.8 amp draw, then maintains a range of 53-58 hz with an 18.3-18.8 amp draw under normal use. The pump never fully ramps down when idle, only resting when reaching the higher end of the spectrum for a short period. The VFD is currently set at 60-50psi. \n\nMy concern is whether the system should slow down during low demand and shut off at that point, rather than at the higher end. Could the transducer being located in the pumphouse instead of the pressure tank house be causing the system to linger on the high end without slowing down? During periods of low demand, it would be expected for the motor speed to drop to the low 40s with amperage levels around 14-16. At present, the only noticeable advantage of the system is the soft start feature, as it behaves similar to a traditional setup.","replies_count":5,"page_name":"optimizing-vfd-settings-for-community-water-system-wells","post_date":"31-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"The Difference Between Reworking and Revisiting: Clear Explanation Needed.","user_name":"John Reeve","content":"I recently came across these terms on a forum and am seeking a clear explanation or difference between the two.

The Series A controller had firmware version 20 installed, and the program was loaded onto the SD card along with the option to load both the program and firmware upon power up. When we inserted the SD card into the Series B controller and powered it up, the process failed, leaving the Series B controller in a nonfunctioning state. Subsequently, we converted the program offline in Studio 5000 to firmware version 31.\n\nAny endeavor to download the program to the Series B controller initiates a firmware upgrade from the factory 1.x version. Unfortunately, all attempts to upgrade the firmware have resulted in failure, displaying the message \"Manually Reset module.\" Even using ControlFlash and ControlFlashPLUS have yielded the same outcome.\n\nWhile I was able to adjust the Series B controller's IP address using BOOTP and RSLinx, these actions do not seem to be related to updating the firmware or downloading the program. Is there a way to reset the Series B controller or restore it to a functioning state where the firmware can be updated and the program can be downloaded?\n\nI have come across suggestions of creating an SD card in a separate Series B controller with the correct firmware, but these discussions have not provided a definitive solution. I hope to avoid permanently damaging the Series B controller by inadvertently using an SD card with incompatible firmware. Although the controller bears a warning sticker regarding the risk of programming issues with wrong firmware, it is puzzling why the process of loading the wrong firmware onto the SD card did not simply fail, instead of leaving the controller inoperable.","replies_count":10,"page_name":"troubleshooting-series-a-b-firmware-problems-with-compactlogix-1769-qbfc1b-controller","post_date":"14-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Intermittent Issue: Simatic ET200SP DI Module Triggering Line Stop Alarm without Physical Button Press","user_name":"athidi006","content":"We are currently experiencing intermittent issues with the emergency stop and line stop at our facility.

I am becoming more comfortable with the S7-300 PLC. In the meantime, I have completed a course on TIA for a new machine featuring S7-1500 and I am impressed with the capabilities of the TIA portal. However, I am facing challenges with my S7-300 PLCs. I am seeking guidance on creating logic to generate a pulse every half-second based on accumulated time. In Rockwell systems, there is a retentive timer that holds the accumulated value when the input (enable) toggles on and off, and resets the cumulative value to zero with a timer reset. I have experimented with various timers in the S7-300, but have not found a suitable solution. How can a logic rung be set up to achieve this? How can a pulse be triggered for every 500 milliseconds of accumulated value? I am open to utilizing a combination of timers, counters, adders, and other functions, but I am struggling to implement this without complex coding.

Since the Red Lion only supports word-size blocks, I created a data block starting at 400100 with a length of 4 words. \n\nMy question is whether the start inventory command (either 1 or 2) should be placed in the 0th bit of register 400100 and the Handshake value in bit 8 of the same register. Alternatively, should the entire 400100 register (16 bits, 1 word, 2 bytes) hold the Inventory command and the Handshake be located in register 400101? \n\nI have tried various combinations, even setting the start register to 400099 and 400101, as it seems the Red Lion shifts registers by 1 due to zero-based indexing.

I hope this request aligns with forum guidelines, as I have seen a similar inquiry regarding DC motor windings. The issue at hand involves an electric aircraft tug previously manufactured by JetPorter, which is now under the ownership of Tronair. Unfortunately, the technical data from the original manufacturer has been lost. The equipment operates on a hydraulic system with a pump and a pump controller that were replaced by a previous mechanic, resulting in the pump malfunctioning. The Curtis-made pump controller has 4 terminals (B+, B-, M-, & A2) for power distribution, while the motor has 2 terminals (T1 marked D1E1 and T2 marked A2E2). It is evident that the current motor is not suitable for the 72-volt system as it is labeled for 48 volts. Before acquiring a new motor, it is crucial to determine the correct winding configuration. It is assumed the new motor should be a 3-wire, unidirectional motor wired to B+, M-, and A2 on the speed controller outputs. When connected to B+ and A2, the speed controller does not activate the motor but does provide 59 volts to open the ground path on M-. Any guidance on the proper winding for this motor would be greatly appreciated, as the equipment's functionality is vital for airport operations.

I recently bought a Schneider M241 PLC for a new product line we're developing. It's affordable and programmed using CODESYS (also known as Schneider Machine Expert). While waiting for the PLC to arrive, I started working on the program and encountered a significant issue related to reading data from a Modbus TCP slave device. The device uses discrete, holding, and input registers that need to be accessed using Modbus function codes 02, 03, and 04. \n\nI followed online guides to set up the Slave device by adding a 'Generic Modbus TCP Slave Device' to the Industrial Ethernet Manager. However, when trying to define the Modbus TCP Channel Configuration, I noticed that I only have options for function codes 03, 04, and 23. I did some research and found that this may be consistent with Schneider's documentation for the M241 Modbus Master Mode. \n\nAfter further investigation, it seems like only function code 03 is supported for scheduled scanning of Modbus TCP slaves. This limitation is surprising, as the M241 is capable of supporting a wider range of function codes when set up as a Modbus TCP Server (Slave). It's puzzling that function codes 2 and 4 are accepted in slave mode but not when operating as a master.\n\nI would appreciate any insights or solutions to this issue, as it's a crucial requirement for our system.

This is my first time posting, and I consider myself a novice in this field. I am encountering a crucial issue where my servo/linear piston is not correctly zeroed, causing a discrepancy between the actual physical position (47 mm) and the perceived position in Studio 5000 V35 (32 mm). This discrepancy poses a significant risk of mechanical damage.\n\nThe equipment involved includes an A2198-C1004-ERS KINETIX 5300 servo driving an MPAIA3076RM14AMP series heavy-duty electric cylinder with a total range of 76 mm. The feedback and power/brake cables are new (2090-CPBM7DF-16AA033 m Power/Brake & 2090-CFBM7DF-CEAA033 m Feedback), and other hardware includes a 5069-L306ERM CompactLogix and a 2711P-T7C22D8S PanelView Plus 7.\n\nThe piston controls the spacing of grind wheels, with soft limits set at 32mm and 58mm, and a home position at 34 mm. The HMI provides specific recipes for selected positions that the servo should reach and hold with a brake until a different recipe is chosen.\n\nWhile initial programming tests were successful manually, I am now facing difficulties automating functions like moving to the home position or selected recipe locations. I have attempted to rezero the drive/piston but have encountered limitations within the controller tags.\n\nI am seeking advice on how to restore/rezero my drive/piston alignment and prevent such issues in the future. Is there a way to avoid errors caused by code or power cycles? Am I misunderstanding absolute encoding and its ability to track position accurately?\n\nAdditionally, I am considering adding limit switches for extra protection and would appreciate recommendations on sensor types and homing sequence tips. My goal is to achieve precision within 0.1 mm tolerance without introducing errors from sensor resolution.\n\nThank you in advance for any guidance or insights you can provide.\nWarm regards,OhNo!","replies_count":9,"page_name":"troubleshooting-misalignment-issues-with-kinetix-5300-electric-cylinder-how-to-re-center-and-avoid-future-errors","post_date":"09-10-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Effective Key Performance Indicators for Maintenance and Reliability Engineers","user_name":"khairol shukri","content":"In order to effectively measure the performance of Maintenance Engineers and Reliability Engineers, it is important to establish specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each group.

Even with effective Preventive Maintenance strategies and advanced software in place, it is impossible to capture all failures. Failures can be categorized into three patterns: Infant Mortality, Random Failures, and Wear or age-related failures. Understanding these failure patterns is crucial in developing a comprehensive maintenance structure that can effectively address a majority of failures. \n\nPreventive Maintenance focuses on age-related component failures and infant mortality failures, which only account for around 20% of equipment failures. In industries with automated equipment and electronic components like semiconductors, the most common failures are random in nature, making them harder to predict and prevent. This highlights the limitations of Preventive Maintenance in capturing random failures, prompting the need for alternative strategies like predictive maintenance, run to fail, or modification. \n\nTo address the various types of failures effectively, a well-rounded maintenance strategy should be implemented, capturing wear out, age-related, random, and infant mortality failures.

I delved into the world of PLC programming about a year ago, mainly working with GE/Emerson products such as RX3i and 90/30. To kickstart my journey, I attended an entry-level programming class offered by Emerson and received invaluable guidance from experienced programmers at my workplace. Our primary task involves using PLC controllers to test automotive seat frames. Each controller houses multiple versions of the same logic, which we refer to as stations (e.g., station 1, station 2). \n\nRecently, I encountered an issue where I had to duplicate an existing functional logic, adjust it for a new sheet, and assign specific variables to correspond with the station number. However, during this process, I observed that certain registers in the new logic were displaying \"1.#INF.\" According to a colleague, this anomaly might be caused by division by zero. Despite looking through the Analog Logic, Output Logic, and Test Logic sections, I couldn't pinpoint where the division by zero occurred. Is there a more efficient way to identify this zero division without manually checking every rung?\n\nI attempted to share a screenshot for better clarity, but encountered some technical difficulties.

Originating from Japan, TPM has its unique approach which may not necessarily be directly applicable to every industry. Many industries struggle with implementing TPM due to common pitfalls and challenges. Before diving into a TPM strategy, it is crucial to consider the following key factors to ensure success:\n\n1. Align TPM Goals with Company Objectives: Ensuring that the TPM goals are in line with the company's overall objectives is essential for a smooth implementation process.\n2. Establish a Dedicated TPM Office: Assign a team of full-time staff overseen by a dedicated manager to lead the TPM implementation process.\n3. Involve Managers in Pilot Machines: Designate a \"Manager's Model Machine\" as per JIPM requirements and involve managers in the TPM process.\n4. Allocate Budget for TPM: Understand that TPM implementation can be costly, especially during the initial stages, due to necessary restoration and correction activities.\n5. Emphasize Documentation: Ensure that all team members understand the importance of documentation, displaying it prominently on bulletin boards for easy access.\n6. Showcase Success Stories: Highlight successful TPM implementations to gain support from top management and boost morale within the team.\n7. Prioritize Management Commitment: Instead of mere support, secure full commitment from top management to drive the TPM implementation effectively.\n8. Provide Training: Training is crucial for all team members, especially management, to kickstart TPM activities successfully.\n9. Adopt a Top-Down Approach: TPM implementation should start from the top leadership level and cascade downwards for effective results.\n\nRemember, TPM is a powerful strategy that requires careful planning and dedication to succeed.

This control is executed through G-code for motion commands and M functions for toggling the nozzles on/off.\n\nThe main challenge I am encountering is achieving precise synchronization between the motion of the nozzles and their activation/deactivation, particularly considering the inherent delay in the hardware's response time. At present, the nozzles are moving at a speed of 500 mm/s, with the PLC system functioning at a cycle time of 1 ms. This configuration limits the system's accuracy to about 0.5 mm, directly related to the PLC's cycle time.\n\nGiven these limitations, I am considering whether switching to a dedicated controller with a faster cycle time could be a viable solution. I would greatly appreciate your input on the following queries:\n\n- Viability: Is adopting a dedicated controller with a faster cycle time a feasible method to improve accuracy in this context? Have you implemented a similar solution in your own practice?\n- Recommendations: If a dedicated controller is recommended, are there specific models or brands that suit these criteria well? Keep in mind there are 24 individual nozzles in the array.\n- Alternatives: Alternatively, are there other methods or technologies you would propose exploring to tackle the synchronization and accuracy issues without necessitating a switch to a different controller?\n\nI am eager to hear your opinions, experiences, and any guidance you can offer on enhancing the efficiency of such a system.

To address this, I leveraged the $ADDRESS variable within the object's parameter definition, ultimately streamlining the OPC address building process.\n\nRegarding graphics, we craft Class templates for independent utilization. However, issues arise when attempting to incorporate these templates into other graphics, particularly involving embedded classes. Despite setting the $OBJECT parameter and ensuring its public status, complications arise when handling composite members within graphic templates.\n\nIn conclusion, despite my efforts to address these challenges through scripting, the documentation's limitations hinder progress. If any readers have successfully navigated similar hurdles involving embedded classes and graphics in Cimplicity 2022, I welcome any insights or solutions you may offer. It is my hope that this discussion resonates with others who have encountered comparable obstacles.","replies_count":4,"page_name":"optimizing-cimplicity-2022-overcoming-challenges-with-graphics-and-embedded-classes","post_date":"21-10-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Start the New Year Right: Resetting Your Work Order Numbering System","user_name":"Donal Fleming","content":"Many MP2 users opt to incorporate the last two digits of the year into their Work Order numbers, such as with an example like 14-0012345. However, resetting this numbering system on January 1st is a task that is often overlooked. If you currently use the year as a prefix for your work order numbers, now is the ideal time to plan for a reset. To do so, navigate to Tools > Setup > Work Orders. A dialog box will open, allowing you to adjust the prefix for your Work Order numbers. It is highly recommended to test this change by creating a few work orders to ensure compatibility with the existing formats in the Work Order and Work Order History modules. Additionally, this is an opportunity to streamline data entry by removing leading zeros from the work order number. For instance, you could update the format to 15-12345. It is also worth considering removing the year reference altogether (e.g. 012345) and using the Request date to track when a Work Order was issued. Remember to test any changes you make by creating test work orders. Wishing you a successful and prosperous new year. Regards, Donal Fleming, Fleming Technical, Inc.

I am facing difficulties in organizing my program for MODBUS RTU communication between my s7-1200 master and 4 slaves, where I need to read the same registers from each slave. To tackle this, I have divided the registers into 2 groups. For example:\nGroup 1 includes registers 4001, 4003, and 4005\nGroup 2 includes registers 4221, 4223, and 4225\n\nThe data from all groups is stored in the same DB, but with different addresses.

In the second and third networks, I utilize FB \"MB_MASTER_DB\" to read data from Group 1 and Group 2, respectively.\n\nNow, expanding this approach to the second slave, which has the same groups as the first slave, poses a few questions. Should I create a new instance data block for \"MB_MASTER_DB\" for the second slave, or can I simply use a new instance of the FB \"MB_MASTER_DB\" like when adding a new group of registers to the same slave? Additionally, besides changing the MB_ADDR, what other considerations should be taken into account?\n\nIt is important to ensure that the FB \"MB_MASTER_DB\" for Group 2 of Slave No. 1 is not called until the FB for Group 1 of the same slave has completed without errors.

However, we are now facing activation issues as our laptops are not able to activate using the server. A message indicates that the server needs to be on version 5.00 or higher. Despite the need for an update, our IT department is reluctant to update the server, citing concerns that our plant's 'legacy' equipment may not be compatible with the newer version. In the past, I have successfully had them update the server for the same reason without any issues. I fail to see any potential issues that may arise from upgrading the server from v4.xx to v5.xx. Does anyone have any insights on this matter?

The customer's setup includes a DC motor running at 10 RPM, connected to a shaft with a notch. A Keyence fibre optic unit is positioned to detect when light passes through the notch as the shaft rotates. The Keyence unit outputs an analog signal based on the amount of light passing through the notch. The goal is to stop the motor when the Keyence unit reaches its peak voltage output.\n\nThe customer prefers to use the \"peak\" voltage rather than a preset number, as external factors such as light values or dirt may cause variations in the set value. Therefore, the motor should be stopped when the Keyence unit reaches the highest voltage for that specific rotation. Your assistance in solving this challenge would be greatly appreciated.

I have successfully established a connection in TIA Portal with a Carlo Gavazzi EM26-96 energy analyzer using Modbus RTU protocol. My main goal is to retrieve the total kWh data, which is located at modicon address 300063 according to the manual. In the MB_Master client, I have been using address 400064 after several attempts, and it seems to be the correct address.\n\nHowever, I am encountering a discrepancy between the values displayed on the EM screen and in TIA Portal. Despite this, I have created a simple code to calculate hourly kWh using the data fetched from TIA, yielding approximately 40 kWh/hr. On the other hand, the EM screen displays a value of around 103 kWh/hr.\n\nI have noticed that when I use certain addresses, such as 400002 for V L1 and 400004 for V L2, everything seems to align properly. However, address 400006 does not provide V L3 as expected but instead shows V L1-L2. This discrepancy leads me to suspect that there may be a misalignment in the V L numbers.\n\nAdditionally, the values for kWh (+) L3 remain stagnant and have not incremented for the past two weeks, unlike L1 and L2 which continue to increase. Moreover, the kWh total and kWh partial addresses show identical values, which raises some concerns.\n\nCould the DMD functionality and phase configurations of the energy analyzer be influencing the data interpretation in TIA Portal?

Despite receiving feedback beeps when interacting with the HMI, the buttons do not change colors to indicate functionality. Is there a connection between the ethernet port and HMI control over the PLC system? The HMI is connected to the PLC via a serial cable, and while the system accepts the input override pin, pressing buttons on the HMI does not trigger any action.\n\nConsidering the HMI's connection to a hub, which in turn connects to the ethernet port on the first rack, I suspect the issue may lie with the faulty ethernet port.

I am seeking assistance as I am facing difficulties in identifying the root cause of the issue or any factors that may have been overlooked. The problem at hand involves a centrifugal water pump comprised of a Paco Pump (CL25123) with one stage, and a Teco AEHL-WG motor (90Kw, 460V, 3570 RPM) with a disc coupling. The symptoms include high directional vibration, particularly in the horizontal direction on the pump, with a dominant 2xrpm, 4hv-1358%, and 3hv-171.7%. \n\nPreliminary actions taken to address the issue included alignment checks and corrections, as well as shaft deflection checks which showed 0.05 deflection on both the impeller and coupling side shaft ends. Housing tolerances and eccentricity were also inspected and rectified as needed. Additionally, pipe stress and alignment were assessed and deemed acceptable.\n\nFurther investigations are now focused on the potential Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks. During the initial inspection, it was noted that the pump base bolts were not penetrating the baseplate flooring. Attempts were made to replace them with longer bolts, but it was discovered that the base flooring holes were tapered, preventing the longer bolts from fitting properly. By manually measuring the total height of the pump feet thickness and base bolt plate thickness to ensure proper engagement with the base plate, it was determined that the original bolts should be retained. \n\nObservations were also made regarding corrosion on the base frame, although its impact on vibration remains uncertain as the base plate and anchor bolts are still secure. Vibration measurements on the discharge elbow pipe showed 9mm/s.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\n------------------------------\nLuis Eugene Tibre \n------------------------------","replies_count":13,"page_name":"identifying-and-addressing-high-horizontal-vibration-in-centrifugal-water-pump-root-cause-analysis-and-solutions","post_date":"03-11-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Efficiently Adding Spanish Translations in FactoryTalk View Studio","user_name":"JasonWade","content":"I am currently using Machine Edition release number 5 to develop a multilingual application in English and Spanish.

It's important to note that without knowing the pressure range, it can be challenging to accurately interpret the transducer's readings.","replies_count":8,"page_name":"how-to-determine-pressure-range-for-a-0-5-v-pressure-transducer-on-a-machine","post_date":"28-08-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Troubleshooting Studio 5000 TON Timers and FOR Loop in Structured Text (ST)","user_name":"musterhere","content":"Hello, I'm fairly new to working with Rockwell PLCs and I'm currently attempting to execute the following code snippet.

Despite my background in sensor technology, I lack experience in maintenance. My main task involves analyzing downtime records, which primarily stem from machine breakdowns, as well as potential issues like water leaks and pump noises. The company's maintenance routine consists of daily visual inspections by operators and periodic maintenance by a small team of maintenance personnel.\n\nTo address this challenge, I plan to classify equipment based on manufacturer, type, and operational status. I will calculate Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for similar equipment to establish appropriate maintenance intervals. Additionally, I intend to utilize Pareto analysis to identify the top 20% of equipment responsible for 80% of downtime, and apply Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to prioritize critical failure modes for daily inspections.\n\nHowever, I am unsure about devising a comprehensive periodic maintenance schedule solely based on MTBF, as failure occurrence is unpredictable. While some suggest using the P-F curve method, determining the P-F interval requires monitoring each machine's failure modes, which is not feasible due to limited resources and a short internship duration.\n\nConsidering these constraints, I believe focusing on enhancing daily inspection tasks, such as training operators in visual inspections and incorporating critical failures into their routines, is a practical approach.

To guarantee the accuracy of RCM analyses for devising cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical and complex systems or equipment, what specific steps, measures, or quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) plans should be implemented?\n\nThe topic of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a contentious one that often sparks debate among industry professionals. In a recent meeting focused on designing a reliability and maintenance conference, opinions on RCM were divided. While some advocated for its inclusion as a case study, others expressed skepticism about its effectiveness. The reluctance to include RCM in the conference agenda reflects a growing disillusionment with the methodology among practitioners.\n\nAlthough RCM has its merits in certain contexts, such as early equipment design and complex manufacturing systems, its applicability to the majority of manufacturing systems is questionable. Many industry experts argue that standard maintenance practices can yield similar results to RCM analyses without the exorbitant time and cost investments. The theory of failure distribution and time for failures to progress to breakdowns, a key component of RCM, has been utilized successfully by professionals for decades.\n\nThe ineffectiveness of RCM analyses was highlighted in a case study of a plant in Europe where extensive resources were dedicated to RCM initiatives. Despite the meticulous documentation and comprehensive reports produced by cross-functional teams, the recommendations yielded were largely redundant and impractical. Maintenance tasks were scheduled infrequently, took unnecessarily long to execute, and failed to align with industry best practices.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the Predictive Maintenance group revealed that they were already performing the recommended actions at optimal frequencies, rendering the RCM recommendations redundant. This revelation underscored the need for a critical reevaluation of RCM practices and a recommitment to proven maintenance strategies to ensure operational efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, the efficacy of RCM analyses must be scrutinized to avoid falling into the trap of prioritizing flashy reports over practical outcomes. By focusing on upgrading existing systems, technologies, and operator training, organizations can achieve tangible results with minimal effort. Share your thoughts on RCM and the quest for real, impactful results with minimal investment.

I have recently taken charge of a Building Management System that has not been performing up to par since its installation. The system consists of a ControlLogix main unit with wireless communication to a Micro820 unit located on each roof. The Micro820 units are equipped with temperature sensors, which enable them to control fans and activate heating or cooling stages as needed for each unit. \n\nAfter successfully establishing communication and initial control functions, my focus has shifted to optimizing the control of multiple cooling or heating stages. The current setup has a five-minute delay between stages, but I am seeking more advanced and efficient control methods. \n\nAs someone with limited experience in HVAC control outside of this particular project, I am curious about how a professional Building Management System handles stage control. Unfortunately, I have not come across typical or exemplary control algorithms in my research online. \n\nBased on my understanding, I believe that utilizing fewer stages for longer durations is generally more energy-efficient compared to shorter cycles with more stages. This will be my primary objective, unless I discover more effective approaches through further research. \n\nI have started by monitoring the performance of a non-VFD AC unit and have observed that one cooling stage was adequate until the temperature rose significantly in the afternoon. By activating a second stage, I was able to quickly achieve the desired temperature before the compressors cycled off. \n\nI have also identified some potential issues with the temperature probes and will address them accordingly. In terms of control logic, I have devised a preliminary plan that involves enabling additional stages after a delay if the temperature deviates from the setpoint beyond the hysteresis range. I am considering implementing a timeout feature to activate another stage if the temperature remains stable but does not reach the cutoff point.\n\nFor units equipped with VFDs for heating and/or cooling, I am exploring specific strategies to optimize their performance. It may be beneficial to establish a minimum speed requirement that adjusts according to the number of stages in operation.\n\nAt this stage, my focus has been on cooling operations, with plans to address heating functionalities as the colder months approach. I welcome any insights or suggestions from experienced individuals in this field.

I also considered utilizing a COP instruction, which works efficiently for individual words but falls short when dealing with 3 words. I attempted to create an array of words, transform my non-concurrent words into a concurrent format, and then use the COP function to transfer them into the UDT structure. Unfortunately, COP rejected being assigned to the header of the array instead of a direct array address.\n\nIs there a method or technique that I have overlooked in accomplishing this task efficiently in AB programming?","replies_count":13,"page_name":"efficient-data-handling-in-ab-logix5000-with-ladder-logic-and-user-defined-data-types","post_date":"08-11-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"How to Integrate Bacnet Data into Aveva Plant Scada for Monitoring and Interpretation","user_name":"Aimin Ariff","content":"Hello everyone, I am seeking assistance as this is a new task for me.

We recently purchased a copy of Citect 7.20 along with a complimentary license key (600 points). The problem we're facing is that the SCADA software Citect crashes and becomes unresponsive after approximately 15 hours of operation. This issue has been ongoing since the software was first installed and started running.\n\nThe PLC we are using is a SIMATIC ET-200S (6ES7151-8AB00-0AB0), and the communication between the SCADA and the PLC is facilitated through the OPC server SimaticNET 2008 Edition. Originally, Citect was installed on a computer running Windows 7 Professional. However, due to the persistent problems, we switched to a new PC with Windows XP Professional in an attempt to rule out any system-related errors. Unfortunately, the issue persisted even after the change. We also attempted to resolve the problem by installing SP2, but it did not solve the issue.\n\nOur project utilizes a single trend server and an alarm server, and there are no custom scripts added aside from those used for calling popup trends or changing pages. The error report from the Windows Event Viewer indicates that the faulting application is Citect32.exe (version 7.20.0.598), with the faulting module being KERNELBASE.dll (version 6.1.7601.17514). The exception code is 0xe0434f4d.\n\nI have attached one of the exception reports generated by Citect for reference. Any insights or suggestions on why this issue may be occurring would be greatly appreciated, as the support from Schneider Electric Bulgaria has not been able to provide a solution. I have also reached out to Schneider Electric Global for assistance and I am awaiting a response.

In an effort to reduce beat frequency, we have set every other fan to operate at different speeds - 1080 and 980 RPM. The problem arises when the fans change direction from clockwise to counterclockwise during operation. This switch in direction results in a significant increase in vibration levels, reaching up to 1.04 ips in the axial direction and 0.8 ips in one of the radial directions. Additionally, there are impacts observed in both axial and radial directions, with a Crest Factor of up to 7.4 Gs.\n\nThe fan vendor suggests that the issue is structural, possibly due to a resonance problem, based on past experiences. However, no additional testing has been conducted to support this claim. Unfortunately, we are unable to perform further testing until January when the furnace will be taken down. I am puzzled by the vendor's explanation of a resonance problem as the high 1X vibration and Crest Factor trends suggest otherwise.\n\nDetails about the bearings being Link Belt P363 and belt driven are also worth mentioning. My queries are as follows:\n\n- Can resonance cause an impact at 1X running speed in the axial direction?\n- Why does the vibration spike significantly when only three or four fans change rotational direction?\n- Is this issue primarily structural or related to balance/mechanical factors?\n\nThank you for your insights and assistance.

I am currently facing an issue with my HMI connected to 2 PLCs via ethernet. These PLCs are controlling 2 systems within a single machine. The problem arises when the sensor readings on the HMI start freezing intermittently. Restarting the PLC resolves the issue temporarily. The PLC in question is connected to 3 sensors (4-20mA), and the readings from these sensors become abnormal during the freezing issue.

However, the author only provides MTBF and desired availability, leaving the formula for calculating failure finding interval (FFI) - inspection interval - questionable. This approach has two major flaws: 1. Failure causes are grouped together when calculating MTBF, making it unlikely to have a distribution. 2.

Asset breakdowns can significantly impact businesses, with critical assets being prioritized based on potential shutdown or safety risks. However, just assigning rankings may not be enough, and technical justification using methods like RCM, RBI, or IPF may require external expertise. Effectively allocating maintenance budgets is crucial for safe and reliable operation, with data-driven decisions based on equipment failures or histories. Deferred maintenance can lead to unplanned overhauls or replacements, with statutory requirements like fitness certificates imposing limitations on turnaround intervals. The 'right' maintenance budget is often calculated as a percentage of the plant's CRV, per industry benchmarks. Determining an asset's end of life depends on proper maintenance and replacements, as static equipment can last indefinitely. Showing the strategic value of asset management may be evident during critical incidents or through key performance indicators. Looking towards the next generation of asset management, a risk-based approach can help organizations make more informed decisions to optimize asset strategies and prevent costly breakdowns. Aging infrastructure, loss of experience, lack of competency, changing employee expectations, and management control issues are key risk drivers that necessitate a new approach to asset management aligned with organizational goals. This shift will require a cultural change, recognizing the importance of people in successful asset management programs alongside advancements in technology. Embracing and addressing human factors such as change management, training, recruitment, and leadership will be paramount in achieving sustainable performance improvements in asset management practices. The next generation of asset management will focus on integrating technology to enable and institutionalize these practices within organizations. To learn more about current asset management trends and the future outlook, watch the video presentation on \"Asset Management: The Next Generation\" for insights on achieving optimal asset management strategies through a risk-based approach.","replies_count":1,"page_name":"optimizing-asset-management-strategies-a-risk-based-approach-for-the-future","post_date":"23-11-2024","equipment_type":"general equipment"},{"title":"Do I Need to Rewind My Air Conditioner Blower Motor for Better Performance?","user_name":"joshua suring","content":"Do I need to rewind my 4 hp air conditioner blower motor with a dual-sided fan?

As an educator at a local college, I have always appreciated the valuable insights provided by this community. Today, I am reaching out for your expertise once more, particularly in the realm of mechatronics. While I am well-versed in working with stepper and servo motors, my knowledge of AC motor control, especially at higher voltages, is limited. Ensuring the safety of my students during lab sessions is my top priority.\n\nThe training setups utilized by my students feature VFDs, motor starters, relays, and 3-phase motors within cabinets. Students collaborate in pairs to construct circuits based on schematics I provide, with tests only conducted under my supervision. Our lab operates on 208V three-phase power, with grounded enclosures, disconnect switches, and LOTO procedures in place for added safety measures.\n\nDespite these precautions, troubleshooting poses challenges. Ideally, students would be more hands-on in this process, but due to safety concerns, working on live cabinets is not feasible. Additionally, there are instances where I must use a meter to check voltages within circuits.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, I have a few inquiries:\n- Would it be advisable for me to wear electrical gloves when probing live circuits?\n- Is it safe for students to adjust VFD parameters directly on the control panel, considering the live components involved? Are there alternative practices we should consider?\n- I welcome any safety recommendations based on the visual depiction of our lab setup.\n\nYour ongoing support and guidance have been immensely valuable to me as an educator.

While I have created a model that appears to be working effectively thus far, it is crucial to validate it with real-world data. I would greatly appreciate input from fellow professionals in this field. I have extensively studied Moubray's writings on this subject and have incorporated much of his terminology into my work. However, I still have questions regarding how to calculate the availability of protective devices and the associated costs per unit of time.\n\nLet's consider the following scenario: a pump with a protected function experiences unanticipated failures every 1,000 hours, while the protective device (which is not fail-safe) fails following a Weibull distribution with parameters of Shape = 4 and Scale = 2,000 hours. The time required to repair or replace the protective device is negligible for simplicity's sake in this example. Inspections are conducted every 200 hours, with each inspection costing €100. The estimated cost of failure consequences is €10,000.\n\nDuring simulation iterations, various results are obtained. For instance, the protected function may fail before the protective device, or vice versa. It is essential to analyze these outcomes to understand the interaction between the two components. Calculating the availability of the protective device and evaluating the costs associated with inspections and potential failures are key aspects to consider.\n\nBy running the simulator for 5,000 iterations, valuable insights have been gained. Without inspections, the probability of multiple failures is 0.1822, with an average availability of the protective device at 93.86%, leading to a mean total cost per iteration of €1,810. On the other hand, with inspections performed every 200 hours, the probability of multiple failures decreases to 0.0162, resulting in an average availability of 98.84% and a mean total cost per iteration of €537. These findings highlight the importance of inspections in reducing costs and enhancing device availability.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that inspections yield significant benefits in this scenario. Continuously evaluating the frequency of inspections to optimize costs and device performance is essential. I welcome any feedback or recommendations for improving this methodology. Additionally, if you are aware of relevant resources or literature on this topic, please feel free to share. Thank you for your insights.

The system is integrated with a SLC500 processor, and the drives are controlled via device net, with the latest addition being the Powerflex 525 installed just yesterday. The Powerflex is controlled using a 2-wire setup.\n\nDuring operation, I have observed that when I raise the hoist while it is empty, it stops precisely as intended, with the frequency decreasing to zero as indicated on the faceplate. However, when I lower the hoist, I notice the frequency fluctuating between 2.0 and 2.5 Hz, causing the hoist to drift downwards until an F007 fault (\"Motor Overload\") occurs on the drive.\n\nThe parameters currently set are as follows:\n- P033: 7.6\n- P034: 7.6\n- P036: 1768\n- P037: 4.03\n- P041: 2.0\n- P042: 1.0\n- P043: 0\n- P044: 100\n- P045: 0\n- P046: 2\n- P047: 7\n- P048: 2\n- P049: 7\n- P062: 48\n- P063: 49\n- P064: 0\n- P065: 7\n- P066: 7\n- P067: 13\n- P068: 11\n- P411: 12\n- P412: 45\n- P442: 2.0\n- P443: 0.5\n\nIt is worth mentioning that I have incorporated a brake resistor and configured it in the parameters for dynamic braking.\n\nIf anyone has insights or suggestions on what might be causing this issue, I would greatly appreciate your input.

This goal is derived from achieving a Plant operational Reliability of 99.1% and Availability of 94%, taking into account past experiences of failures and inspection interventions. It is crucial that we meet this target. \n\nUpon further analysis, this operational target is dependent on the reliability and availability of various sub-units, all the way down to the individual components within those sub-units. The management has set these targets based on demand and supply, but factors such as machine aging, life cycle, repetitive inspection interventions (specifically for gas turbines), and degradation of other components may pose challenges in achieving the target.\n\nWe aim to establish a benchmark for the expected reliability of the turbines, based on past and present system and component reliability data. This will allow us to determine if the Plant reliability and availability targets are reasonable. I am seeking best practices and benchmarking procedures within the industry for units such as turbines, pumps, and compressors, categorized by power output (1 MW, 5 MW, 10 MW).

The corporate landscape is experiencing a noticeable increase in awareness regarding the importance of effective asset management, with integrated enterprise asset management systems evolving as part of comprehensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) suites that streamline all organizational functions like finance, HR, and supply chain management.\n\nTraditionally, businesses favored specialized \"best of breed\" applications for asset management due to their superior features, functionality, and usability. However, the gap between integrated suites and best of breed tools is narrowing as technology advances. These industry developments prompted us to gather insights from various experts and compile a report to delve deeper into these trends. While some contributors may have biases towards specific vendors, it's essential to use your judgment when evaluating the information presented.\n\nOur goal with the Reliability Roadmap series is to offer a neutral perspective, devoid of vendor influence, to aid businesses in their quest for reliable asset management solutions.
