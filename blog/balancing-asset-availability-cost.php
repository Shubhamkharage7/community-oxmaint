            <section class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Balancing asset availability with cost reduction is a critical concern in industrial maintenance. While maximizing asset availability ensures consistent productivity, cost reduction strategies keep the operations economical. Achieving this balance requires a comprehensive approach, integrating thoughtfully planned maintenance practices, use of advanced tools, and adherence to safety standards.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Asset Availability?</h2>
                <p>Asset availability refers to the duration an asset remains operational and capable of performing its intended function. High asset availability is crucial for maintaining production schedules and meeting business goals. It is typically measured as a percentage calculated by dividing the uptime by the total planned production time.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Balance Asset Availability and Cost?</h2>
                <p>While it is tempting to focus solely on either maximizing availability or minimizing costs, an imbalanced approach can lead to inefficiencies:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Excess Costs</strong>: Overemphasis on availability might result in excessive maintenance expenses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Downtime</strong>: Overemphasis on cost-cutting could lead to inadequate maintenance, increasing downtime and reducing productivity.</li>
                  </ul>
                A balanced approach optimizes asset performance while maintaining economic sustainability.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct Effective Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Effective maintenance involves systematic planning, monitoring, and execution. Here are essential steps to consider:
                  <ol>
                    <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Regularly inspect assets to identify potential issues early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Planning</strong>: Develop a maintenance schedule that incorporates both preventive and predictive maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Execution</strong>: Implement maintenance tasks using skilled technicians and optimized procedures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Use automated systems to monitor asset performance continuously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review</strong>: Periodically review maintenance outcomes and adjust strategies based on data insights.</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="mb-6">
                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>The timing of maintenance activities can significantly impact asset availability and costs. Ideally, maintenance should be conducted:
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Preventively</strong>: Scheduled maintenance based on a predetermined timeline or usage metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictively</strong>: Maintenance based on real-time data and analytics that predict equipment failure before it occurs.</li>
                  </ul>
                Both approaches can help avoid unexpected breakdowns and prolong asset life.</p>
