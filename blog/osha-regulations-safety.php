                <h2 class="text-primary">What are OSHA Regulations?</h2>
                <p>OSHA regulations establish mandatory standards for health and safety in the workplace.

This not only protects employees but also saves companies from costly fines, litigation, and reputational damage. Implementing effective safety protocols also boosts employee morale and productivity.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct an Industrial Inspection</h2>
