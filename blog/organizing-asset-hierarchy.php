                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify and Categorize Assets:</strong>
                        <p>Start by listing all assets and categorizing them based on their type, function, and criticality. Use standard naming conventions for consistency.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Define Hierarchical Levels:</strong>
                        <p>Establish different levels in the hierarchy such as system, subsystem, component, and part. Ensure that higher levels summarize the assets below them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Assign Relationships:</strong>
                        <p>Link assets within the hierarchy to depict their relationships and dependencies. This helps in understanding the flow and impact within the system.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Utilize Asset Management Software:</strong>
