            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the world of industrial maintenance, two primary methodologies dominate the field: Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Understanding their differences, benefits, and application scenarios can significantly impact the efficiency and reliability of your machinery and infrastructure.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Preventive Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Preventive Maintenance involves regular, planned maintenance activities aimed at preventing unexpected equipment failures. It includes routine inspections, adjustments, parts replacements, and cleaning operations. The goal is to detect and fix issues before they cause equipment breakdowns.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Conduct Preventive Maintenance?</h3>
                <p>Preventive Maintenance aims to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce downtime</li>
                    <li>Extend equipment lifespan</li>
                    <li>Enhance safety</li>
                    <li>Maintain optimal performance</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Conduct Preventive Maintenance?</h3>
                <p>Implementing an effective PM program typically involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating a maintenance schedule based on equipment manufacturer's recommendations</li>
                    <li>Regularly updating and adjusting the schedule based on operational data</li>
                    <li>Ensuring all maintenance tasks are documented</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Reliability-Centered Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a structured method to determine the maintenance needs of physical assets in their operating context. It aims to ensure that systems continue to do what users require in their present operating conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Conduct Reliability-Centered Maintenance?</h3>
                <p>RCM focuses on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying and prioritizing the most significant failure modes</li>
                    <li>Optimizing maintenance practices to ensure reliability and performance</li>
                    <li>Balancing the cost of maintenance with the cost of failure</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Conduct Reliability-Centered Maintenance?</h3>
                <p>Key steps in implementing RCM include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying critical assets and functions</li>
                    <li>Determining failure modes and their effects</li>
                    <li>Developing maintenance strategies that mitigate these failures</li>
                    <li>Implementing, monitoring, and continuously improving maintenance plans</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Use Which Approach?</h2>
                <p>The choice between PM and RCM depends on various factors, including equipment criticality, failure consequences, and available resources. Here's a guideline to help you decide:</p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">Opt for Preventive Maintenance when:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equipment is relatively inexpensive and non-critical</li>
                    <li>Failure shows clear wear patterns that can be anticipated</li>
                    <li>Regular, simple maintenance can prevent failures</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="text-primary">Opt for Reliability-Centered Maintenance when:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equipment is critical to operations</li>
                    <li>Failure has severe consequences on safety, environment, or operations</li>
                    <li>There is a need to optimize maintenance activities for cost-effectiveness</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2 class="text-primary">FAQ</h2>
                <h3>1. What are the core differences between PM and RCM?</h3>
                <p>PM focuses on routine, scheduled maintenance regardless of equipment condition, while RCM bases maintenance tasks on the reliability and likelihood of failure of the equipment.</p>
                
                <h3>2. How often should Preventive Maintenance be conducted?</h3>
                <p>PM schedules are typically based on manufacturer recommendations or historical data about equipment performance. It could range from daily checks to annual overhauls.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Is RCM applicable for all types of equipment?</h3>
                <p>RCM is particularly beneficial for critical and complex systems where failures can have significant consequences. It might not be cost-effective for low-criticality equipment.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Can PM and RCM be used together?</h3>
                <p>Yes, a hybrid approach can be beneficial where preventive maintenance procedures are applied to less critical assets, and RCM strategies are reserved for critical equipment.</p>
                
                <h3>5. What are the main benefits of using a CMMS?</h3>
                <p>A CMMS helps streamline maintenance activities, improve compliance, reduce downtime, and extend the lifespan of assets by organizing and simplifying maintenance management.</p>
