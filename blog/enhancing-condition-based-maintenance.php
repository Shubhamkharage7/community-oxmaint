                <h1 class="text-primary display-2">Enhancing Effectiveness in Condition-Based Maintenance</h1>

                <p>Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is a proactive maintenance strategy that leverages real-time data to monitor asset conditions and determines the necessary maintenance interventions. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the what, why, how, when, needs, tools, and features of CBM, and provide you with best practices to enhance its effectiveness.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Condition-Based Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Condition-Based Maintenance involves monitoring the actual condition of an asset to decide what maintenance needs to be performed. CBM dictates that maintenance should be performed only when certain indicators show signs of decreasing performance or upcoming failure. This approach helps organizations ensure that their maintenance efforts are effective and efficient.</p>
