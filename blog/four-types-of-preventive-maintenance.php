                <div>
                    <p>Preventive maintenance is crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of industrial equipment. This comprehensive guide will explore the four main types of preventive maintenance: Predictive Maintenance, Condition-Based Maintenance, Time-Based Maintenance, and Failure-Finding Maintenance. Each type has its unique benefits, processes, and tools that cater to different maintenance needs.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">What is Preventive Maintenance?</h2>
                    <p>Preventive maintenance involves regular, planned maintenance activities like inspections, replacements, and overhauls to prevent equipment failures. The main goal is to enhance equipment life and avoid unplanned downtime.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Why Conduct Preventive Maintenance?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Increases operational efficiency:</b> Regular maintenance keeps machines running smoothly, reducing unexpected breakdowns.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduces costs:</b> Preventing failures is typically cheaper than emergency repairs.</li>
                        <li><b>Improves safety:</b> Regular inspections can identify potential safety hazards before they cause accidents.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Types of Preventive Maintenance</h2>

                    <h3 class="text-primary">1. Predictive Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Predictive maintenance relies on the actual condition of equipment to determine when maintenance should be performed. This type uses advanced technologies like vibration analysis, thermal imaging, and equipment performance data.</p>
                    <h4>Why Use Predictive Maintenance?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Minimizes maintenance costs by performing maintenance only when needed.</li>
                        <li>Reduces unplanned downtime and extends equipment lifespan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>How to Conduct Predictive Maintenance?</h4>
