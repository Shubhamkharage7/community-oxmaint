                <h2 class="h2 text-primary">What is LOTO?</h2>
                <p>Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) is a safety procedure used in industrial and research settings to ensure that dangerous machines are properly shut off and not restarted before the completion of maintenance or repair work. LOTO involves specific practices and procedures to safeguard employees from the unexpected energization or startup of machinery and equipment, or the release of hazardous energy during service or maintenance activities.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="h2 text-primary">Why is LOTO Important?</h2>
                <p>The primary importance of LOTO procedures is to protect the welfare and safety of workers. Failure to control hazardous energy accounts for nearly 10% of the serious accidents in various industries. Hence, implementing LOTO procedures not only complies with regulatory standards such as OSHA, but also significantly reduces injuries and fatalities in workplaces.</p>

                <h2 class="h2 text-primary">How to Conduct LOTO Procedures</h2>
                <p>Conducting LOTO procedures involves multiple steps. These include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparation: Identifying the sources of energy and understanding the specific hazards involved.</li>
                    <li>Shutdown: Turning off the equipment following the established procedures.</li>
                    <li>Isolation: Disconnecting or isolating the equipment from its energy sources.</li>
                    <li>Lockout/Tagout: Applying locks and tags to the energy-isolating devices.</li>
                    <li>Release Stored Energy: Releasing or restraining any stored energy in the machinery.</li>
                    <li>Verification: Ensuring the lockout/tagout process has rendered the machine safe.</li>
                </ol>
