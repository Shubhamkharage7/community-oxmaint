            <section id="introduction">
                <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of industrial production, choosing between batch and continuous processing is pivotal for maximizing production efficiency. This comprehensive guide delves into the critical aspects of both methodologies, outlining what they are, why they are essential, and how to conduct maintenance inspections to ensure optimal performance.</p>

            <section id="what">
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Batch Processing?</h2>
                <p>Batch processing involves manufacturing a product in separate and distinct groups or batches. Each batch goes through the entire production process before the next one begins. This method allows for precise control over quality and can be adjusted for small or large production runs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard features: Flexibility, Control</li>
                    <li>Common industries: Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="what-continuous">
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Continuous Processing?</h2>
                <p>Continuous processing, on the other hand, involves an ongoing production flow. Materials are continuously fed into the system, and products are produced without interruption. This method is ideal for high-volume, consistent product outputs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard features: Efficiency, High output</li>
                    <li>Common industries: Chemical Manufacturing, Oil Refining</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="why">
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Choose One Over the Other?</h2>
                <p>The choice between batch and continuous processing depends on various factors including product type, scale of production, and specific industry requirements. Batch processing offers more flexibility and is ideal for products that require varying formulations, while continuous processing is efficient for products that need consistent quality and high output.</p>
