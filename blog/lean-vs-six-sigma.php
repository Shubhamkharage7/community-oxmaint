                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Lean?</h2>
                <p>Lean is a systematic method for waste minimization within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity. Lean also takes into account waste created through overburden and unevenness in workloads. Its focus is on enhancing customer value by improving processes and eliminating waste.</p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">Key Principles of Lean</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Value: Identifying what is valuable to the customer.</li>
                    <li>Value Stream: Mapping out all the steps in the value stream.</li>
                    <li>Flow: Ensuring a smooth flow of processes.</li>
                    <li>Pull: Producing only what is needed.</li>
                    <li>Perfection: Continually improving processes.</li>

                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Six Sigma?</h2>
                <p>Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement, which seeks to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization.</p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">The DMAIC Cycle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define: Identify the problem and what is required to satisfy customers.</li>
                    <li>Measure: Collect data and determine how well the process is performing.</li>
                    <li>Analyze: Identify the cause of defects and opportunities for improvement.</li>
                    <li>Improve: Implement solutions to reduce defects and improve process performance.</li>
                    <li>Control: Maintain the improvements made.</li>
