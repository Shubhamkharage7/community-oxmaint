            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
                <p>Industrial maintenance is a critical aspect of ensuring the efficiency and longevity of machinery and equipment in varied sectors. Agile methodologies are increasingly being integrated into maintenance strategies to optimize processes and enhance performance. Two predominant Agile methodologies—Iteration-Based Agile and Flow-Based Agile—offer distinct benefits and application approaches. This article delves into their comparison, providing insights into the best practices for incorporating these methodologies into industrial maintenance routines.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Iteration-Based Agile?</h2>
                <p>Iteration-Based Agile, often referred to as Scrum, is a methodology that structures work in time-boxed iterations, commonly known as sprints. Each sprint is usually between 1 to 4 weeks long and aims to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.</p>
