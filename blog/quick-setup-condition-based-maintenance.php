                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Condition-Based Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) is a proactive maintenance strategy that monitors the actual condition of an asset to decide what maintenance needs to be done. It aims to conduct maintenance only when evidence of decreasing performance or potential failure is detected.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Condition-Based Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Implementing CBM helps in reducing downtime, extending equipment life, improving safety, and optimizing resources. Its importance lies in its capacity to perform maintenance actions based on real-time data, ensuring efficient operations and cost savings.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Condition-Based Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Schedule CBM based on asset-specific indicators. Regular monitoring intervals depend on the nature of the asset and the criticality of its operations. Optimal times include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After noticing performance deviations.</li>
                    <li>Following significant operational events.</li>
                    <li>During scheduled operational downtimes.</li>
                </ul>
