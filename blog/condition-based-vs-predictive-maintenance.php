                <h2 class="text-primary h3">What is Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)?</h2>
                <p>Condition-Based Maintenance, commonly referred to as CBM, is a maintenance strategy where monitoring equipment conditions forms the basis of maintenance decisions. By evaluating real-time data, you can determine when maintenance is needed instead of following a predetermined schedule.</p>
