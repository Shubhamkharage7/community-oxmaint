            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is HACCP?</h2>
                <p>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety that addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards. This methodology identifies critical control points (CCPs) in the food production process to ensure the final product's safety. By focusing on prevention rather than end-product testing, HACCP aims to ensure food safety from the very beginning of the production process.</p>
            </section>
