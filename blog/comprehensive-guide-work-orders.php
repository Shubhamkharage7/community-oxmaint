                <h2 class="text-primary">What is a Work Order?</h2>
                <p>At its core, a work order is a document that outlines maintenance tasks to be completed, the necessary resources, and the timeline. Work orders serve as a roadmap for maintenance activities ensuring everything is completed efficiently and effectively.</p>
            
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Are Work Orders Important?</h2>
                <p>Work orders streamline the process of scheduling and executing maintenance tasks. They ensure that all necessary information is communicated, resources are allocated, and timelines are adhered to. This reduces downtime and increases the reliability of equipment and facilities.</p>
            
                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct a Work Order?</h2>
