                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Planned Maintenance Percentage (PMP)?</h2>
                <p>The Planned Maintenance Percentage (PMP) is a critical metric used in industrial maintenance to gauge the efficiency and effectiveness of the maintenance strategies deployed. In essence, PMP measures the ratio of planned maintenance activities to the total maintenance activities (both planned and unplanned) over a specific period of time. A higher PMP signifies a proactive approach to maintenance, reducing unexpected downtimes and extending the life span of machinery and equipment.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Why is PMP Important?</h2>
                <p>PMP serves several pivotal roles within industrial settings, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Reliability:</strong> Regular, planned maintenance boosts the reliability of machinery, preventing unexpected failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Preventive maintenance reduces expensive emergency repairs and minimizes downtime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer Equipment Lifespan:</strong> Properly maintained machines tend to last longer, offering better returns on investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Compliance:</strong> Regular maintenance ensures that equipment adheres to safety standards, mitigating risks to personnel.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct PMP Calculations?</h2>
                <p>To calculate the Planned Maintenance Percentage, use the following formula:</p>
                <p><code>PMP = (Planned Maintenance Hours / Total Maintenance Hours) * 100%</code></p>
                <p>For example, if a factory has 80 hours of planned maintenance and 20 hours of unplanned maintenance in a given month, the PMP would be:</p>
                <p><code>PMP = (80 / (80 + 20)) * 100 = 80%</code></p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Determining the optimal schedule for maintenance depends on various factors, including the type of machinery, operational demands, and manufacturer recommendations. Typically, maintenance schedules can be divided into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> For high-use, critical machinery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> For medium-use, non-critical equipment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> For low-use or highly reliable machines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Yearly:</strong> Comprehensive checks and overhauls of all equipment.</li>
                </ul>
