            <h1 class="text-primary display-2">What Is Manufacturing Overhead?</h1>
            <p class="lead">Manufacturing overhead encompasses all the indirect costs involved in the production process. It includes expenses that are not directly tied to a specific product but essential for smooth operations. These include costs such as factory rent, utilities, depreciation, and salaries of non-production staff.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Understanding Manufacturing Overhead</h2>
            <p>Manufacturing overhead, often known as factory overhead or indirect manufacturing costs, plays a critical role in determining product pricing and profit margins. Understanding these costs is pivotal for effective cost management and optimizing production efficiency.</p>

            <h3 class="text-primary">Why Manufacturing Overhead Matters</h3>
            <p>Accurately calculating manufacturing overhead is essential for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining the total cost of production.</li>
                <li>Setting appropriate product pricing strategies.</li>
                <li>Identifying areas for cost reduction.</li>
                <li>Ensuring accurate financial reporting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-primary">Components of Manufacturing Overhead</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Indirect labor (supervisors, maintenance staff).</li>
                <li>Indirect materials (tools, cleaning supplies).</li>
                <li>Utilities (electricity, water).</li>
                <li>Factory rent and depreciation.</li>
                <li>Repairs and maintenance.</li>
                <li>Factory administration costs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">How to Calculate Manufacturing Overhead</h2>
            <p>To calculate manufacturing overhead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sum all indirect costs over a specific period.</li>
                <li>Allocate these costs to products based on a chosen allocation base, such as direct labor hours or machine hours.</li>
                <li>Use the formula: <em>Manufacturing Overhead Rate = Total Indirect Costs / Total Allocation Base</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">When to Review Manufacturing Overhead</h2>
            <p>Regular review of manufacturing overhead is crucial. Conduct reviews:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly or quarterly to keep track of any significant changes in cost.</li>
                <li>When budgeting or forecasting for new projects.</li>
                <li>During financial audits and annual reporting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Need for Effective Manufacturing Overhead Management</h2>
