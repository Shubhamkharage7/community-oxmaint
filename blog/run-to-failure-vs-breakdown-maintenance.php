            <section>
                <p>In the world of industrial maintenance, two prominent strategies often come up for discussion: run-to-failure (RTF) and breakdown maintenance. Both approaches have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these can help organizations select the maintenance strategy best suited to their operational needs.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Run-to-Failure Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Run-to-failure maintenance strategy involves letting equipment run until it fails. Only when the failure occurs is the equipment repaired or replaced. This approach is often applied to non-critical assets, where downtime doesnâ€™t significantly impact operations.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Breakdown Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Breakdown maintenance, on the other hand, involves reacting to breakdowns. Similar to RTF, this strategy delays maintenance until a failure occurs. However, breakdown maintenance is applied to critical as well as non-critical equipment and is typically unscheduled.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Conduct These Maintenance Strategies?</h2>
                <p>Both strategies aim to optimize operational efficiency and equipment lifespan. They are typically chosen based on the criticality of equipment, cost implications, and operational requirements.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct RTF and Breakdown Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Implementation revolves around setting clear protocols:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify equipment type and criticality.</li>
                    <li>Define failure thresholds and indicators.</li>
                    <li>Prepare contingency plans for unexpected failures.</li>
                    <li>Train maintenance staff on troubleshooting and quick fixes.</li>
                    <li>Monitor and document failure histories for future reference.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct These Strategies?</h2>
                <p>Both RTF and breakdown maintenance are conducted after equipment has failed. The decision of when to apply these strategies should consider factors like operational impact, safety, and cost.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Need for RTF and Breakdown Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Industrial operations often require continuous functionality. RTF and breakdown maintenance can optimize costs and ensure critical operations have the least disruptions.</p>
            </section>
