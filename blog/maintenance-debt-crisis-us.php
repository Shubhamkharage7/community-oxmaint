                <h2 class="text-primary">The What and Why of Maintenance Debt</h2>
                <p>Maintenance debt refers to the backlog of deferred maintenance tasks that accumulate over time due to various factors such as budget cuts, resource constraints, and lack of proactive planning. The longer maintenance tasks are delayed, the more severe and costly the repairs become, leading to increased downtime and compromised safety.</p>
                <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increased Operational Costs:</strong> Delays in maintenance often lead to more extensive repairs, inflating operational costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Risks:</strong> Deferred maintenance can result in hazardous conditions, posing risks to workers and other personnel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Productivity Loss:</strong> Unplanned downtime due to failures can disrupt workflows and decrease productivity.</li>
                </ul>
