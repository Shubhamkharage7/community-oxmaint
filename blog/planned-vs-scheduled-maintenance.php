            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section>
                <p>Understanding the differences between planned and scheduled maintenance is vital in optimizing the lifespan and performance of industrial equipment. Whether youâ€™re in charge of a large-scale manufacturing plant or a small workshop, proper maintenance strategies can save you from costly downtime and prolong the life of your assets. Let's delve into what distinguishes planned maintenance from scheduled maintenance and how you can implement best practices for both.

            <!-- What is Planned Maintenance? -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Planned Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Planned maintenance refers to maintenance tasks that are prepared and organized upfront based on anticipated requirements. These tasks are designed to prevent equipment failures before they happen, ensuring that machinery remains operational and efficient. Planned maintenance includes routine inspections, part replacements, and equipment upgrades.</p>

            <!-- What is Scheduled Maintenance? -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Scheduled Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Scheduled maintenance involves executing maintenance tasks based on a predefined schedule, which could be time-based (every week, month, or quarter) or usage-based (after certain hours of operation). The key objective is to perform maintenance at regular intervals, mitigating the risks of unexpected breakdowns.</p>
