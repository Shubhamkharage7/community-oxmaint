                <p>TPM implementation involves eight pillars:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Autonomous Maintenance</li>
                    <li>Planned Maintenance</li>
                    <li>Focused Improvement</li>
                    <li>Early Equipment Management</li>
                    <li>Quality Maintenance</li>
                    <li>Education and Training</li>
                    <li>Administrative Improvements</li>
                    <li>Safety, Health, and Environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each pillar has specific objectives and activities that contribute to the overall success of the TPM program. A systematic approach includes training, regular evaluations, and ongoing adjustments based on performance data.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct TPM?</h2>
                <p>TPM should be an ongoing, evolving process rather than a one-time initiative. Regular assessments and continuous improvement activities are key to maintaining equipment efficiency and overall operational performance. Depending on the specific requirements of your operation, TPM activities can be conducted weekly, monthly, or quarterly.</p>
