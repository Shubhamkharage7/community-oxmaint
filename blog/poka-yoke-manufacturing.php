                <p>Poka-Yoke, a Japanese term meaning "mistake-proofing" or "inadvertent error prevention," is a methodology aimed at eliminating defects in manufacturing products. It involves integrating simple, usually physical, mechanisms into the production process to prevent errors and ensure quality and efficiency. This approach is part of the broader lean manufacturing and continuous improvement strategies.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Poka-Yoke?</h2>
                <p>Poka-Yoke was coined by Shigeo Shingo, a Japanese engineer who helped develop the Toyota Production System. It involves designing processes in a way that prevents human errors from occurring or at least makes them immediately noticeable so they can be corrected before resulting in defects. The ultimate goal is zero defects.</p>
