                <p>Effective problem solving is at the heart of successful maintenance operations. The Fishbone Diagram, also known as the Ishikawa Diagram or Cause and Effect Diagram, is a visual tool that can be used to systematically identify and analyze the root causes of problems in maintenance.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">What is a Fishbone Diagram?</h2>
                    <p>A Fishbone Diagram is a graphical representation that resembles the skeleton of a fish, with the problem represented at the ‘head’ and the causes extending to the ‘bones’. This tool is particularly useful for identifying potential factors causing an issue in a structured way, allowing for thorough analysis and effective problem-solving.</p>
