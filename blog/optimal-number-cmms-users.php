                <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the optimal number of CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System) users is crucial for the successful implementation and utilization of the system. This directly impacts the efficiency of maintenance activities, productivity, and cost management.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">What is CMMS?</h3>
                <p>
                    A CMMS is a software that centralizes maintenance information and facilitates the processes associated with the lifecycle of equipment. It helps maintenance professionals track work orders, manage assets, and plan maintenance schedules efficiently.

                <h2 class="text-primary">Top 5 FAQs</h2>
                <h3 class="text-primary">1. What is the ideal number of users for a CMMS?</h3>
                <p>
                    The ideal number varies with the size and complexity of operations, usually determined through a needs assessment.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">2. How can I assess the right number of users?</h3>
                <p>
                    Evaluate your maintenance workload, asset count, and define roles clearly within your CMMS.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">3. How often should I review user roles in a CMMS?</h3>
                <p>
                    Regular reviews every 6-12 months or after significant changes in operations are advisable.
                </p>
