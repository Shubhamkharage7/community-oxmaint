            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Process Validation?</h2>
                <p>
                    Process validation refers to the collection and evaluation of data, from the process design stage through production, to establish scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality products. It verifies that the process does what it purports to do.

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Process Verification?</h2>
                <p>
                    Process verification is the confirmation, through objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled. It is typically conducted after validation and is a continuous assessment that ensures the process remains effective during routine production.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why are They Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Both process validation and verification are critical for regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and operational efficiency. They help in identifying potential issues before they affect the final product, thereby minimizing risks and ensuring that customer requirements are met consistently.

                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct These Processes</h2>
                <p>
                    Process validation should be conducted before the process is fully operational to confirm its capability. On the other hand, process verification is an ongoing activity that takes place during regular production cycles to ensure continued compliance and effectiveness.
