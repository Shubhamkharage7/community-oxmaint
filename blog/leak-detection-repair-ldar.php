                <h2 class="text-primary">What is LDAR?</h2>
                <p>Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) is a vital program implemented in industries to identify and repair leaking components, such as valves, pumps, compressors, pipes, and connectors. This program aims to reduce the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other harmful emissions into the environment, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and promoting workplace safety.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Why is LDAR Important?</h2>
                <ul>
