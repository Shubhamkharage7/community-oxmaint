                <p>
                    An asset in the context of industrial maintenance is any equipment, machinery, or physical property that has value and is critical for the operations of a business.
                    Assets can be tangible, such as manufacturing equipment, or intangible, such as software licenses.

                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Asset Management is Important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Proper asset management ensures that assets operate at their peak efficiency, which in turn minimizes downtime, reduces operational costs, and extends the lifespan of the equipment.
                    It also ensures compliance with safety regulations and can significantly impact the overall productivity and profitability of a business.

                    Here's a breakdown of these processes:
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-primary">1. Inventory Tracking</h3>

                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Asset Management?</h2>
                <p>
                    Asset management should be an ongoing process, with routine inspections and maintenance activities scheduled based on the asset's operational hours and conditions.
                    Reactive maintenance should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as it often leads to longer downtimes and higher costs.
