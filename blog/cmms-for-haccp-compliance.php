                <h1 class="text-primary display-2">Why CMMS is Crucial for HACCP Compliance</h1>
                <p>In the food processing industry, ensuring food safety is paramount. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) compliance is an indispensable component of operational protocols. Incorporating a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) can significantly enhance the ability to comply with HACCP requirements.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">What is HACCP?</h2>
                <p>HACCP is a systematic preventive approach to food safety that addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards as a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">What is CMMS?</h2>
                <p>A CMMS is a software designed to monitor, plan, track, and streamline maintenance tasks. It serves as a centralized database for all maintenance-related information, thereby enhancing productivity and ensuring compliance.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Why CMMS is Crucial for HACCP Compliance</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automates scheduling of essential maintenance tasks.</li>
                    <li>Maintains comprehensive records that aid in regulatory compliance.</li>
                    <li>Improves the reliability and performance of equipment by preventing breakdowns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-primary">How CMMS Helps in Conducting HACCP Compliant Maintenance</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automated Scheduling: Ensures that maintenance tasks are conducted without fail by scheduling them automatically.</li>
                    <li>Audit Trails: Maintains logs of all maintenance activities, aiding in transparent audits.</li>
                    <li>Preventive Maintenance: Reduces equipment failures by conducting regular maintenance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Maintenance should be conducted at regularly scheduled intervals and as required by the condition of equipment to ensure no unexpected breakdowns occur that may compromise food safety.</p>

                <h2 class="text-primary">Tools Used in CMMS for HACCP Compliance</h2>
                <ul>
