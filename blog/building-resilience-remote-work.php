            <h1 class="text-primary display-2">Building Resilience with Remote Work and Improved Health & Safety</h1>
            <p class="lead">In today's dynamic and challenging work environment, resilience is essential for ensuring continued productivity, safety, and well-being. Remote work, coupled with improved health and safety measures, stands as a robust strategy to build this resilience. This guide walks you through the importance, methods, and best practices for integrating remote work and robust health & safety protocols into your maintenance routines.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is Remote Work in Maintenance?</h2>
            <p>Remote work in maintenance refers to utilizing digital tools and technologies to perform maintenance tasks, inspections, and safety protocols without being physically present on-site. This approach not only ensures continuous operation but also minimizes risk by reducing physical interactions.</p>
