      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) are fundamental components in the lifecycle of industrial inspection, safety, and maintenance. Effective PM strategies help avoid unexpected machinery breakdowns, optimize operational efficiency, and ensure industrial safety. On the other hand, FMEA is a systematic approach to identify and address potential failures within a system, thus mitigating risks and preventing accidents.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">What is Preventive Maintenance (PM)?</h2>
        <p>Preventive Maintenance refers to the process of regularly inspecting, servicing, and replacing parts and materials of industrial equipment to prevent unexpected failures and downtimes. It involves scheduled maintenance tasks that keep machinery running efficiently and extends their lifespan.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">What is Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)?</h2>
        <p>FMEA is a structured methodology aimed at identifying and addressing potential failures in a system, design, or process. By analyzing failure modes and their impact, FMEA helps in formulating preventive measures to eliminate or minimize the causes of failures, thereby improving safety and reliability.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">Why Conduct PM and FMEA?</h2>
        <p>Conducting PM and FMEA ensures that industrial equipment functions as intended, minimizes downtimes, and enhances operational safety and efficiency. Together, they help in predicting potential issues before they arise, providing a safer working environment and reducing maintenance costs over the long term.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct PM and FMEA?</h2>
        <h3 class="text-primary">Steps to Conduct PM:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Regularly inspect equipment and document findings.</li>
          <li>Service machinery based on predefined schedules.</li>
          <li>Replace parts and materials before they fail.</li>
          <li>Maintain detailed records of all maintenance activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-primary">Steps to Conduct FMEA:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify all components within the system.</li>
          <li>Analyze each component for potential failure modes.</li>
          <li>Evaluate the impact of each failure mode on system performance.</li>
          <li>Prioritize failures based on severity and likelihood.</li>
          <li>Develop and implement corrective actions to mitigate risks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct PM and FMEA?</h2>
        <p>PM should be conducted at regular intervals according to the manufacturer's guidelines or industry best practices. FMEA, on the other hand, should be conducted whenever a new system is designed, an existing system is modified, or after a major failure or incident occurs.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">Tools Used in PM and FMEA</h2>
        <p>Various tools and software can assist in PM and FMEA processes. Some popular tools include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System)</li>
          <li>Predictive Maintenance Sensors</li>
          <li>Root Cause Analysis Tools</li>
          <li>Risk Management Software</li>
          <li>Inspection Checklists</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-primary">Features of an Effective PM and FMEA Program</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Comprehensive documentation for all maintenance activities.</li>
          <li>Regular training for maintenance personnel.</li>
          <li>Integration of predictive analytics.</li>
          <li>Periodic review and update of PM and FMEA procedures.</li>
          <li>Collaboration between different departments for continuous improvement.</li>
        </ul>
