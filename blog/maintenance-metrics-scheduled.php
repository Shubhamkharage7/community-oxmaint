            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">What is Scheduled Maintenance?</h2>
                <p>Scheduled maintenance refers to any maintenance activity that is planned and performed on a regular basis to prevent unexpected equipment failures and reduce downtime. This can include inspections, preventive measures, repairs, and replacements carried out at predetermined intervals.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Why Scheduled Maintenance is Crucial</h2>
                <p>Scheduled maintenance is vital for several reasons. It ensures the long-term reliability and efficiency of equipment, helps in managing workloads effectively, minimizes downtime, and ultimately reduces the overall maintenance costs. By routinely performing scheduled maintenance, companies can avoid unplanned malfunctions and ensure the optimal performance of their assets.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">How to Conduct Scheduled Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Conducting scheduled maintenance involves several steps: planning, scheduling, executing, and documenting. During the planning phase, determine what needs maintenance and when it should be done. Then, schedule the tasks to avoid disruption of regular operations. Execution involves actually performing the maintenance activities. Finally, document everything to ensure traceability and to inform future maintenance activities.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">When to Conduct Scheduled Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Scheduled maintenance should be conducted at regular intervals, which can be determined based on the manufacturer’s recommendations, usage patterns, and historical performance data of the equipment. For instance, some equipment might need maintenance every month, while others may only require it annually.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-primary">Tools for Scheduled Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Various tools can assist in the effective execution of scheduled maintenance. These include Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) like Oxmaint, which help in tracking, scheduling, and documenting maintenance activities. Other tools consist of maintenance checklists, inspection forms, and predictive maintenance software.</p>
