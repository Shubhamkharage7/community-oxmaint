            <p>Investing in software systems can help businesses determine the necessary spare parts to keep in stock and how many of each to store. One such system is the Spares Optimisation System (SOS), which streamlines inventory management. Check out more information about SOS at http://www.strategicorp.com/products-sos.htm. There are also other similar systems available in the market.</p>

            <p>After reviewing the website, I have come across various sources of information, including the "Standard Handbook of Plant Engineering, 2nd Edition," discussing the important topic of Identifying Necessary Spares. The consensus seems to be that there is no precise scientific method for determining which spare parts should be kept in the Maintenance stockroom. Factors such as equipment experience, manufacturer recommendations, and the process's reliance on equipment reliability all play a crucial role. My previous boss was looking for a formula that considers acquisition and inventory carrying costs against production downtime expenses when deciding whether to purchase a spare part. This formula would ultimately determine whether it is more cost-effective to buy the spare or risk waiting for it to arrive during equipment repairs. Are there any other costs or variables that should be taken into account in this decision-making process?</p>

            <p>I have utilized spreadsheet tools to consider all factors mentioned, such as acquisition, inventory carrying costs, and downtime costs. These tools were developed in-house by a team of material specialists, CMMS experts, and IT professionals to optimize inventory values and establish new ones for newly identified materials in equipment BOM. Despite the valuable data provided by CMMS materials, downtime costs are not typically included in inventory analyses. Have you classified your materials using ABC indicators based on equipment criticality levels and target availability percentages? For example, Vital A materials should be available 99% of the time, Essential B materials 97%, and General C materials 95%. Maintenance and materials teams often sign service level agreements (SLAs) as part of ISO9000 procedures. Have you engaged in material cataloging to define characteristics and equipment bills of materials (BOM)? This is crucial for categorizing materials as stock or non-stock based on various factors. For lower-priced materials, consider petty purchases if there is no established price agreement for common stock or consumable items.</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene,

It is essential to only keep spare parts in the stockroom that are prone to random failures, as these failures can happen unexpectedly. These spare parts are considered "just in case" inventory for unplanned maintenance. Other parts should be ordered "just in time" for planned maintenance purposes. If you have categorized your materials based on ABC indicators related to equipment criticality, you can utilize the discrete Poisson probability distribution to determine the optimal ordering point.

For example, if a part fails randomly once every 1,000 hours and there are 20 units of the same part running 24 hours a day, with a vendor lead time of 3 days, and a requirement for the part to be available 95% of the time, the ordering point can be calculated. By using the formula N*r*LT, where N is the number of units, r is the failure rate, and LT is the lead time, you can determine the appropriate stock level to ensure availability.

It is important to consider various iterations to find the optimal ordering point. In the given example, it was determined that ordering should be done when the stock level reaches a minimum of 4 units to meet the 95% availability requirement. Adjustments can be made based on different criticality levels to determine the most suitable ordering point.

These calculations can be easily performed using Excel with the predefined function =POISSON(k;N*r*LT;1). However, additional factors such as wear-out failure modes, preventive replacements, stockholding costs, and opportunity costs need to be considered for a more comprehensive analysis.

I hope this information is helpful for your inventory management. 

Kind regards,
Rui</p>

            <p>I have a further question that remains unclear to me: Typically, criticality is assigned to equipment before its materials. How should the mapping from equipment to its materials be done? For instance, if the equipment has a criticality rating of 1, should all of its materials be given an A indicator or a combination of ABC? What factors should be taken into account and are there any specific rules that need to be followed in this process?</p>

            <p>Hello Josh,  
This is a key outcome of the Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) methodology. The process begins with analyzing the equipment breakdown structure and systematically outlining the major functions of each component, identifying potential failure modes, their effects, and evaluating their criticality. By considering the criticality of various failure modes (taking into account factors such as detectability, probability, and severity), a decision is made to assign the appropriate ABC class.

            <p>Hello Josh, I have a unique approach in determining the criticality of random failure modes, taking into account probability, severity, and detectability. While MIL-STD-882D focuses on probability and severity, I have modified a table to incorporate detectability as well. By multiplying Detectability x Probability x Severity and assigning values based on certain ranges, I classify the criticality into Class A, B, or C. After a thorough analysis and discussion with the manager, I try to avoid stocking the remaining 20% of parts. In cases of low-cost items, adjustments may be made based on the difficulty of acquiring the parts. If needed, a more sophisticated economic analysis is conducted to consider stock holding costs and the impact of not having the part readily available after a failure. Best regards, Rui.</p>

Following your method, what are the percentages for classes A, B & C? As you mentioned: A: 99%; B: 97% and C:95%.

You frequently mention "random failure modes." Can you clarify what you mean by this? Are you referring to non-age related RCM curves? I meant "chance failures" like a puncture in a car tire.

Which items do you consider as "relatively low-cost"? Does this include capitalized spares in your strategy? I'm talking about small bearings, gaskets, lamps, and similar items. For these materials, I determine the reorder point as demonstrated in the example provided earlier. For pricey materials, my approach changes as I assess holding costs and the risk of parts shortages. Regards, Rui</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing your insights, Rui. To clarify, when I refer to % results for classes A, B, and C, I am looking at how many materials out of a total analyzed (e.g. 10,000) fall into each classification. If we have x materials classified as A, y materials classified as B, and z materials classified as C, with x+y+z equalling 10,000, we can calculate the percentage results for each class. Plotting the cost of materials against the ABC indicator on the x-axis raises questions about the resulting shape. The percentages (99%, 97%, and 95%) represent the availability of materials in the warehouse or storeroom. By the way, are you a lecturer? Your informative and detailed posts suggest a wealth of knowledge and experience.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh,

When determining the criticality of a system, it is important to establish specific ranges for detectability, probability, and severity. For example, detectability can range from 1 to 5, probability from 1 to 6, and severity from 1 to 6. By multiplying the maximum scores for each dimension (5 x 6 x 6), you can calculate the Risk Priority Number, which in this case would be 180.

In accordance with Norm Mil Std 882D, Tables A-III and A-IV, different assessment intervals correspond to percentages of 20. Class A components fall within a score range of 1 to 45, Class B components range from 46 to 81, and Class C components range from 82 to 153.

For instance, if a component has a failure behavior following an exponential distribution and scores 3 for detectability, 5 for probability, and 4 for severity, the resulting RPN would be 60. This places the component in Class B, indicating a certain level of risk acceptance.

As a professor specializing in Industrial Engineering with a background in maintenance and finance, I have a strong interest in Reliability and Maintainability. I have worked in various sectors including the Portuguese merchant navy, industrial private companies, operations management, industrial marketing, finance, and risk venture capital. Currently, I am also a consultant and trainer for companies on these subjects, while pursuing my Ph.D. in Systems Maintainability.

Thank you for your inquiry. How about you?

To address this, consider categorizing these critical components as a separate class, called "D." You may opt to avoid stocking these components altogether, opt for consignment solutions, or select a lower level of service (e.g., 90% protection against shortages). - Rui</p>

            <p>In your explanation, you have effectively illustrated how to categorize materials with ABCD indicators based on equipment criticality. Now, I am curious about the summary breakdown of these results. If I were to enlist the help of a consultant to assess all 100,000 materials in my warehouse, how many would fall under category A, B, C, or D? As a maintenance executive with a focus on reliability, I am eager to understand this breakdown. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When analyzing the 100,000 materials, the allocation of A, B, C, or D ratings will be based on the assessment of Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each specific material. This determination may vary depending on whether you analyze at the equipment level or the storeroom level. It is possible for the same material in stock to belong to different equipment with varying RPN assignments. In such cases, it is recommended to record the lowest RPN as a conservative approach.

Contrary to the popular 20-80 (Pareto) rule, the ABC technique categorizes data into classes to measure data concentration. This statistical method involves frequency analysis of a measurable property within a population. The resulting Lorenz curve or Gini index offers insight into the concentration of data, which may not always align with the 20-80 rule.

It is important to note that while the 20-80 rule might not be exact, there are instances where it closely aligns. Just like in the example provided in the attached Word document. To classify components into A, B, C, or D based on RPN, a similar approach should be taken.</p>

            <p>Certainly, I appreciate your explanation of ABC analysis. I'm curious, what criterion do you typically use in your analysis? I've come across plots based on current stock value, but I prefer to assign ABC indicators to materials based on RPN instead. It would be interesting to plot ABCD based on RPN against stock value or another relevant criterion.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, I'm delighted that you found the examples helpful. I aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of ABC analysis in materials management. I don't have a specific criterion that I always stick to - I choose the one that best suits my current organizational concerns. When it comes to RPN, I apply the ABCD analysis as previously mentioned. Keep up the good work. Regards, Rui.</p>
