            <p>Developing a maintenance strategy is crucial for the equipment and machinery in your plant. It is recommended to have a maintenance plan for each type of equipment, including static, rotating, electrical, instrument & control, and civil components. Are you currently following the original equipment manufacturer's (OEM) recommended maintenance program? If not, consider starting one as soon as possible and invite others to provide feedback and suggestions.</p>

            <p>Are you wondering why documenting a Maintenance Strategy is crucial for your operations, Batman? It is as essential as writing a school composition and is a skill we all learn early on. Take the initiative to jot down your strategy and share it for feedback. A Maintenance Strategy outlines the steps taken to preserve technical integrity, acting as a quality assurance tool to minimize downtime by up to 5%. It establishes maintenance types for equipment, including time-based maintenance, condition-based maintenance (such as vibration monitoring and oil analysis), failure finding maintenance, corrective or breakdown maintenance, and design changes. Begin by implementing OEM recommended PMs, and advance to using RCM analysis for a tailored strategy. For a top-notch lubrication strategy resource, a quick internet search will lead you to a valuable document.</p>

            <p>A Maintenance Strategy document outlines a set of tasks, their timing, and the sequence for maintaining a system or equipment. This document typically stems from an RCM, RBI, or IPF analysis on a specific system. Due to the extensive effort involved, the focus is typically on critical systems or equipment, requiring a criticality study. Through these studies, spare parts and logistic support needs can also be identified. The resulting outputs assist in developing a comprehensive maintenance plan that includes a variety of tasks tailored to match the anticipated risk levels, as mentioned by Josh.</p>

            <p>Josh, I want to outline the importance of basing criticality on a risk analysis, such as using a RAM matrix. Undertaking methods like RCM, FMECA, RBI, IPF, or Modelling provides a more thorough and accurate result. However, for those who cannot invest the time or resources required for these methods, a risk matrix approach should be utilized. Unfortunately, many organizations resort to guesswork and intuition when assigning criticality levels, leading to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the CMMS categorization.</p>
