                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have come across similar topics regarding this issue, but I have not yet found a solution. In my WinCC discrete alarm tab (refer to the attached pictures), I am unable to locate the "trigger address" even after right-clicking on the tabs to add it. Additionally, how can I determine which trigger bit corresponds to which DBx address? All my warnings are in DB51 and alarms in DB50. I am struggling to match the trigger bit with the DBx address through counting. How does a trigger bit get assigned to a specific DBx address? Is there a way to view this information? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>It has been quite some time since WinCC Flex, but from my observations, it appears that the trigger bit is positioned at an offset from the start of the tag. I suspect that if the trigger bits are of significant size, the tags may be organized as an array of bytes. To determine the new offset, one would need to refer to the Tags list to identify the starting address of the tag, and then calculate by dividing the trigger bit value by 8. This will give insight into the updated offset value.</p>

            <p>I attempted to access that feature in recent weeks, but unfortunately, it was not available. It seems like it may have been omitted from an older version, so I will verify this. However, after installing Wincc flexible advanced 2008 sp3 and sp5, I was able to locate the option I needed. Thank you for the assistance.</p>
