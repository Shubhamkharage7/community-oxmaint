                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My colleague and I have been troubleshooting a challenging issue with our Point I/O rack system. We have a setup consisting of a 1734-AENT Ethernet adapter, 5 1734-IB8S input cards, a 1734-EP24DC power supply, 3 1734-O8BS output cards, and an additional 1734-IB8S card. 
Recently, we have been experiencing dropped inputs from cards in slots 1, 2, 3, and 9 at unpredictable times. This issue is affecting various inputs, including crucial ones connected to a light curtain module. We have observed drops of about 15ms, occurring randomly. Despite our efforts to adjust the power source and configurations, the problem persists. 
After experimenting with different solutions, we found that connecting the problematic inputs directly to the +24V line of the rack somewhat resolved the issue. However, this workaround is not foolproof, as the light curtains also connect to the same +24V line and have their own outputs in the safe state. We have tried replacing the light curtains and rewiring them to the Point IO rack, but the problem persists. 
The dropped inputs are scattered throughout the machine and do not follow any specific wiring patterns. The common denominator appears to be the Point IO rack and power supply. Despite replacing parts and troubleshooting extensively, the issue remains unresolved. 
We are seeking suggestions for potential solutions to this persistent problem. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Although I am unfamiliar with this topic, I came across a helpful tech note (available to everyone) that discusses resolving flickering issues at the end of a light curtain. The tech note, QA46751, emphasizes the importance of correctly configuring the IB8S input channels for OSSD or pulse testing. Did you remember to reconfigure the input channels each time you experimented with different wiring?</p>

            <p>Do you know the date code for your IB8S module? There has been a reported issue with IB8S units causing unexpected drops of 1734 racks. You can find more information on this in the Rockwell Knowledge Base. From what I remember, the problematic modules were manufactured around 2021.</p>

            <p>Issue resolved! By utilizing an oscilloscope, we identified a 1.4VAC @ 12KHz voltage between rack 0V and ground, with pulsing peaks reaching Â±5V. This induced current was caused by two SEW Movidrives, where the ground wire was intertwined with the motor wires using a ferrite core. By separating the ground wires and re-routing them directly, the induced current decreased by 70%, resolving the problem. This solution required some mental effort, but the valuable information provided by others was greatly appreciated. Though it may not have been the exact fix this time, acquiring more knowledge is always beneficial!</p>
