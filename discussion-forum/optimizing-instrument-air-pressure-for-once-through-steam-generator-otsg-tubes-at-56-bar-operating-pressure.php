            <p>Greetings everyone, our single pass steam generator operates at a pressure of 56 Bar. We utilize Instrument air for purging the feed water lines. I am curious to find out the maximum pressure at which we can pressurize our OTSG tubes with Instrument Air. Is it safe to go up to 6 bar air pressure? Your insights are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello Guruswamy, I would like to understand the necessity of flushing the tubes. When air is used, it can become trapped in pockets within the tube layout, causing potential heat transfer issues and even tube rupture. Have you checked with the OTSG vendor for their recommendation on air flushing? It is important to consider that instrument air may contain impurities that could contaminate the water, especially at 56 barg. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully assess the risks involved. In my opinion, the air pressure should not be your primary concern in this situation.</p>

            <p>Dear Mr. Narayan,

Our plant is currently undergoing preservation procedures to ensure the longevity of our equipment. This includes regular maintenance of our Gas turbine (performing FSNL every 15 days), rotating the generator rotor by 180 degrees, and purging the OTSG tubes with Air to eliminate any moisture or water content. Please provide guidance on the best course of action.

Warm regards,
Gurusamy</p>

            <p>When considering the possibility of completely draining the OTSG, it is recommended to use air or N2 with a dew point of -40C. This gas can be obtained by evaporating liquid air or N2. Gently blow this gas through the OTSG after warming it to +20C and measure the dew point at the exit using a recorder. Initially, the dew point will be high, but it will eventually stabilize around -5C or thereabouts, indicating that the OTSG is sufficiently dry. The first drying process may take several hours or even days, depending on the configuration of the tubes and bends. It is important to maintain the OTSG under dry air or N2 at a pressure of about 50mm water. When attempting to 'blow dry' the tubes, focus on velocity rather than pressure. High velocities are needed to initially remove liquid water particles, necessitating high-capacity, oil-free blowers. Approximately 200mm H2O pressure head is typically sufficient to blow the air through. The air may need to be dehumidified or heated to achieve the desired dryness. If using N2, strictly adhere to safety precautions as it can be lethal. Additionally, what is FSNL?</p>

            <p>FSNL, also known as Full Speed No Load, refers to the maximum speed a motor can reach without any external load. This parameter is essential for evaluating the performance of a motor and is often used in industries to assess efficiency and power output.</p>
