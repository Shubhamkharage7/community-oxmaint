            <p>To access their FAQ regarding compatibility with Windows 11, users are required to log in. The FAQ simply states, "No compatible versions available currently." However, it is worth considering unofficial sources, which suggest that it should work. For those interested in testing it out, it is recommended to use version 12 for the best results. Explore more on Rockwell Automation's stance on Windows 11 compatibility at https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/100-dudio-5000:-windows-11-compatibility.</p>

However, it is worth noting that unofficially, there may still be a possibility for it to work, especially if you have version 12.

            <p>I am currently running version 4.20 and have the capability to utilize all versions of RSLogix, including RSLogix Emulate 500, on my Windows 10 operating system. Similarly, several of my colleagues are set up with the same setup on Windows 11. I must admit, I share the frustration over the unnecessary additional features that Windows 11 has introduced. It seems like simple tasks, such as configuring network settings to assign a static IP address, have become unnecessarily convoluted. Recently, I found myself struggling to locate the "Copy" command while remotely accessing a client's PC, due to the abundance of symbols in the Windows 11 interface. To combat this, I consistently install Classic Shell on all Windows 10 or Windows 11 PCs I work on, in order to streamline the user experience and eliminate distractions.</p>

            <p>Navigating through Rockwell's platform may seem complex at first, but with some guidance, you can easily access the files you need. To find the file, start by searching for "PCDC Results" and then clicking on the "Versions" tab. Here, you'll find a list of versions with download links. Keep in mind that the download process may vary depending on your monitor setup. After clicking on the download button, you may encounter a truncated dropdown list, but clicking on the text on the left will redirect you to a page with a clearer list of versions. From there, simply click on the download arrow and follow the prompts to sign in. After completing a few more simple steps, the file will be saved to your downloads folder.</p>

They expressed frustration with the added complexity in Windows 11, particularly when trying to access network settings or perform simple tasks like copying files on a client PC. They prefer using Classic Shell to streamline the user experience on both Windows 10 and Windows 11 systems. 

robertmee also praised Classic Shell and uses it on their primary Windows 10 system and virtual machine. They confirmed that Classic Shell is a helpful tool for improving the functionality of the Start menu and other Windows features.

If you're looking for the Classic Shell software mentioned above, it can be found under the name "Classic Shell - Start menu and other Windows enhancements." Many users have found it useful for optimizing their Windows 10 experience, although some struggles may persist on Windows 11 devices.</p>

            <p>User joseph_e2 inquired about Classic Shell, a tool for enhancing the Windows experience. While they were able to make their work PC with Win10 functional, their personal laptop running Win11 is proving to be a bit frustrating. It's worth noting that Classic Shell is no longer being developed. Instead, users can opt for Open Shell, a reimagined version of Classic Shell. Access Open Shell on GitHub: Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu.</p>

            <p>Joseph_e2 inquired about Classic Shell â€“ is this the software you are referring to? Classic Shell is a tool that enhances the Windows experience by offering features like the start menu customization. While I was able to make my work PC running Windows 10 more efficient, my personal laptop running Windows 11 is a bit frustrating. I have yet to transition to Windows 11, so I cannot speak to its effectiveness. It seems that there is an updated version available now called Open Shell.</p>

            <p>Joseph_e2 inquired about Classic Shell. This software provides a Start menu and enhances other features in Windows. While he managed to make his work PC running on Windows 10 functional, his personal laptop with Windows 11 is giving him trouble. Classic Shell has been a lifesaver for those who miss the Windows 7 layout. To make it work in Windows 11, you need to install it, run it, and select a custom button option. In contrast, for Windows 10, you can leave the option unchecked and still have the Start icon function properly.</p>

            <p>Is there a way to restore QuickLaunch in Windows 11? QuickLaunch has been a favorite tool for many users since Windows XP. While it was possible to restore it in Windows 7 and 10, the same doesn't seem to be the case for Windows 11. Pinned apps on the taskbar can be annoying, making it more challenging to find and launch the desired shortcut.</p>

            <p>NetNathan pointed out that companies often cite two main reasons for not supporting obsolete software on new operating systems: to avoid potential issues and to encourage users to upgrade. However, in Rockwell's case, they have previously supported VMware and continue to provide some level of support for it. This means that users can still utilize old software on new systems by using VMware. In a recent technote, Rockwell confirmed compatibility with VMware, reassuring users that RSlogix 500 will work seamlessly on Windows 11. Real-world experience dictates the need for solutions to old software compatibility issues, leading to the creation of multiple virtual machines (VMs) capable of running various outdated software versions, including DOS, Windows 3.11, Windows NT, 95, and 98.</p>
