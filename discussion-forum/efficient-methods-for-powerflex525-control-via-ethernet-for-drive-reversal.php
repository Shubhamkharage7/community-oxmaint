                    <p>I am currently developing my initial program for controlling a 525 drive through Ethernet, and I am exploring the most effective approach for handling drive reversal. Our rollers are designed to operate only in the forward direction during production, but we require them to move in reverse for setup purposes. To achieve this, we utilize a forward and reverse push button to nudge the wheels during setup. Is there a more efficient method for specifying the direction other than including the direction bit in the jog command? Our system incorporates a PLC Micro850 2080-50E-24QBB and PowerFlex525 drives utilizing EENET communication.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my first program to control a 525 drive via ethernet, I am exploring the best way to handle reversing the drive's direction. Our setup involves using a set of rollers that only move forward during production but require backward movement for adjustments. To achieve this, we utilize both forward and reverse push buttons to jog the wheels. Is there a more efficient method for indicating direction than simply toggling the direction bit with the jog command? I am working with a PLC Micro850 2080-50E-24QBB, and the drives are PowerFlex525 using EENET communication protocol.

It is essential to set the direction bit correctly, as having duplicate instances of the OTE command is a common mistake. The recommended approach is as follows: first, check for the forward direction command, then the reverse direction command, and finally execute the jog command. Additionally, ensure that there is a 1-scan delay to allow the drive to receive the direction command before initiating the jog. It's crucial to remember that communication with the drive occurs asynchronously to the scan position, so timing is key. If a stop command is active, it should be released one scan before any run command is issued.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the world of PLC programming, it is crucial to set the direction bit correctly to ensure proper functionality. It is also important to follow the right sequence of commands to avoid any errors. You should aim to issue the direction command before the jog command, allowing for a one scan delay, as the drive's communication is asynchronous to the scan position.

To achieve this, follow these steps: first, execute the XIC Fwd Direction Command.4 OR XIC Rev Direction Command.5, followed by the OTE Jog Command.2. Then, proceed with XIC Fwd PB OTE Fwd Direction Command.4 and XIC Rev PB OTE Rev Direction Command.5. This sequence guarantees the necessary delay and proper execution of commands.

In your programming logic, make sure to include the necessary conditions for stopping, starting, jogging, fault clearing, and direction control. Remember that the direction command can be issued simultaneously with the run command, but it is advisable to prioritize the direction command for smooth operation.

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While it is possible to issue direction commands simultaneously with the run command, it is generally advised against. My main reasoning behind this is the following code logic:  

- O.Stop is activated when Sts_Active, Sts_ENetLogicCtrl are true and neither Sts_KeypadCtrl, RunFwd, RunRev, JogFwd, nor JogRev are active.
- O.Start is triggered when Sts_Ready, StartTimer.DN are true, O.Stop is false, and either RunFwd, RunRev, JogFwd, or JogRev are active.
- O.Jog is initiated when Sts_Ready is true, O.Stop, RunFwd, and RunRev are false, and either JogFwd or JogRev are active.
- O.ClearFault is executed when PCmd_Reset, OCmd_Reset, MCmd_Reset, or XCmd_Reset are triggered.
- O.Forward is enabled when either RunFwd or JogFwd are active.
- O.Reverse is activated when either RunRev or JogRev are active.
- O.KeypadControl is linked to KeypadCtrl.
- O.LogicCommand is modified by masking out irrelevant bits in the O.LogicCommand.  

It is important to avoid issuing direction commands simultaneously with the run command to prevent potential errors. While these errors may not be immediately apparent, it is a good practice to avoid them. For example, if the Stop and Start assertions are issued concurrently, there is a risk that the drive may fail to start altogether.</p>

            <p>Robertmee mentioned a potential issue with running a scan in the wrong direction when issuing commands simultaneously. This may not be visually noticeable, but it is crucial to enforce good habits. Similarly, if the Stop and Start assertion commands are executed in the same manner, there is a risk of the drive not starting at all. It is important to note that these commands are part of the same output bytes sent to the drive, which processes the entire assembly at once.</p>

            <p>JeremyM explained that commands are included in the output bytes sent to the drive, allowing it to act on the entire assembly simultaneously. These commands are sent asynchronously to the scan, making it impossible to ensure that all bits of the command word are set to the desired values before sending it to the drive.

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>From the perspective of an AR coder who believes that "operators will attempt anything," is it advisable to XOR the two direction signals on the ladder diagram that controls the jog bit's value? This would ensure that if both buttons are pressed at the same time, there will be no action taken, or any ongoing action will be halted.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>drbitboy inquired whether it would be beneficial, within the realm of augmented reality coding, to utilize XOR operation on the two directional inputs when writing the jog bit's value. This approach aims to prevent any unintended actions when both buttons are pressed simultaneously. It is indeed a wise tactic, especially with Powerflex systems where concurrent inputs result in maintaining the last known direction. In practice, instances of physical jog forward and jog reverse pushbuttons are rare in industrial settings over the span of three decades. The majority of jog controls are integrated within HMIs, making it challenging to activate dual inputs simultaneously through the user interface.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the information provided. I was concerned about the direction not changing before sending the run command and overlooked the need to issue OTE commands for a specific output. Thank you to DR and robertmee for reminding me that operators may try to improvise and run a unit in different ways than intended. After 20 years in maintenance, I no longer question if a steel bar will fit in a fuse holder. I have implemented a stop function on a XOR line to ensure that when the status returns, the drive stops as intended. Thank you.</p>

            <p>In relation to sending commands to a scan, it should be noted that the process is asynchronous, making it impossible to ensure that all bits of the command word are set as desired before transmission to the drive. This information is detailed in tech note QA19125. This further supports the code provided above, specifically highlighting that the buffered integer 'O' is only written to the output data after all its bits are properly configured. It is important to emphasize that there are no partial bytes in this process.</p>

As we upgrade our equipment, we are in the process of replacing outdated components such as the relay bank that controlled this unit. The manufacturing date of the machine is around 1987. Can you suggest any other networking solutions for communication? We mainly work with older retrofits that will function as independent units.</p>

            <p>JeremyM pointed out that the article supports his argument and provides a detailed explanation of the code shared earlier. In this context, 'O' represents a buffered integer that is only written to the output data once its bits are set, without any partial bytes. It may not be immediately clear from the code provided that 'O' is buffered, as it may resemble pseudo code where 'O' appears to be a direct drive command word. The process of copying or moving 'O' to the drive output word is not explicitly shown. Additionally, the statement about issuing direction and run commands simultaneously may not apply to all scenarios, as demonstrated in JeremyM's example where commands are sent directly to the drive word. This important detail may not have been clear in the abbreviated code shared for the sake of the original poster's understanding. Overall, assumptions are made throughout this discussion.</p>

            <p>In response to robertmee's comment, it may not be clear from the code provided how O is buffered. It seems like pseudo code where O is used directly as a command word. There is no indication of O being copied or moved to the drive output word. Contrary to the statement that "Direction can be issued simultaneously with Run", my example shows commands being directly issued to the drive word. This might not have been evident in the truncated example intended for the OP's understanding. It seems like there are numerous assumptions at play here. Cheers!</p>

            <p>In the context of AR coding where operators are willing to experiment, would it be beneficial to apply XOR operation to the two direction signals on the rung controlling the jog bit's value? This implementation would ensure that if both buttons are pressed simultaneously, the process would either halt or revert to a neutral state. It's an interesting perspective to consider having conflicting commands result in the system coming to a stop. Alternatively, some may opt to prioritize the initial command by filtering out all but the stop command or disregarding the directional opposite of an active jog. 
In the code snippet provided, the logic is structured to execute based on certain conditions, ensuring that the system responds accordingly to input signals. The use of XOR operation in determining the jog direction allows for flexibility and adaptability in handling various scenarios.</p>

            <p>01101 expressed gratitude and mentioned the ongoing process of updating equipment, including replacing old parts such as a bank of relays that controlled a unit manufactured in 1987. Seeking advice on network communication for dealing with old retrofits functioning as standalone units, they were directed to explore the user and ethernet manuals for the PF525 drive. Utilizing messaging for parameters not covered in the drive's IO input data or establishing datalinks with additional terminal block data can aid in diagnosing issues preventing a drive from starting.
