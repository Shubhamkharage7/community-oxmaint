            <p>To enhance system stability and organization, I manage different software versions on separate Virtual Machines (VMs). Versions 10 to 19 are stored on a Windows XP VM, while Versions 20 to 32 are kept on a Windows 7 VM. Versions 34 and above are housed on a Windows 10 VM. This approach ensures that any new updates from Rockwell only impact specific versions, minimizing disruptions across the board. Additionally, these VMs are not subjected to Windows updates, reducing potential complications. This setup helps streamline workflow and maintain overall system efficiency.</p>

            <p>plcgrasshopper expressed gratitude, affirming the advice to download software versions from oldest to newest. Following this method has always made sense and proved effective. For instance, when setting up a new VM with versions ranging from v13 to v30, a randomized installation order was used. All versions were listed in Python and then installed randomly, resulting in successful installation without any issues.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>03-09-2024</span></li>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>dmroeder mentioned that they have always followed a specific process for setting up new virtual machines, which includes creating a list of versions in Python and installing them in a randomized order. This method worked well when they needed to set up a new VM with version 13 to version 30. In fact, everything installed without any issues.

It's almost like hitting the jackpot with those same random numbers! From personal experience, dmroeder has found that installing versions from oldest to newest tends to result in the least amount of trouble. Conversely, attempting to install an older version after a newer one is already installed has caused the most issues. It's all about finding the right sequence for a smooth installation process.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>03-09-2024</span></li>
                <li class="post-author"><i class="uil uil-user"></i><span>OkiePC</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>This recurring question is often posed within our industry, showing its evergreen nature. As dmroeder aptly noted, sticking to what we know can make sense. A few years back, I encountered a situation where I needed to set up a new VM with a version upgrade from v13 to v30. To ensure a smooth installation process, I compiled a list of the versions I intended to install in Python and then randomized the order in which they were installed. Surprisingly, everything installed successfully.

It's worth noting that the compatibility of not just the RSL5K Version, but also the binaries used when compiling the installer by Rockwell, plays a crucial role. Each installer typically writes to a shared files folder, with the last installed version's files being copied to the "Common" directory. This ensures that the system operates smoothly.</p>
