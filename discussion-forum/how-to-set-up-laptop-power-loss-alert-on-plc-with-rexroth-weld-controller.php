                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have a work-related task that requires finding a solution. The scenario is as follows: I need to ensure that data from a laptop connected to a weld controller (Rexroth) is consistently collected and stored on an external hard drive. However, if the laptop unexpectedly shuts down, the data is not saved. My goal is to set up an alert on the PLC (S7-300) to notify if the laptop loses power. While I am aware of using a heartbeat for this purpose, I am unsure how to create one from the laptop and transmit it to the PLC. One possible solution is configuring an OPC server on the laptop (kepware being the preferred option), but this could be seen as excessive for a seemingly straightforward issue. Is there a simpler method to achieve this task? Has anyone encountered a similar situation? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Have you considered utilizing a USB watchdog card with an integrated relay for monitoring processes on your PC? I have previously used PCI watchdog cards for similar tasks, where the relay would be disengaged if a process failed. By connecting the relay to a standard digital input in your Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), you can ensure seamless monitoring and control.</p>

            <p>When it comes to data transfer between a PLC and a laptop, the question arises: does the PLC automatically send fresh data to the laptop or does the laptop request it? If it's the latter, what prompts the laptop to make the request? In the event that the PLC starts the data transfer, it's important to include an acknowledgment from the laptop. Failure to acknowledge the data sent by the PLC will result in a fault. On the other hand, if the laptop controls the communication, it should periodically update a tag in the PLC. If the PLC doesn't detect any changes within a reasonable timeframe, it will trigger a fault.</p>

            <p>One common question that many people have is what protocols can be used to connect a laptop to a PLC. Specifically, how can a laptop gather weld graphs from a PLC? The most common method for connecting a laptop to a PLC is through Profinet, although this may not be set up yet. Currently, there is a local Ethernet IP connection between the laptop and the Weld controller.</p>

            <p>Have you considered using a USB watchdog card with an integrated relay for monitoring processes in industrial settings? I have successfully used PCI watchdog cards in the past to ensure process reliability on a PC. By connecting the relay to a PLC's digital input, any process failure would trigger an alert. However, it is important to prevent tampering by operators who may attempt to use the USB watchdog card on other devices. To address this, it may be beneficial to install a dedicated logging computer in the control panel. You can purchase a fanless PC for as low as $49, or opt for a used laptop at $89, along with a 2TB USB SSD for $39 to store data securely. By implementing these measures, you can enhance productivity while maintaining quality control in the manufacturing environment.</p>

CoDeSys for Windows offers a Profinet IO device that can be easily configured as a Profinet IO device compatible with Siemens. The license for this device comes at a cost of several hundred Euros. Despite the price, this device offers advanced functionality beyond basic applications like heartbeat monitoring.</p>
