            <p>I am not familiar with a specific method for calculating criticality. Is there a way to determine the severity of potential Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) consequences on production and economic aspects? Can I access your Norsok 008 guidelines to understand the process better? Do these guidelines provide a framework for calculating criticality, or do organizations need to develop their own risk assessment matrix?</p>

            <p>Ali, I'm not aware of any specific standard that definitively determines the criticality of equipment. The reason for this is that the criticality of equipment is highly dependent on its function and the service it provides within a given system. As a result, it cannot be universally calculated as a standard measure, as it varies based on company policies, functions, and services.

However, there are several standards available to assist in calculating the criticality of equipment, based on three main factors: economic criticality (including loss of profit opportunities, maintenance costs, and operating costs), safety criticality, and environmental criticality. These factors are all interconnected and can be assessed through a matrix relationship to determine the likelihood of failure.

It is important to note that these factors are influenced by a multitude of variables. I hope this information has been helpful to you.</p>

            <p>Originally shared by Luca, there are various standards available to help calculate the criticality of a situation. These standards are primarily centered around three key factors: economic criticality, safety criticality, and environmental criticality. Economic criticality considers factors such as potential loss of profit opportunities, maintenance costs, and operating costs. Safety and environmental criticality are also important considerations. Luca is seeking information on internationally recognized standards related to economic factors. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When researching this issue, I initially consulted the American standards MIL-STD-882D – Appendix A and later MIL-STD-1629. Quality America Inc. offers valuable insights on the subject. This article on criticality analysis can be found on their website [INSERT LINK]. I define "criticality" as the product of "probability," "severity," and "detectability," which is crucial for determining equipment classification. It is important to consider the specific functions of the equipment and the potential consequences of failure to the organization. While norms are helpful, it is also essential to use common sense and not be overly restricted by them. In my experience, criticality assessments have involved lengthy discussions to establish classification criteria. This collaborative approach ensures that all parties involved are aligned.

            <p>Quote originally shared by Josh: I'm not sure if there is a known method to calculate criticality. Can criticality be simply a matter of deciding between a "yes" or "no" to Loss of HSE, production, and economic impact? Can I access your Norsok 008 document to identify the calculation process, or is it necessary to develop a risk assessment matrix independently? There are various approaches to calculating criticality, with two recommended starting points being MIL_STD 1629A and JA 1011 and JA 1012. It's worth noting that there are common elements shared between RISK, Criticality, and RPN, such as the "frequency criterion." There is much more to delve into regarding criticality assessment and analysis, and as a newcomer to the forum, I look forward to sharing my insights and experiences in this realm.</p>

            <p>The Risk Matrix is a widely utilized method that assesses risks based on probability and consequence. The X axis represents probability in a logarithmic scale ranging from once in 100 years to multiple times a year, while the Y axis represents consequence for HSE, Asset Loss, and Production loss. Safety scale ranges from first-aid case to multiple fatalities, and Production loss scale ranges from <$1000 to >$1000k. By evaluating each system or sub-system on this matrix, we can determine the level of risk it poses, ranging from negligible to extreme. Safety Critical Systems like Fire & Gas Detection or Emergency Shutdown Systems typically fall under the Very High or Extreme Risk category. High Risk is equated with High Criticality. This matrix is commonly used in activities such as RCM, RBI, or IPF, with a similar approach known as PRN used in FMECA analysis.</p>

            <p>In accordance with ISO18436-2 level2 standards, it is essential to regularly monitor equipment vibrations, with some critical equipment requiring monitoring every two weeks, while others can be checked monthly or every two months. However, in practice, it is crucial to consider factors such as breakdown risk, onstream efficiency, spare parts availability, spare parts costs, availability of rotating equipment personnel, and other issues like QHSE. After a 12-month period, evaluate the machine to identify any changes and determine the root causes of any issues that may have arisen. This comprehensive approach will ensure the optimal performance and longevity of the equipment.</p>

            <p>In the ongoing discussion, many valuable insights have been shared regarding the importance of determining "criticality" through methods like Risk Priority Number (RPN). Understanding the specific impact of failure on Safety, Environment, Productivity, etc. is crucial for each individual facility. Moving forward, conducting a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is essential. By analyzing data, you can prioritize the most common failure modes in machinery. The OREDA Handbook is a valuable resource for this purpose. When it comes to rotating machinery, shaft seals and bearings are more likely to fail compared to impeller wear or shaft failure. Implementing routine surveillance through visual inspections during startup/shutdown, process changes, and periodic vibration analysis is a great way to kickstart your predictive maintenance (PdM) program. Wishing you the best of luck in your endeavors.</p>
