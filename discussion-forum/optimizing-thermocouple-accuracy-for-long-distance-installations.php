                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hey there, I'm curious to hear your insights on Thermocouples and how long you can run them without accuracy issues. At my plant, we have 12 T/Cs with approximately 300 Ft runs using type K and 16AWG Type K extension cable. I plan on replacing the extension T/C cable with a shorter run and connecting it to a hart card to scale the mV to a 4-20 signal before sending it to my PLC. The T/Cs have never been accurate since I started working here, so I'm unsure if it's a design flaw or insulation degradation over time due to heat. I'd appreciate any thoughts or advice you may have on this matter.</p>

            <p>When considering replacements for long stretches of T/C extension cable, opting for current loop transmitters in an industrial setting is a wise decision. If you're experiencing issues with inaccurate temperature readings from your T/Cs, it's worth examining whether there are any AC power conductors near the extension cable that could be causing interference. The magnetic field produced by high voltage AC power conductors running parallel to the T/C extension cable has the potential to induce voltage, leading to signal noise. For example, I once encountered communication errors when a 20 ma Current Loop RS232 serial communication cable was placed in close proximity to a 480 VAC 3 Phase 60 Hz track for a hoist. During operation of the hoist, voltage discrepancies between communication bits were observed on an oscilloscope, dropping below the threshold for accurate data transmission. This highlights the importance of proper cable routing and isolation to prevent external interference from impacting signal quality.</p>

            <p>While working in the food industry, I came across solutions for managing noise issues on RTDs and thermocouples with lengthy wiring setups. These temperature sensors and transmitters from AutomationDirect proved to be an effective fix: TTD-20-N40300F-H, RTD1-25N-150-H, and XTH-01500F-K. These products are designed to enhance temperature measurement accuracy in industrial environments.</p>

            <p>OldChemEng recommended replacing the lengthy T/C extension cables, opting for current loop transmitters in industrial settings for improved accuracy. Delving into the issue of inaccurate temperature readings from the T/Cs, he queried the proximity of high-voltage AC power conductors running parallel to the T/C extension cables. The magnetic field generated by these AC power conductors may lead to noise interference by inducing voltage in the T/C extension. Drawing from personal experience, he shared a scenario where parallel placement of a 20mA Current Loop RS232 serial communication cable next to a 480VAC 3 Phase 60Hz track caused communication errors when operating a hoist. Despite the shielding of the T/C cable and all AC conductors being Teck cables, the question of whether this adequately mitigates electromagnetic interference remains unanswered. Nonetheless, these measures should provide some level of protection. Thank you for sharing your insights.</p>

            <p>NetNathan mentioned that they have observed Type K thermocouples running smoothly up to 400 feet using a 12 pair 20 AWG extension cable with an overall shield. Have you checked the accuracy of the Hart module and the thermocouple accuracy where it connects to the module? It's worth noting that there doesn't seem to be any online warnings regarding distance limitations, but it's possible that voltage drop could become a factor over longer distances. The Hart module is now integrated into my new system, whereas the previous setup had the thermocouples connected directly to an AB analog card. I've conducted bench tests on the new system and everything appears to be functioning properly.</p>

            <p>Vwillbanks33 expressed gratitude for the suggestion and mentioned they will investigate further. They currently utilize an EandH Hart transmitter TMT72. I initially employed this device to integrate an RTD into a panel lacking available channels for additional thermocouples, yet possessing extra 4 to 20mA inputs. Subsequently, I utilized it to expand a separate SLC by incorporating thermocouples. The cost of a thermocouple input card exceeded that of a standard analog input module combined with converters.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I have observed that long thermocouple (TC) runs can be successful or problematic. It is crucial to use the appropriate type of extension wire with a larger gauge and proper terminations, such as TC terminal blocks. I highly recommend considering @OkiePC's advice to incorporate a transmitter, possibly one with fieldbus capabilities like Ethernet or Io Link. However, 4-20mA can also be effective in transmitting the data accurately.</p>
