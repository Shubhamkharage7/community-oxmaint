                    <p>One of my clients is using FactoryTalk View SE version 11, while my development system is running version 13. After importing their backup file (APB) into my system, their v11 application was automatically upgraded to v13. How can I edit and transfer these changes back to their v11 system? Is it possible to have both version 11 and version 13 of FactoryTalk View Studio on my development system simultaneously?</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, there is no way to save an application in View SE for use with an older version. However, this can be done in ME, but not in SE. It is also not possible to install both versions simultaneously. To work around this limitation, I typically utilize a VM with the specific version required. Our team has set up VMware virtual machines for each version.OG</p>
