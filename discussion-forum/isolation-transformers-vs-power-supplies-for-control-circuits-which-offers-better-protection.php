                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In the past, it was standard practice for customers to request the use of a transformer to provide isolation for the control circuit from the rest of the equipment. Typically, a transformer would be used to convert 480V to 120V, followed by a power supply to convert 120VAC to 24VDC for circuits. However, the trend now is to use 480VAC to 24VDC power supplies more frequently. 

Do transformers still offer an added layer of isolation that power supplies do not? Are there any other advantages to using a transformer before stepping down to 24VDC? Is there a technological advancement in power supply construction that has made transformers unnecessary when 120VAC is not required?

When I first entered the industry, 24VDC circuits were just gaining popularity. It was common to see HMIs and PLCs powered by 120VAC, even if IO cards operated on 24VDC.</p>

            <p>While working on machines with 480/24 VDC power supplies, I've noticed a recurring need for a 120Vac power source. To address this need, I now rely on a transformer with a 480/120 voltage conversion capability for any potential future requirements that may arise.</p>

            <p>Many contemporary 24V DC power supplies now offer full isolation, depending on how the DC- terminal is utilized. They also come equipped with multiple protective and over-boost features, marking a significant advancement from traditional setups involving transformers, rectifiers, and large capacitors.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Nowadays, a majority of power supply units (PSUs) use switchmode technology with a transformer for isolation. The mains supply is rectified, chopped at a high frequency, and then sent to the transformer, which is typically smaller due to the higher frequency of the switched supply. This results in fewer turns being required. In essence, most PSUs with voltage outputs ranging from 415-120v to 24V DC are isolated. Additionally, these PSUs provide superior crowbar protection against peaks and overloads.</p>

            <p>It's important to have the control circuit supplies properly grounded to prevent voltage differences that could lead to dangerous situations. Make sure that one of the output terminals of the power supply or transformer is connected to 0V, either through the installation's neutral or a neutral line created and connected to ground. Isolating control circuits can result in significant voltage variations that pose risks of up to thousands of volts.</p>

            <p>A common question posed by controlsgirl is whether a transformer offers an additional layer of isolation that power supplies do not. The answer is yes - transformers do provide an added layer of isolation, although it should not be confused with added protection. It is possible to achieve multiple layers of isolation by feeding a 24V supply through a series of transformers. However, it is important to note that having multiple transformers in the system may not necessarily offer any extra benefits.

Another query from controlsgirl is inquiring about the advantages of using a transformer before stepping down to 24VDC. One benefit is the ability to install an outlet for devices like laptops. However, caution should be exercised as the outlet may become unusable if overloaded with high-powered tools or appliances.

Lastly, controlsgirl wonders if advancements in power supply technology have made transformers obsolete when 120VAC is not required. The answer is yes - switch mode power supplies are more energy efficient and cost-effective than traditional transformers. Additionally, these modern power supplies can be equipped with intelligent protection features to prevent downtime caused by power interruptions.</p>
