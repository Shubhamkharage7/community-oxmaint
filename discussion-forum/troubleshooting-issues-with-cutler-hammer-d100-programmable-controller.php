                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I understand that this may be an older issue, but we are currently facing a problem with our d100 wrapper. It has stopped functioning properly. While the input lights are working and turning on when pressed, the output light is not coming on. Additionally, all of the diagnostic lights are not illuminated. According to the manual, the battery should not be removed while the machine is on and the prom is not backed up. However, during diagnosis, the battery was disconnected while the machine was powered on, which may have resulted in the deletion of the ram.

Due to the diagnostic lights not functioning, we are considering the possibility that the entire board may be faulty. If this is the case, would replacing the board solve the issue, or would it also require reprogramming? We are also interested in knowing if there are any companies or individuals who can repair these controllers or even upgrade them to a newer version. Any assistance or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>If the battery was removed while the unit was off, the program stored in RAM would have been lost. If the program was backed up to the accessory PROM, it can be retrieved and restored to RAM. Without the PROM or a backup, a paper copy of the program would be necessary for someone to reprogram it. Purchasing a new unit would still require programming, either by retrieving it from the PROM or inputting it manually. Most system integrators can assist in upgrading to a new system, but they would need a program for conversion. It is recommended to have a printed copy of the current logic for reference.</p>
