                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Following recent customer inquiries, the Crimson Software Customer Notice was posted on the Red Lion website on March 25, 2024, at 18:30. Devices running versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 of Crimson® may experience inaccurate timestamps on data, alarm, and event logs around March 22, 2024. Users might also encounter issues such as device failures or unexpected restarts. To resolve these issues, users can restore operation by power-cycling the unit and clearing any displayed GMC error messages on the HMI screen using the touchscreen or keyboard. While communication functionality should be restored after these steps, incorrect dates may still be displayed. Accessing data logs via the trend viewer could lead to additional restarts or failures. Red Lion is actively working on a solution for this problem and will provide an update once it is available. In the meantime, users in need of assistance or further information can reach out to Red Lion support using the contact methods provided below. This information aims to assist individuals who may be experiencing similar issues.</p>

            <p>Check out this previous discussion regarding resetting the data log time in an HMI using RED LION HMI, which we have been utilizing for the past 15 years. Recently, we noticed that our log file had data up to March 22, 2024, at 1:16. However, a new log file was created on January 1, 1997, with data being logged in with a different timestamp. This issue has been discussed on plctalk.net.</p>

I have reached out to Red Lion and will be submitting my application to them tomorrow. If others have experienced similar problems, please contact Red Lion for assistance.

            <p>I have recently added a "Reboot HMI" button to a hidden configuration page for easier access. By setting the action tab to On Release: CommitAndReset(), users can remotely perform a soft restart of the HMI. This feature is invaluable for various scenarios, such as addressing PLC communication losses. Additionally, an option was introduced a couple of years ago for Allen Bradley DF1 drivers, allowing users to select "Reconnect on Error" to improve connectivity. I have been updating older HMIs in the field with this option, and it has proven helpful in preventing communication issues with A/B PLCs following updates or network disturbances.</p>
