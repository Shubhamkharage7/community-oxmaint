                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Seeking to see if others are facing the same problem as me. I am unable to establish a connection with a new 1769-L16ER-BB1B Ser. C controller straight out of the box, whether through USB or Ethernet. The "OK" LED is flashing a slow red. Upon plugging it in via USB, Windows 10 does not detect any connection (confirmed that the cable is functioning with other devices). When connected via Ethernet directly to the computer, Windows displays a message stating that the network cable is unplugged. I have attempted multiple Ethernet cables with the same result. Despite returning the controller to the distributor and receiving a replacement with the same part number and series, the issue persists. Tech support has directed me to tech note QA14426, where I have exhausted all relevant solutions to no avail. I am considering the possibility of a faulty batch of PLCs being produced. Has anyone else encountered this issue? Any other suggestions to resolve this? Thank you.</p>

            <p>The flashing red OK LED indicates a significant unrecoverable fault in the controller. If this issue occurs without any programming being downloaded, it is likely a sign of a defective controller. I recommend contacting your distributor to inquire about the source of the controllers, as they may be of poor quality or counterfeit. This could potentially lead to further issues with the functionality of the controller.</p>

            <p>According to tlf30, a flashing red OK LED indicates a significant unrecoverable fault in the controller. If this is occurring without any programming ever being downloaded, it is likely due to a faulty or counterfeit controller. It is recommended to inquire with the distributor about the source of the controllers. The manual suggests that a firmware flash may be necessary, which makes sense for a new controller straight out of the box.</p>

            <p>After troubleshooting, I realized the issue was with the power supply- the original provided only 0.42 amps, which was not enough for the task at hand. Replacing it with a new power supply delivering 1.25 amps solved the problem. It just goes to show the importance of having a sufficient power supply for electronic devices.</p>

            <p>If you encounter issues with your distributor, communicate the problem and request assistance from their technician to troubleshoot the connection. A successful connection indicates a problem within your office, while an unsuccessful attempt suggests an external issue.

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with your Rockwell PLC, when you report the problem to your distributor, make sure to mention the issue and ask if their technician can attempt to connect to it. If they are successful in connecting, the issue may be within your office; if not, there may be a problem with the PLC itself. I have knowledge of a circuit board shop that used to produce numerous Rockwell PLC circuit boards, including those returned as rejects by Rockwell and other customers daily. Could a bad batch of 1769-L16ER Controllers be the root of the issue? After diagnosing the problem, it turns out that a larger power supply was required. The previous one supplied 0.42 amps, while the replacement delivers 1.25 amps, resolving the issue. Make sure to ensure the proper power supply for your device's needs.

            <p>padees suggested that taking the time to read the manual may have been beneficial in saving time. In my experience, most PLC's typically only require around 200 to 300 mA. Despite informing RA Tech support of the power supply size I was using, they did not believe it was the root of the issue. Additionally, consulting the manual revealed that the current draw for this PLC was not specified, making it less helpful. Thank you for your insightful input.</p>

            <p>I have observed that PanelView Plus devices have both a starting current and a running current, similar to PLCs which may experience difficulties booting up if there is a voltage drop caused by power supply current limits.</p>

            <p>After consulting the manual without much success, I questioned whether the quality of the power supply could have been a factor in its performance issues. Could excessive ripple in the original power supply have caused problems? My suspicion is that the initial power supply may have struggled with inrush current. Despite this, I plan to have a reliable AB 120W power supply on hand for my desktop programming needs.</p>

            <p>cjarvis64 mentioned that the PLCs they have worked with typically only use 200 to 300 mA. Despite notifying RA Tech support about the size of the power supply being used, they did not believe it was the problem. The manual does not provide clear information on the current draw for this PLC, which is not very helpful. Thank you for your valuable input. If you are looking for more information, it can be found on page 10 of the manual (1769-td005_-en-p), which unfortunately is too large to upload here.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, a user named padees remarked on the enjoyment of a particular task, suggesting that the necessary information could be found in a manual on page 10 (1769-td005_-en-p). Due to its size, the manual couldn't be uploaded to the post. Providing input after a solution has been found, solely to suggest that the manual could have been consulted, does not contribute constructively to the discussion.</p>

            <p>padees mentioned with amusement that the information is available on page 10 of the manual (1769-td005_-en-p), but it's too large to be uploaded here. Good job on noticing that. The manual I checked didn't contain the information I needed, and I can't even locate the table I referenced before, which provided power requirements for various models excluding OP's.</p>

            <p>After thoroughly reviewing the thread, it became apparent that the original poster (OP) and I had both taken the time to study a manual on the CPU. However, it became evident that we had been referencing the incorrect manual. The specific information we were seeking was actually present in the manual that you shared, but lacking in the manual we initially consulted. While it is important to be helpful rather than smug and dismissive, it was valuable that you were able to point out which manual contained the necessary information and where to find it. The remainder of the interaction could have been more beneficial.</p>
