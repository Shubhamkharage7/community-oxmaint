                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In the past and present, it has been challenging to ensure that millwrights provide useful historical data in the CMMS. Previously, we would only receive information such as "replaced mechanical seal" as history. To improve the quality of our reporting, we have outlined a list of criteria for what constitutes good quality history, although not all jobs may require all criteria to be met.

While there has been some improvement in reporting, there is still work to be done. To address this, we have introduced a template with nine specific steps that millwrights are required to follow when providing history. However, our CMMS system is not currently set up to accept templates in the work history section, resulting in a cluttered history when information is copied and pasted from a Word document.

We are interested in learning about how other companies handle the following aspects: what constitutes useful or adequate history, where this information is stored, how to ensure millwrights are on board with providing history as part of their job, and feedback on our nine-step history requirements outlined below:

1. Initial complaint
2. As found deficiencies
3. Parts replaced, modified, or adjusted
4. As left condition (deficiencies corrected)
5. Deviation from specifications - indicate if data/spec sheet was filled out and if the SJP was updated
6. Possible root cause of failure (process, maintenance, design, end of life)
7. Recommendations for improvement
8. PM frequency change required (yes/no and why)
9. Technicians who worked on the job

We are eager to gather information and insights on these topics.</p>

            <p>In my experience, many millwrights have concerns about identifying themselves on official documents due to potential repercussions in the future. This perception often leads to hesitancy in signing paperwork.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Millwrights can also take on the role of data entry clerks to streamline the process. One workaround is to involve production by having them fill out a work order with the initial complaint and relevant information. Operators can assist by documenting details like part numbers and time, preventing them from disappearing and ensuring greater attention to detail. Keeping old parts for analysis can provide a clearer picture of what went wrong without the need for lengthy reports from millwrights. This can also support the case for increased preventive maintenance. While it may initially frustrate those in clean attire, physically showing them the importance of accurate data entry can help them grasp the concept better. Offering incentives for thorough documentation, such as creating repair kits for common issues, can significantly reduce repair time. Despite the challenges of data entry after a hectic shift, it is crucial to make accommodations for this vital task.</p>

            <p>Documenting history is crucial for future maintenance purposes. When a failure happens, having detailed and quality historical data from previous breakdowns can provide valuable insights into the root cause and corrective actions taken to prevent similar failures in the future. Involving millwrights in identifying root causes, recording dimensional checks, updating job plans, and suggesting improvements can prevent them from simply being seen as 'parts changers.' This proactive approach ensures a more effective maintenance process.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Listed below are the key points that should be documented in your CMMS system for effective maintenance management:

1. Initial complaint
2. Identified deficiencies
3. Parts replaced, modified, or adjusted
4. Final condition after corrections were made
5. Any deviations from specifications and whether data/spec sheets were updated
6. Potential root cause of failure (process, maintenance, design, end of life)
7. Recommendations for improvement
8. Whether a change in PM frequency is necessary (yes or no, with rationale)
9. Technicians who worked on the job

A reliable CMMS will ensure that all of this information is recorded, making it easier to track maintenance activities and identify areas for improvement.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it is essential to adhere to the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) principles when setting expectations for trades in their reporting. Trades often find paperwork tedious and unnecessary, so it is best to streamline the process by having them choose the specific cause of equipment failure from a concise list of failure codes. Displaying this information in the lunchroom in Pareto chart formats, showing the number of occurrences, downtime, and costs, can help individuals understand the data trends and underlying issues.

The next crucial step is to engage the trades in Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to address the primary contributors to failures. Regular communication at toolbox meetings about these issues and potential solutions can encourage a culture of continuous improvement. By fostering a healthy dialogue, individuals are more likely to take ownership of the improvement process and see the value in capturing and sharing quality historical data.

            <p>In order for a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) to be effective, users must actively input and maintain data. Quality data input, from work order initiation to completion, should be ingrained in the company culture and outlined in standard operating procedures (SOPs). These SOPs should clearly outline expectations for data accuracy. Emphasizing the importance of quality data and adherence to documented practices in regular maintenance group meetings will help reinforce this culture. Recognizing and rewarding employees for their efforts will further encourage compliance with these practices. By consistently promoting a strong company culture, new employees will quickly adapt and contribute to maintaining high data quality standards.</p>

            <p>Hello Rick, It is essential for both operators and maintainers to collaborate in collecting historical data. Operators should accurately define problem areas, including what, when, and where the issue occurs, and highlight its significance. By doing this, maintainers can efficiently identify the root cause of the failure. From my experience, a common issue arises when causes are represented by vague codes like "UNK" or "OTH", which do not provide a clear understanding of the failure. It is crucial to tailor the history collection process to the specific equipment being monitored. Once the data is collected and documented, reliability engineers can conduct weibull analysis to further analyze the information. Stay tuned for more discussions on this topic. Cheers, Gary.</p>

            <p>In my experience, millwrights often refrain from identifying themselves on documents due to fears of potential repercussions. One positive aspect of this practice is that it ensures operators do not mysteriously vanish. To bring operators back into the spotlight, we started posting absurd requests on the board. This tactic proved effective in addressing complaints such as "pump not meeting standards." By showcasing their adversaries on the board, the millwrights realized there was also space for maintenance-related issues to be addressed.</p>
