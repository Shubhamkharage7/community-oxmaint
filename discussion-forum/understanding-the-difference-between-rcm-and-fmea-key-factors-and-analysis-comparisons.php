                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am new to utilizing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), so I apologize for any seemingly basic questions. When conducting an FMEA, one must determine the Risk Priority Number (RPN). However, selecting the 'Occurrence' factor can be challenging, especially for a new facility without a failure history. Do you have any suggestions for this? 

Is it accurate to say that FMEA is primarily used to assess the criticality of equipment, or is there more to consider? While both RCM and FMEA analyze functions and their failure modes, what are the key differences between the two methodologies and when is each preferred over the other? I appreciate any insights you may have.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally posted by Rennie: FMEA process helps in determining the Risk Priority Number (RPN), but choosing the 'Occurrence' factor can be challenging for a new plant without failure history. Any suggestions on this issue? Hi Rennie, When facing a lack of failure history, setting the 'Occurrence' factor to 1 and focusing on the Detection and Severity factors can help in calculating the RPN. quote: Can we view FMEA as a tool solely for assessing equipment criticality, or does it serve a broader purpose? You are correct that FMEA is used for categorizing equipment based on criticality, with the RPN helping to prioritize risks within the same system. It is not suitable for comparing the RPN of different types of equipment. quote: How do RCM and FMEA differ in their approach to analyzing functions and failure modes, and when should each method be used over the other? FMEA, including other methods like FMECA, play a role in the RCM process by distinguishing critical functional failures from non-critical ones. Regards,</p>

            <p>When utilizing Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), we can assess the criticality of failure modes based on factors like consequence, probability, and detectability. The thorough understanding of the physical degradation process leading to failure is more effectively achieved through Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). While FMECA helps determine the criticality of failures, RCM excels in identifying optimal tasks for failure mitigation. FMECA is particularly valuable during the initial design phase for option selection, whereas RCM is more adept at task optimization. For further insights into RCM, refer to John Moubray's comprehensive guide on the subject. As Larry explained, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) in FMECA is calculated by multiplying three values: probability, consequence, and detectability. It is important to note that FMEA is a component of both RCM and FMECA.</p>

            <p>Larry, initially setting all occurrences to a value of 1 may seem like a logical choice. However, upon further reflection, I believe this approach may significantly impact the analysis. I do not have much experience in conducting FMEAs - have you completed one from start to finish? Using Occurrence = 1 in this scenario will demonstrate how the RPN fluctuates, allowing us to assess any potential changes in criticality rating. I am curious as to why FMEA is specifically recommended for equipment within the same system. Can you provide some pointers on this? Thank you.</p>
