                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Our 1750kW diesel generators feature a 16 cylinder V-type engine coupled to a generator for emergency power supply. The engine is started by an air motor, which cranks it for approximately 4-5 seconds (up to 8 seconds max) before the engine kicks in on its own. Recently, we encountered an issue where the air motor failed to start the engine after 3 months of service. We replaced the air motor after ensuring adequate air pressure was available for normal cranking, and the second motor successfully started the engine. As a crucial emergency device, we aim to prevent future failures. How can we verify that the engine is not experiencing excessive torque during cranking? Which routine checks can help identify engine or air motor issues? Any assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>1. Was the air pressure adequate during start-up? 2. Was the SV energized? 3. Make sure to clean the teeth of the gear or pulley on the engine to prevent any foreign material from interfering with the engagement of the motor pinion. It is possible that there is an issue with the control valve. Generally, the motors are highly reliable and can run for many years without any issues. Kind regards, Irshad.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all your hard work. I will be providing additional information. Two receivers are operating at 17kg/cm2, and air is pulled into the air motor through a filter and a Pressure Relief Valve (PRV). The PRV regulates the pressure to the air motor to 10.5 kg/cm2. I conducted measurements of the air pressure at the air motor's inlet and at the outlet of the PRV. Our usual practice is to start the engine once a week for surveillance testing. During today's engine start, I attached pressure transmitters to record the air pressures. In the first attempt, the air motor cranked the engine for approximately 8 seconds, but the engine did not speed up. However, on the second start, the engine accelerated within 8 seconds. This same scenario occurred last week, prompting us to replace the air motor. Initially, I suspected that the engine required more torque to crank on the first attempt, making it move more freely on the second start, possibly due to the lubrication of bearings and cylinders. I was surprised to observe that during the first start, the air pressure peaked at 4kg/cm2 before gradually decreasing as the air motor and engine rotated. In contrast, during the second start, the air pressure at the air motor's inlet was 7kg/cm2. I am puzzled as to why the air pressure increases on the second start if there was an issue with the engine. Can anyone provide clarification on this matter? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Jayravi, There are several important steps to take and evidence to gather, as others have noted. One key point to address is the use of a PRV. It's important to clarify whether it is a regulator or relief valve, as PRVs are not typically used as regulators. Regulators can fail for various reasons such as fouled ports, damaged springs, or leaky diaphragms. To ensure proper functioning, it is recommended to provide a cross-sectional drawing for further analysis.

Additionally, when it comes to engine testing, it is advisable to run the engine for at least 2 hours under full load conditions. Regularly testing the engine fortnightly ensures reliability and helps avoid costly maintenance. Cold running engines can lead to issues, so it's important to conduct thorough tests to prevent any potential problems.</p>

            <p>Check if the emergency lever is in the correct position. There are safety valves located at the outlet of the receiver which may be partially blocked. To identify the root cause, dismantle the pressure relief valve (PRV) and safety valve (SV). It is unlikely that the motor is the issue. Verify the PRV pressure setting. Typically, separate PRVs and SVs are installed for multiple receivers. Once the issue is resolved, please return to the site. It is important to determine the underlying cause. Thank you, Irshad.</p>

            <p>Jay, in addition, it is essential to review your power management system. In the event of a power outage, the system will automatically signal the emergency generator to backup critical equipment. The shared bulk air compressor should be able to provide enough pressure to start the emergency generator. Excessive pressure can reduce the lifespan of the generator's motor, while insufficient pressure can also have negative effects. It is important to thoroughly assess the equipment before making any adjustments or repairs to ensure consistent performance in the future.</p>

            <p>The air volume is a crucial factor to consider, especially when the psi levels fluctuate between low and high. Both psi and CFM are interrelated and depend on the system's design. It is important to ensure that the system is receiving air from the Bulk air tank through to the starter, with all air valves fully open. Have there been any changes in the tubing identification during recent maintenance? In the past, even a small change could lead to extensive troubleshooting efforts. For example, substituting schedule 80 for schedule 40 tubing by a technician can restrict system feed by approximately 8%, causing intermittent issues after the solenoid opens the system. Pay close attention to psi levels to prevent such issues from occurring.</p>

            <p>The JUST 1750 kw engine is powered by a 12 cylinder engine. Even if one or two injectors are faulty, this shouldn't impact the startup process. Each cylinder must have its own dedicated fuel injection pump. If the main spring of a fuel injection pump breaks, it could lead to rack binding and erratic starting behavior. To ensure everything is working smoothly, test the freedom of each cylinder's rack by manually pushing it inwards. Regards, Irshad.</p>

            <p>Question: Is the starter motor in your engine a turbine or vane type? Vane type air motors typically need lubrication, which is usually injected into the air supply. Make sure your engine has proper fuel pressure before starting it up. If not, try manually pumping up the fuel system. From our experience, neglecting to lubricate the air motor can lead to issues. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure the motor is properly lubricated. You can easily check this by having a mechanic open the air line near the air motor and adding a bit of oil into the line.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How can we verify that the engine is not experiencing excessive torque during cranking?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To verify that the engine is not experiencing excessive torque during cranking, you can monitor the cranking speed and listen for any unusual sounds that may indicate excessive resistance. Additionally, checking the engine's manual for recommended cranking specifications can help ensure that the torque is within acceptable limits.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Which routine checks can help identify engine or air motor issues?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Routine checks that can help identify engine or air motor issues include monitoring air pressure levels to ensure adequate cranking power, inspecting the air motor for any signs of wear or damage, testing the electrical connections for proper functioning, and conducting regular maintenance such as lubrication of moving parts. Keeping a log of these checks and promptly addressing any abnormalities can help prevent future failures.</p>
