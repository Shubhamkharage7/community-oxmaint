            <p>After resolving initial challenges, "A" has shown promising results. For optimal performance, it is crucial for mechanics to correctly install the unit by either leaving inlet plugs untouched or opening all of them to prevent damage and prolong its lifespan. Depending on factors such as extreme humidity or dusty environments, a nitrogen purge may be necessary but poses risks in confined spaces. Consider using sump heaters for applications where the unit has intermittent usage and experiences cooling between starts. Typically, cooling coils are found in reducer sumps rather than heaters, although this decision should be based on ambient humidity levels and specific application requirements.</p>

            <p>Vee mentioned considering using a portable centrifuge for oil purification. They are unsure if emulsified water can be removed along with free water using this method. To implement this, a bypass stream would need to be set up through the centrifuge and run for a specific period or until test results indicate success. Would this suggestion involve a regular maintenance routine to ensure proper cleaning and drying of the oil in each box? Thank you, Richard.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the range of gearbox sizes you typically work with, dgeesaman. Do your customers typically purchase 1 or 2 gearboxes, or do they require multiple units at each location? In cases where multiple units are needed, a portable centrifuge may be a suitable solution, especially for larger units ranging from 1hp to 150hp. While I have not had prior experience with portable centrifuges, I have always favored methods that focus on reducing humidity rather than waiting for moisture to condense and only collecting the condensed water. The ability of these gearboxes to seal well and not intake large amounts of air makes humidity reduction methods superior.</p>

            <p>Richard and dgeesaman make valid points. It is crucial to prevent moisture from infiltrating equipment rather than dealing with it afterward. Emulsions can be difficult to manage. In response to the query about alternative methods, I suggest considering the use of a centrifuge. I have personally utilized this technique in steam and gas turbines, as well as in alternators and motors with large oil sumps.</p>

            <p>Typically, centrifuging is carried out in response to an out-of-spec moisture content result obtained during regular oil analysis. It is uncommon for plants to perform preventative maintenance on oil centrifuging without prior oil analysis. While a centrifuge can help remove emulsified oil (a mixture of oil and water), I personally believe that it is better to replace the oil entirely if emulsification occurs. Continuing to operate machinery with oil that can no longer separate water properly is not advisable, especially when moisture is consistently entering the system. It is my opinion that there should be technological advancements allowing for the direct injection of demulsifying additives into oil reservoirs by now.</p>

            <p>Dgeesman, have you considered utilizing the offline filtration system developed by CJK? I am intrigued by its capabilities in removing water and varnish, but I am uncertain about the associated costs. Despite being called "offline," the system runs continuously as it is permanently integrated into the oil system. Implementing this system may require some minor modifications, such as adding a pump and filters. This innovation appears to be a step towards eliminating the need for oil analysis in the maintenance schedule, particularly for monitoring water content and varnish levels.</p>

            <p>Hey Vee, have you experienced varnish problems with your turbines? If you have, did you find using a centrifuge helpful in eliminating varnish buildup?

            <p>Richard, no problem, the topic is still quite relevant. Personally, I have not had the need to use a centrifuge. However, I will make a mental note to recommend the use of a centrifuge to our customers who heavily invest in their oil changes. We are seeing an increasing number of customers using 55-gallon drums of synthetic oil to fill their drives. In case moisture contaminates the oil, it's reassuring to know that there is an alternative to completely replacing it. While most of our customers use cost-effective methods to maintain their gear reducers, the option of using a centrifuge for oil purification is worth considering.

            <p>During my previous experience at a plant, we encountered water ingress issues with David Brown cooling tower gearboxes. After multiple attempts, we finally found a successful solution. This involved plugging the gearbox, adding fillers and breathers, fitting a mechanical seal to the input shaft, and using synthetic oil known for its lower vapor pressure at operating temperatures. The test gearbox was monitored and showed minimal oil level decrease after 6 months and a year. It was concluded that regular inspections every two years to check internal components and oil levels were recommended by the engineers. Regards, Joe Mc Cormack.</p>

            <p>Hello- I have been utilizing a centrifuge for water removal, which has proven to be quite efficient. Additionally, there are oil purifiers available on the market that can also effectively remove water using a filter and heater. If preventing varnish formation is important to you, I suggest considering an offline filtration system as part of your recommendation. This system allows customers to regularly remove moisture and analyze varnish content, which is essential for portable centrifuges or purifiers. It's worth noting that portable units may not effectively remove varnish. I once managed a steam turbine with consistent moisture ingress from the bearing box due to excessive steam leakage from the turbine end seals. Approximately 17-25 liters of water were being collected daily in a reservoir of about 22,000 liters, and the turbine was continuously in operation following long downtimes for seal replacements. The centrifuge ran for 10 hours daily under these conditions for nearly 3 years. A recent issue that arose (after I had left the company) was a sticky governing valve. Inspection of the servo valve internals revealed varnish as the culprit.</p>

            <p>An effective method to consider for oil purification is Vacuum Dehydration Oil Purification (VDOP), which can efficiently remove emulsified and free water from oil at a low temperature of 60 degrees Celsius. This process prevents oil oxidation while reducing water content to below 50 ppm.</p>
