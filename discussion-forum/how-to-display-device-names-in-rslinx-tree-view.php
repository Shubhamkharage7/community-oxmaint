                    <p>I recently came across the topic of adding a name to an RSLinx Config to have it displayed in the tree view. However, it seems that this functionality was removed quite some time ago in favor of creating a new driver for each device. Is it recommended to create separate drivers in RSLinx for each Ethernet device?

            <p>A common practice is to store IP addresses and corresponding names in a text file. This method is often utilized in conjunction with RSLinx version 4.xx at workplaces, although the specific process may vary.</p>

            <p>The Waterboy inquired about the possibility of adding names to devices in RSLinx to improve organization. It was mentioned that this feature was removed in favor of creating separate drivers for each Ethernet device. Is it advisable to create individual drivers for each Ethernet device in RSLinx for better organization and visibility in the tree structure?

In an effort to streamline a complex RSLinx configuration with over 100 PLCs, I categorized them into colloquially named divisions such as Team1, Team2, Team3. Each division had a major PLC spread across multiple stations, leading to the decision to assign a separate driver for each major PLC to manage high IO and communication resources efficiently.

After assigning colloquial names, I created generic ethernet device drivers for each Team (e.g. Team1, Team2, Team3) and optimized the settings for faster communication with the devices. This optimization led to a noticeable increase in the refresh rate for ladder IO in RSLogix.

Each driver managed approximately 10-15 PLCs, and the RSLinx file was backed up into an .rsx file. This file has been used by controls and maintenance engineers in the plant for the past 5 years, providing streamlined access and organization for the machines.</p>

            <p>TheWaterboy inquired about the feasibility of assigning names to devices in RSLinx Config for better organization in the tree structure. While this feature was removed in favor of creating separate drivers for each device, it is still possible to add a name alongside the IP address for Ethernet devices in RSLinx.

To achieve this, you can simply input a name after the IP address in the configuration window of the Ethernet Devices driver. This name will then be visible in the RSLinx RSWho window and Logix Software Who Active window. Keep in mind that this setting is specific to your computer and will not be visible to others accessing RSLinx from different PCs.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. How can I display device names in the RSLinx tree view?
- To display device names in the RSLinx tree view, you can create a new driver for each device as the functionality of adding a name to RSLinx Config for display in the tree view has been removed.
  
2. Is it recommended to create separate drivers in RSLinx for each Ethernet device?
- Yes, it is recommended to create separate drivers in RSLinx for each Ethernet device since the previous functionality of adding names directly to RSLinx Config has been removed.</p>
