                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In our group's research project, we are conducting a modal analysis on a square aluminum bar with small pillars attached to the top. Each unit cell consists of a 6x6x6 cm base cube and a 1.5x1.5x3 cm pillar, with over 15 unit cells in our model. Due to budget and time constraints, we are deliberating whether to glue the pillars to the bar or invest in creating a solid piece. Our main concern is whether the Frequency Response Function (FRF) graphs obtained from a glued structure will be sufficiently accurate compared to those from a solid piece in our modal analysis. We are focused on identifying band gaps within specific frequency ranges, ranging from 10 to 8000 Hz. Our objective is to test a theory and establish baseline results, with the aim of securing funding for a precise solid model in the future. Your insights would greatly assist in resolving this debate as we work towards achieving our research goals. Thank you for any support you can provide.</p>

            <p>It may seem improbable, but is it possible to ensure that the elastic modulus of the adhesive joint compares to that of the metal? Do you have any evidence to support this assertion?</p>

            <p>I fully concur with Testtech's perspective. When analyzing a structure in three dimensions as a network of interconnected mass-spring components, the disparity in stiffness between glue and metal elements becomes evident. Consequently, the modal characteristics are expected to vary as well. To validate this theory, a simple modal test can be conducted on a metal rod; subsequently, the rod can be segmented, glued back together with a high-strength adhesive such as locktite, and retested. Anticipate a substantial disparity in the results.</p>
