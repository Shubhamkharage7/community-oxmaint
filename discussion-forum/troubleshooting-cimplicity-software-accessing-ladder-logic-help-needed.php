            <p>Which software did you utilize to generate the .SWX file? Cimplicity is typically associated with GE's SCADA/HMI software rather than its PLC software. Can you provide the complete name and version of the software for which you are experiencing a license problem?</p>

            <p>Hello Steve, I did not personally generate the .SWX file; it is a backup I stumbled upon from an old drive. I mistakenly assumed otherwise - thank you for pointing that out. Additionally, there are other files worth noting in the same folder with extensions such as .hwc, .flb, .ssx, .vdt, and .blk, which may assist in narrowing down our search. The current software I have, along with a previously valid KEY, is CIMplicity ME Logic Developer version 3.0.</p>

            <p>I currently have CIMplicity ME Logic Developer software, version 3.0, with an outdated key. Originally released under the CIMplicity name by GE, it was later rebranded as Proficy Machine Edition. However, after restoring from the provided file, I only found an HMI target resembling a sample project, with no PLC target included.</p>

            <p>If you used the same software to create the program in the PLC and still have the installation CD, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling it to activate a four-day trial period with full functionality. However, if the PLC application was modified with a newer software version, you may not be able to upload from the PLC. Upon further examination of the file you shared, it seems to be a demonstration showcasing various HMI features through multiple screens.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey suggested that if the PLC program was initially developed using the same software available to you, it should be possible to uninstall and reinstall it using the installation CD for a four-day trial period to ensure full functionality. However, modifications made with a newer version of the software may prevent you from uploading from the PLC.

After examining the file you provided further, it appears to be a demonstration of the HMI features, showcasing various screens highlighting different functions. Unfortunately, I no longer have the installation CD, only an inactive version installed years ago. I tried to obtain a new license from GE without much success so far.

I have uploaded the entire folder related to the equipment in question, with the ladder logic possibly stored in a .flb file named "CORNIN~4.FLB." You can access the folder via the link provided below if you wish to explore further:

            <p>Several years ago, GE sold its PLC product line to Emerson. Despite the ownership change, many distributors still offer the product. It is possible that they might recommend upgrading to the latest version, known as PAC Machine Edition by Emerson. However, they could also provide the necessary key to reactivate your existing license. I will attempt to access your most recent file later today.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey mentioned that the Corning folder was a project developed using VersaPro, which was the predecessor to Machine Edition. He successfully imported the project folder into Machine Edition version 9.5 and printed out the ladder logic. This is a significant development as the ladder logic printout has been missing for almost two decades. Sebastian expresses his gratitude for Steve's efforts in helping access the files and is continuing to work towards obtaining a license key from a distributor, as suggested by Steve earlier. Cheers, Sebastian.</p>
