                    <p>Hello, I recently discovered that the Micrologix 1500 PLC is now considered obsolete and Allen Bradley no longer provides repair services for them. I am looking for a comprehensive list of A.B.'s obsolete PLCs to help me determine the best alternative. I came across a website (https://www.rockwellautomation.com/...ration-solutions/product-search/overview.page) where I can search by part number to see if a PLC is still active. However, I would prefer a larger list of all obsolete PLCs. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to find parts for a 1500 series machine, simply enter the first part of the number on the site. For example, a 1500 series might start with the number 1764. You can then browse through 2 pages of options. For quick and simple projects or machine updates, I often recommend replacing 1500's with 1100's.</p>

            <p>I was shocked to discover that the 5069-AEN2TR has been discontinued. I had no idea that any of the 5069 series had reached this point so soon after being released. And now the 5069-L46ERMW is also being discontinued? It's hard to believe that such a new controller is already being phased out. I need to reevaluate my definition of viable products, as I haven't used these in a project for a few years, unaware that they were already being discontinued.</p>

            <p>User tlf30 expressed surprise at the discontinuation of the 5069-AEN2TR and 5069-L46ERMW modules. They were unaware that any of the 5069 series products had been discontinued, as they are still relatively new. This news has prompted a reevaluation of their go-to products for projects. Check out these modules on E-bay for potentially discounted prices.</p>

            <p>User tlf30 expressed surprise at the discontinuation of the 5069-AEN2TR and 5069-L46ERMW controllers. The sudden discontinuation of these new products has left them reevaluating their selection criteria. It's disappointing to see such advanced controllers meet their end so soon. Rockwell Automation has a history of discontinuing products unexpectedly, like the ERMW model with a built-in Windows system. It's likely that not many customers were willing to pay the premium for this feature when a midrange CLX was available at a similar price point. A script found on Github that tracks the obsolescence status of parts could be a useful tool for filtering out discontinued products.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea commented on the typical Rockwell product, wondering if the ERMW model had a Windows machine integrated. It seems unlikely that many were sold, especially when a midrange CLX was available for a similar price. A while back, I came across a script on Github that extracted the obsolescence status of parts into an Excel file. It proved useful for me, so perhaps it could help you filter as well. Could you please share the link with me via post or private message? Thank you for mentioning it in your previous post titled "Lifecycle Status from Rockwell."</p>
