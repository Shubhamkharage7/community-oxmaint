            <p>Hey Josh! Are you referring to the catalog code in SAP-PM? The ISO14224 standard encompasses maintenance codes including damage, cause, and activity codes, among others.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>However, the notification item record only includes three sets of fields, including Object part for Maintainable items, Damage code for failure modes, and Cause code for failure causes. The challenge now is to determine where to input failure descriptors, maintenance activities, and detection methods within this limited structure. For more information, please refer to ISO14224 document available at http://www.branfran.com/Files/iso14224.pdf.</p>

            <p>Josh, in your SAP PM system, there should be a tab labeled "Items" on the Notification screen. This tab allows you to access codes for method of detection, actions taken (maintenance activity), and other relevant information depending on how your SAP system is configured. You can also input Symptom (Problem) codes, maintainable items (object part codes), and cause codes in addition to the Items codes. Our SAP system includes various groupings such as Method of Detection, Predictability, Root Cause codes, and Activity codes. Make sure to explore all the tabs on your notifications to access these features. If you cannot find them, they may need to be activated or configured. Kim Williams</p>

            <p>I am unable to locate the fields for detecting issues. Could it be the PMActtype field? Confirming the activity code. Has anyone utilized failure descriptors to categorize entries in notifications or order descriptions instead of using free text? How do you specify total or partial functional loss?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure you are accessing codes, make sure to check notifications rather than orders. Codes can be found in notifications, not orders. It is recommended to review the SAP notification list editing transaction selection screen (transaction IW28 or IW29) to view available fields. Press F1 for SAP help documents on relevant fields. Additionally, consider reviewing Notification Item list editing (IW68 or IW69) to explore available options. Functional loss can be indicated in the Effect field of the notification. Notification item codes are primarily used for identifying object part, damage, and failure cause. Some users utilize the codes extensively for automating follow-up tasks.</p>

            <p>In addition to the three mentioned values, ISO14224 provides a wealth of additional information. Based on the responses above, I have identified the following mappings between ISO14224 values and SAP PM fields: Method of detection - which field does this correspond to? Predictability - in which field is this displayed? Actions taken - is this represented by the PMActtype code field in Work Orders? Activity codes - can these be found in the Activity code field in notifications? Maintainable items - is this related to the Object part field? Failure modes (similar to Symptom/Problem codes) - is this captured in the Damage code field? Failure causes - can this be found in the Cause code field? Total/Partial functional loss - is this reflected in the Effect field in notifications? Failure descriptors - are these included in the notification description if it is codified? Any additional insights or comments on this topic?</p>

            <p>I strongly believe that implementing ISO14224 standards is crucial for downstream oil & gas equipment like reformers, boilers, reactors, columns, tanks, steam turbines, and seawater intake equipment. These components are not explicitly covered in ISO14224 as it is primarily focused on the upstream oil & gas sector.</p>

As mentioned, the notification item record only includes three sets of fields: Object part for Maintainable items, Damage code for failure modes, and Cause code for failure causes. However, the issue remains regarding where to input failure descriptors, maintenance activities, and detection methods. For further information, please refer to the SIO14224 document. Unfortunately, the provided link seems to be inaccessible. If anyone has a copy of the ISO14224 standard, kindly share it. For direct communication, please email eckem.sithole@riozim.co.zw.

            <p>Hello Josh, I noticed that you have shared a copyrighted document (ISO14224) on the forum, which many people may want a copy of, but it is illegal to distribute. The codes for objects, damages, and causes can be configured in transaction SPRO by creating catalogs. In your case, you have enabled the following options under Notifications content>>Maintain catalogs: B: Object part C: Overview of Damage 5: Causes. There are other options that can be activated to align with ISO14224 reporting requirements. Another approach is to store decision-making logic in a reliability package and link the outputs (maintenance strategy) to SAP. This method ensures clear links to your strategic decisions and avoids creating reporting complications for tradespeople in SAP.</p>

            <p>quote: David from Australia pointed out that the ISO14224 standard linked in the discussion is not only copyrighted but also outdated. It's crucial to ensure the accuracy and integrity of failure data entered into the SAP Notification system. Who should be responsible for this task - a Tradesman, Maintenance Supervisor, or Reliability Engineer?</p>

            <p>All individuals play a crucial role in the data collection process. The process involves a Trademan entering maintenance data, a maintenance supervisor entering failure data, and a reliability engineer approving the data record for analysis before closure. This structured approach ensures accuracy and reliability in data analysis.</p>

            <p>Trevors, are you looking to easily identify breakdown failures when creating notifications by utilizing a breakdown type with corresponding fields to check off? If your CMMS utilizes failure codes from ISO14224, you will have access to object part, damage, and cause codes within the notification system.</p>

            <p>Josh, in your daily operations, what are the specific criteria used to determine when a breakdown field should be marked? For instance, should the breakdown field be marked if a pump is making abnormal noise but is still running?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In case of failure, make sure to check the breakdown category. Even if the equipment is still functioning, it may not be meeting the necessary performance standards. Therefore, it is considered a failure if it falls below the required standard, regardless of its operational status. Be sure to clearly establish your criteria for failure and breakdowns.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you selected the breakdown field in SAP, it would calculate the breakdown duration. This duration is akin to downtime duration, which is crucial for estimating the cost of equipment downtime. If a machine is making noise but still operating at an acceptable level, it may not need to be flagged in the breakdown field. Would you agree?</p>

            <p>Greetings, I am currently engrossed in a topic related to the ISO standard 14224 (Oreda), which originated from the oil and gas industry, particularly in offshore subsea systems. Recently, I conducted a data collection for Oreda V and it proved to be quite challenging. As a newcomer to SAP and a member of the client-side team tasked with preparing for a SAP implementation, I was surprised to learn that the cause and remedy information is included at the notification level rather than within the work order itself. This can lead to a situation where the cause and solution are known before the equipment is even repaired, which goes against the usual process of conducting failure analysis during the repair process. In contrast, other software like Passport and Maximo allow for the creation of a hierarchical "failure" structure, enabling users to delve deeper into the root causes and solutions. This hierarchy typically includes the Class of Equipment, Failure Modes, Failure Causes, and Remedy. The method of detection often corresponds to the type of work order, such as Corrective, Emergency, Calibration, or Preventive (Test, Inspection, Condition, Periodic). Predictability remains a concept that requires further clarification. The actions taken are typically related to the type of activity performed, such as replacement, repair, modification, or adjustment, in order to restore the equipment to a functional state. Maintainable items refer to equipment or repairable spare components, while failure modes denote the various types of problems encountered during detection, such as fail to open on demand, fail to close on demand, or being plugged/chocked. Failure causes involve identifying the root sources of the failure, which could be related to design, fabrication/installation, or operation/maintenance. The distinction between total and partial functional loss requires clarification, while failure descriptors may need to be revisited to avoid duplication.</p>
