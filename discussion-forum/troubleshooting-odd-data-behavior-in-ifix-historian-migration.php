                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In April, I performed an IFIX upgrade and set up Historian on a new PC. The data collection has been successful, but after running the MigrateIHA_x64 utility, the imported data from the previous 4 years appears as a flat line (refer to the attached image). Even after re-running the utility today, the issue persists. I expected to see no values if the utility failed, but there are non-zero values present. The data remains consistent with the same values between 01/01/2020 and 04/17/2024. 
Could it be possible that I made an error while running the MigrateIHA utility? I selected an unused .IHC file, specified the desired date range, and opted to migrate all tags. Despite the utility running for approximately 30 minutes when selecting the oldest .IHA file in the directory, the outcome remains unchanged.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>For more specific help, it would be best to inquire about this issue on the iFix forum. I faced a similar situation when migrating from v5.5 to v7, which went smoothly. However, after migrating to 2022, I encountered problems with files created in v5.5 being unreadable by the v2022 importer. This regression was frustrating considering that the v7 importer had no issues reading those files. If you're experiencing similar issues during your migration process, seeking advice on the iFix forum could provide valuable insights.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why is the data after running the MigrateIHA utility showing as a flat line?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The imported data from the previous 4 years appears as a flat line after running the MigrateIHA utility, which may indicate an issue with the migration process or configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  What could cause the imported data to show consistent values between 01/01/2020 and 04/17/2024?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The consistent values in the imported data could be a result of an error in the MigrateIHA utility process or a misconfiguration during the migration.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How can I troubleshoot the issue of non-zero values persisting after running the MigrateIHA utility?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: To troubleshoot the issue of non-zero values appearing as a flat line post-migration, you may need to review the steps taken during the utility run, verify the selection of the .IHC file, date range, and tag migration options.</p>
