                    <p>Hello everyone, I am in need of assistance with programming MODBUS for Automation Direct Sureservo systems using AD 205 PLCs with a 260 CPU. I have two systems that require programming, but I have no prior experience with MODBUS. My knowledge of PLC programming is limited to basic functions like inputs, outputs, timers, and counters with simple addressing. Math is not my strong suit either! I have reached out to AD tech support for help, but their technical explanations assume a higher level of programming expertise. I do have a basic understanding of Directsoft "V" addressing, which I believe is crucial for this task. If anyone can offer guidance, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Will.</p>

            <p>Hello Bernie! I knew I could count on finding you here. Thanks to your help on the AD tech forums, I successfully calculated RPM's. It worked perfectly, so thank you! I followed the manual's instructions for multiple drives on the MWX and MRX, and it seems like the drives are now communicating effectively with no more comm errors. I think it would be beneficial to see a detailed program example and explanation of each segment to understand the functions of each register and box. On a side note, I have a great fondness for Washington - my mother lives just south of Tacoma. Thanks again, Bernie!</p>

            <p>Hello, what specific issues are you encountering? It is crucial to verify that you are effectively communicating with both servos. In the example provided, a single MRX and MWX with a slave address of 1 is demonstrated. It is important for each slave to have a unique address to avoid communication conflicts. To implement interlocking, I have previously utilized methods such as shift registers or stage programming to guarantee that only one MRX or MWX box is actively communicating at any given time. Feel free to reach out for further assistance. Tom</p>

            <p>Have you encountered any issues with communicating with multiple servos? In the example provided, a single MRX and MWX with a slave address of 1 are shown. It is important for each slave to have a separate address to avoid any confusion. For interlocking, using a shift register or stage programming can help ensure that only one MRX and/or MWX box is communicating at a time.

In a second example for multiple drives, everything appears to be communicating properly with the comm error transaction count staying at zero. A count interlock feature is also in place to prevent more than one drive cycle simultaneously.

One question that arises is how the MWX and MRX boxes function. For instance, when loading a revolution count into a parameter, how should the boxes be configured? Additionally, is it necessary to load revolutions and pulse counts for every movement? 

For example, if a servo needs to move 100 revolutions forward at 1700 rpm, how would this be implemented in the MWX and MRX instructions? Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>How do MRX and MWX boxes function and how can they be used to load a revolution count into the appropriate parameter? In the provided example, Rung #8 demonstrates loading a value of K3 revolutions and a Position Pulse word of K500. However, you have the option to load a variable memory location, such as V2011 and V2012, to the LD instructions for data input from a touch screen or data view.

It is essential to load revolutions and pulse counts for each unique movement, such as in the case of moving servo 1 at 100 revolutions in the forward direction at 1700 rpm. You can adjust values in the MRX / MWX boxes or use V-memory locations as shown in Rung 14.

In Rung 14, the desired velocity is displayed using V-memory; simply input V2013 (Motor Velocity Reference in RPMs) in the Data View under the Element column and type 1750 under Edits. Click on the "Write Current Edit" button to apply the changes.

I hope this information is helpful for your programming needs. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hey Wolverine, one challenge I'm encountering is that the standard V addresses provided only support one drive. I'm considering loading the data into a separate v memory location for the second drive, but I was under the impression that this process should be simpler.</p>

            <p>In the Sureservo manual, Chapter 6 provides a starting point for setting up your servos. Have you followed the instructions in the manual and encountered any issues? I have experience with Modbus on the 260 but not on the Sureservo. I need help expanding the control to handle 6 servos - 2 on each station. I am struggling with creating additional stations without their feedback interfering with each other. The sample program uses notation like N2 for each address of the second servo. I assumed the IP address would differentiate the drivers, but that is not the case. The Modbus TCP card's IP address does not prevent the stations from reading each other's feedback.</p>

Despite using the provided sample program for two servos, FrankT is having trouble creating additional stations without interference. The program includes notation for each servo, with the second servo labeled as N2 for each address. FrankT assumed that using different IP addresses would separate the drivers from each other, but this is not the case. The IP address for the modbus TCP card still does not prevent interference between stations.</p>
