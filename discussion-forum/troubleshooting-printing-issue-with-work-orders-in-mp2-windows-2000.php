                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I work as an IT specialist and recently upgraded our Maintenance Manager's PC from Windows XP to Windows 7. However, we encountered an issue with printing work orders in MP2 Windows 2000. While other forms like purchase orders print successfully, the work order only prints the blank form without any data. The Maintenance Manager mentioned that a similar issue occurred in the past and was resolved by my predecessor, although he cannot remember how. If anyone has experience with this issue, I would appreciate any advice on how to resolve it. Additionally, I am in discussions with Infor to update our software to the latest version.
