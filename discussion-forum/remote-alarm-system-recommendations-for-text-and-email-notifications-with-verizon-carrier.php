                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am considering installing a cellular alarm system with 4-6 alarms, and I want to be able to send text messages to a designated list of phone numbers. Additionally, email notifications would be a nice feature to have. The carrier will be Verizon. I am open to using discrete IO to activate the notifier, but I believe using modbus or a similar system for serial activation would be more ideal. I am also trying to avoid installing a 24V power supply if possible, so utilizing 120V IO would be preferred. Any recommendations for achieving these requirements?</p>

            <p>Sparkie mentioned a potential product from Phoenix Contact with 120V inputs to reduce failure points in a harsh environment, similar to the pump house project.

            <p>OkiePC inquired about the status of a product with Phoenix Contact, which is deemed obsolete or pending obsolescence. Is a PLC necessary for that location? A PLC is essential; an HMI is not viable. Instead, an SMS module must be utilized for data transmission. Utilizing data/hardwired IO is acceptable, but a notifier is required for communication. If necessary, an email feature through a mobile gateway can be used to send messages to a phone number. Despite the limitations, the use of an HMI configuration can complicate matters. The user is using an AD P1k PLC with Verizon as the carrier. Any suggestions for relevant keywords would be appreciated, as there is some overlap with the fire alarm/security industry in terms of key terms.</p>

            <p>Looking for an alternative to HMI? Consider a virtual HMI that is only visible when connected through a web browser. Red Lion offers a protocol converter/data logger with virtual HMI functionality. Additionally, you can enhance connectivity with cellular communications by adding a XCHSPA cellular modem option card. While this option brings the cost up to $2000, development can be expedited by starting with the example provided in the earlier link. The DataStation is compatible with any PLC, though there is no native driver for the P1K, Modbus TCP integration works seamlessly with Red Lion equipment.

For monitoring solutions, Sensaphone dialers are popular for connecting to landlines due to their reliability and ease of setup. They also offer a cellular model, which may be worth considering. However, it's important to note that using Sensaphone would require wiring your signals, which has its advantages and disadvantages. Explore their Sentinel monitoring system with cellular modem capabilities for more information.</p>

            <p>OkiePC suggested using a virtual HMI that is visible only when connected through a web browser. The Red Lion Protocol Converter Data Logger with Virtual HMI feature and VGA extension temperature options can be considered. To add cellular communication capabilities, the Red Lion XCHSPA Cellular Modem Option Card is recommended. Although this may increase the cost to $2000, development can be expedited by using the examples provided in the earlier link. The DataStation can communicate with any PLC, although it does not have a native driver for the P1K. However, Modbus TCP works well with Red Lion equipment.

In comparison to Sensaphone dialers connected to landlines, the fleetzoom cellular version appears more cost-effective. With less than 10 alarms, hardwiring may be the preferred option. This approach simplifies troubleshooting and verification of voltage to the device. The evolution of technology has led to fewer traditional notifiers on the market, with more emphasis on mobile gateways with built-in notification capabilities. While these options are appealing, budget constraints may limit the ability to invest $2000 in such a solution.</p>

The update allows users to change their SMTP port, which is beneficial as many SMTP servers block port 25. Previously, a local SMTP server was used to push out emails based on the recipient's carrier, but now this process has been streamlined. This improvement will simplify troubleshooting in the future.
