                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Simplify Status Point Energize (STE) - A Better Way to Monitor Process Status

The STE instruction was created for a specific reason. When I first started learning PLC programming, an electrician gave me some valuable advice: minimize the use of OTL (latch) and OTU (un-latch) instructions. While I was more familiar with languages like C, Pascal, and Fortran, I found latch and un-latch instructions easier to use at the time, much to the electrician's dismay.

From the electrician's perspective, using an OTE (coil) and latching it with a branch and a normally open contact was more intuitive. However, using multiple latch and un-latch instructions on the same bit can result in confusing and convoluted code. It often seems like a quick fix rather than a well-thought-out solution.

Let's examine the OTE instruction, which turns a referenced bit on when certain conditions are met and off otherwise. However, if the processor is switched between Run and Program modes, the status bit can be lost, causing issues in certain situations.

To address this issue, the STE instruction was developed. Similar to the OTE instruction, the STE instruction can survive a processor mode switch. By following certain rules, such as only referencing a status bit in one STE instruction per program, you can ensure that your logic is clear and concise.

The STE instruction also allows for triggering events based on signal edges. It contains three signals: PT (point), LE (leading edge), and TE (trailing edge), which provide additional functionality and flexibility in programming.

By implementing the STE instruction in RSLogix 5000, you can simplify your programming and ensure the reliability of your logic. For more information or assistance with implementing the STE instruction, please contact Richard Edington at[emailÂ protected]</p>

            <p>Defining actions for the false state is a common practice in programming. By setting up actions for the false state, you essentially create a latch/unlatch scenario. This code is designed to function in a similar manner, triggering specified actions based on input conditions such as XIC, BST, OTL, ONS, and Oneshot. Ultimately, if something resembles a duck and behaves like a duck, it can be considered a duck regardless of how it is labeled.</p>

            <p>The option to set actions for the false state follows a standard practice. adding an action for the false state is essentially a latch/unlatch mechanism. However, there is more complexity involved in defining actions for the false state beyond just latch/unlatch operations.

In comparing the two sets of rungs described, it appears that they will yield the same status indications. The question then becomes which approach is preferable for programming ease and readability, especially when time is limited. The status points accessible from this code snippet include ste_yours.pt, ste_yours.le, and ste_yours.te, all of which remain stable even during a processor mode switch.</p>

            <p>I am unsure of the purpose of the STE feature. While it may be useful for quickly identifying any updates occurring faster than your Laptop, I fail to see its significance beyond that. While I acknowledge the need to track changes between run and program modes, I question the added utility of the STE compared to a simple bit. The frequent switching between run and program modes is often abused, with many users doing so only to reset latches. If you find yourself using the reboot switch excessively, it may indicate a deeper issue that needs addressing. Personally, I have recently begun utilizing the STE function, having previously relied on move commands and integer values to guide my programming steps. In fact, I frequently use integer values to prevent the program from reverting or progressing unexpectedly. From my experience, using integers has proven to be the most effective approach.</p>

            <p>Clay B. expressed uncertainty regarding the purpose of the STE command in PLC programming. He acknowledged its usefulness for real-time monitoring but questioned its additional value compared to a simple bit. Clay emphasized the importance of understanding the program flow when toggling between run and program modes and suggested that the use of integers for tracking program steps may be more effective. He also encouraged users to experiment with the STE command and provided insights into its potential benefits in process control. The "Status Point Energize 2.doc" document offers a detailed comparison of using the STE command vs. traditional methods in PLC programming. Clay suggested including instructions for importing the command and examples of its implementation. By exploring the capabilities of the STE command, users can enhance their programming skills and optimize their processes efficiently.</p>

            <p>I believe that the concept is essentially a modified version of a latch/unlatch mechanism with added oneshots. It functions as a more user-friendly alternative for those who may be unfamiliar or hesitant with using a latch/unlatch setup. I still maintain that the ability to assign actions for the false state is a practical feature. The use of an OTU instruction also allows for defining conditions for the false state and is a commonly used command. By encapsulating my code in an AOI, it appears indistinguishable externally. In conclusion, if this method proves helpful to you, that's great. Personally, I find it somewhat unnecessary, as I am proficient in using latch/unlatch mechanisms.</p>

            <p>RichardE mentioned that he is curious if you were among the five individuals who downloaded the STE command and successfully integrated it into a program for testing. As far as he knows, this is the only available STE command. The key issue with switching between the Run and Program modes is that it is bound to occur. If an OTE is utilized as specified, the status it represents will be lost. Additional clarification has been provided in the "Status Point Energize 2.doc". It is not solely about tracking steps, although the STE command could be utilized for that purpose. Examination of the code variances between using STE and not using it can be found in the "Status Point Energize 2.doc". It may be advisable to include instructions for importing the command and some sample code to demonstrate its usage. 

RichardE confirmed that he downloaded the STE command and has utilized it; however, he sees little benefit in it aside from switching between program and run modes. He works on various platforms other than RS5000, which shapes his perspective on the usefulness of the command. Additionally, for individuals unfamiliar with this function, its introduction can result in confusion. Apart from serving as a test bit, RichardE views it as unnecessary complexity that adds no value to a program.</p>

            <p>Don't be afraid to break away from the norm and embrace using latch and un-latch instructions over the STE instruction in programming. The benefits of this alternative approach can be truly convincing. Once you overcome any hesitation, consider the following facts: 1. Using latch and un-latch instructions typically requires twice as many steps to achieve the same outcome. 2. This method results in cleaner and more easily understandable code, allowing for a focus on the logic rather than syntax. 3. These instructions have been thoroughly tested and successfully implemented for operating complex machinery. 4. It's important to note that STE functions similarly to an OTE instruction, maintaining its status even during a processor mode change. In my opinion, there are individuals who see deciphering overly complex code as a needless waste of time.</p>

            <p>Consider changing the name of the instruction. As I was reading through the original post, I initially thought it was about the STE instruction found in lower-end platforms. This instruction is actually the Selectable Timed Interrupt Enable. I propose renaming it to OES, which stands for Output Energize with Status. As far as I know, this mnemonic is not currently in use in the A/B world, but please correct me if I am mistaken. 

I believe this instruction could be quite valuable, but it may not be robust enough to replace my current programming methods. By adding an On delay and an Off delay to the instruction and renaming it to TOS (Timed Output with Status), it could be used as an alarm detector, photocell debouncer, or pump short cycle preventer. If I come across a situation where this code could be beneficial, I may give it a try.</p>

            <p>I am in favor of reaching an agreement. Attached is an updated version of the article. It includes the code you mentioned, more detailed explanation, and less philosophical musings. I was unaware of the name conflict, but I appreciate your suggestions.

Below is a brief excerpt from the article (due to limited reply space; I suggest downloading the PDF for more details):
***********
Keeping track of process status can be simplified with the Status Point Energize (STE) instruction. The OTE instruction, used to latch a status bit, can result in data loss when the processor switches modes. The typical workaround involves more complex coding but may still lead to data loss.

Alternatively, the STE instruction acts like an OTE instruction but survives processor mode switches. By declaring a tag as STE and using it in an STE instruction, you can trigger events based on signal edges. The STE instruction has embedded signals for point (PT), leading edge (LE), and trailing edge (TE).

For example, consider an application using the STE instruction:
{XIC SW1 STE CARRIER_ENTERING
XIC SW2 STE CARRIER_LEAVING
BST XIC CARRIER_ENTERING.LE NXB XIC CARRIER_PRESENT.PT BND XIO CARRIER_LEAVING.TE STE CARRIER_PRESENT}

The code is concise and effectively defines different status points related to carriers. The logic is straightforward and easy to read. In cases where more complex logic is required, immediate access to specific triggers, such as leading and trailing edges, can be helpful for handling data transactions.

To achieve similar results without the STE instruction, a longer and more complicated code structure is needed. This code may be equivalent to the STE code but is less concise and may be more challenging to read and write.

In conclusion, the Status Point Energize (STE) instruction offers a simpler and more efficient way to manage process status in ladder logic programming. Its embedded signals provide clarity and ease of use, making it a preferred choice for many programmers.</p>

            <p>In programming, the ability to specify actions for the false state is commonly seen as a standard practice. By defining an action for the false state, you are essentially creating a latch or unlatch effect. This code is expected to perform the same way, regardless of the specific actions defined.XIC STE_In BST OTL STE_Out NXB ONS Oneshot.0 OTE STE_LE BNDXIO STE_In BST OTU STE_Out NXB ONS Oneshot.1 OTE STE_TE BNDSimply put, if something looks like a duck and behaves like a duck, it is indeed a duck, regardless of what name you give it.</p>
