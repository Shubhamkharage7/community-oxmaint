                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I oversee a network of approximately 290 PanelView 7 Plus devices located throughout North America. These devices are PV Plus 7 Performance models that have been experiencing issues recently. Some of them display a pop-up window and freeze, requiring a reboot to resume normal operation. The problem tends to occur randomly, with intervals ranging from 30 minutes to 24 hours. It does not seem to be related to the machinery's workload or processes, as the devices are only connected to the PLC and not to any external networks.

All 30 engineers responsible for these sites began reporting the issue on Tuesday, and by Wednesday, all sites had at least one machine affected. The problem seems to be escalating rapidly, and I am in need of assistance. Surprisingly, Rockwell suggested a firmware update as a solution.

Various troubleshooting steps have been attempted, including reloading a .mer backup, firmware updates/downgrades, loading a previous runtime backup, adjusting FTLinx settings, and applying relevant patches from Rockwell's knowledge base. Despite these efforts, the issue persists.

While replacing the PanelView units with new ones seems to resolve the issue, it is not a viable solution for all 290 devices. Error messages such as "Application RSLinNG.EXE encountered a serious error and must shut down" and "Failed to load isapi dll - \windows//analytics/saw.dll" appear on the HMI during freezing episodes. I have exhausted all possible solutions and now seek assistance from the community for a resolution.</p>

            <p>It's quite strange to experience these issues. I have only a few PV+7 units, and luckily none of them have faced any malfunctions recently. Have any IT solutions been implemented across the organization? Perhaps a new probe or inventory software? If there is a specific unit consistently malfunctioning, consider setting up a mirror port to monitor the network traffic. Are all terminals displaying the same error messages, or are these errors coming from various terminals?</p>

            <p>Ken, your idea might be onto something. It seems that despite our collective engineering expertise, the team may have overlooked the fact that IT installed drops for SCADA this week. I will investigate by monitoring traffic and potentially disconnecting some cables. If this is indeed the issue, I will return to thank you.</p>

            <p>It was previously stated that the PV was solely linked to the PLC, but new information reveals that this is not accurate. It is important to verify the facts before implicating the PV manufacturer. In cases where IT is involved, which is common in many instances, responsibility is typically assigned based on the principle of "you touched it last, you own it."</p>

            <p>I consistently point the blame at the PV manufacturer, as I never encountered these issues with Mitsubishi or Omron. In my first decade working in automation, I never paid attention to firmware. However, in the past five years at an all-AB company, I have had to navigate through various versions of Studio, FTV, and Studio View. It seems like every drive requires a different software like FTLinx or RSlinx. But enough about my frustration with Rockwell.

The team is struggling to identify a pattern in the sites experiencing connection drops. Some sites have the errors, while others do not. If you have any insights or suggestions, please share them with us.</p>

            <p>It seems unfair to blame Rockwell for the lack of equipment updates within your company, considering your teams were responsible for installing and using the various versions. While I do criticize Rockwell when necessary, it appears that the blame is being misplaced in this situation. Regarding the unusual problem at hand, it is quite peculiar. While I have not encountered a wide area failure like yours with 290 panelviews, I have worked on numerous similar projects throughout my career. If this were a widespread issue, it would likely be discussed extensively on different forums, yet your case seems to be an isolated incident. It appears to be a unique issue within your infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Have you come across this Technote in the Knowledge Base regarding a possible exploit attack on the PanelView Plus terminal? The error message suggests that the target file was not found. If IT is connected to the automation network, it's essential to ensure they are utilizing robust threat monitoring software to identify and address any potential security risks. Have you conducted a test by connecting one of the faulty PanelViews directly to a PLC on a bench to see if the issue still persists? Also, when replacing a faulty PanelView with a new one, make sure they are both at the same firmware revisions. This can help troubleshoot any compatibility issues that may arise.</p>
