                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Have you tried using flinger discs instead of oil rings in pump bearing housings? I have observed that many pumps running at 3600 rpm with oil rings can experience darkening oil with brass powder contamination if the oil level is not precise. This contamination appears to be originating from the oil ring rather than the bearing cage. TriCo Manufacturing Corporation offers these flinger discs as an alternative solution. If anyone has experience or insights on using these discs, it could potentially alleviate contaminated oil issues in the field where oil mist is not an option. Your input is appreciated. Thank you, Tim.</p>

            <p>Heinz Bloch offers valuable insights into addressing oil ring instability in centrifugal pumps, suggesting the use of flinger discs as a solution. While we have not personally tested this approach yet, we do encounter issues with greying oil on our 3600rpm overhung centrifugal pumps. It is important to note that there could be various factors contributing to this issue aside from the oil ring itself. Nevertheless, replacing a troublesome oil ring with a more dependable flinger disc appears to be a practical and logical choice. For more detailed information, you can refer to the article here: http://turbolab.tamu.edu/pubs/Pump22/P22pg092.pdf</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding. Many issues have been identified, such as bent oil rings, dings in the shaft groove, and the oil level set too high, all of which are negatively impacting the performance of the oil rings. I believe that using a flinger disc can address these issues effectively. I will update with the results if I am able to replace the oil ring without encountering too many complications. Thank you once again.</p>
