                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have encountered this situation in the past and I remember what I previously charged, however, I am open to hearing opinions. A few years back, I developed a complex program consisting of over 4000 steps, with 4 analog input-outs and 2 encoders. Recently, the machine that utilized this program was sold due to bankruptcy but has been running smoothly ever since. I always ensure to place a sticker inside the programming port with my company's contact details. 

Recently, the current owner of the machine reached out to me, informing me that the PLC had completely failed (CPU error). They had a technician verify the issue and the technician mentioned that if they could retrieve the original program, they could install a new PLC and upload the program. Otherwise, it would be a costly process. They inquired about my availability to come and complete the task myself, and if I still had access to the program. 

After searching through numerous old hard drives, I managed to locate the program (which was originally written in 2010). I am no longer keen on traveling long distances and staying in hotels, as I am advancing in age. Additionally, I prioritize efficiency and do not believe in unnecessary travel for work. Now that I have found the program, the question remains - how much should I charge for simply attaching it to an email and sending it over?</p>

            <p>Hello Ron, the situation can vary. If the customer only requires the program but plans to have someone else install it on the PLC, you may consider requesting compensation for your efforts in obtaining the program. This could entail asking for a substantial amount to reflect the value of the intellectual property of the program. However, excluding ongoing support, could you potentially request a fee in the thousands? On the other hand, if the customer requires support, it would be appropriate to provide a quote for additional assistance at an hourly rate. This is a possible approach to consider in handling this situation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Determining the rightful owner or holder of the program is essential in this situation. I concur with @AlfredoQuintero's suggestion of charging <your going rate>/hour for the hours spent searching through old hard drives, with a minimum of 1-2 hours. Additionally, consider adding a fee for the effort required to ensure proper backup to prevent future issues. Without this additional fee, invoicing may not be worthwhile, making you the helpful individual in this scenario. Alternatively, you could view it as a loss leader by offering your services for free in exchange for potential future collaborations or positive recommendations. However, if you do not typically handle such requests, this may not be a feasible option.

On a side note, it is worth considering if the other party involved may come across this discussion in a public forum. If so, they may choose to address the situation promptly with a monetary offer to avoid further complications.</p>

            <p>There have been various valid perspectives shared, however, without information on the hourly rate of the machine, it is difficult to determine its value to the owners. It is also unclear if there is potential for additional enhancements through a rewrite and investing in additional instruments. To calculate the cost, I recommend charging for the hours spent searching for software and processing invoices, rounding up to the nearest 4-hour increment.</p>

            <p>I concur with the prevailing viewpoint. If there is no specific intellectual property like Ron S Magic (tm) involved, it is advisable to bill for the time spent on the task, rounding up for administrative costs, and then allowing the client to proceed. My stance is typically that in the case of custom machinery or integration, the ownership of the code should belong to the system owner, unless otherwise agreed upon beforehand.</p>

            <p>When determining pricing for providing a PDF of a program to convert to a newer PLC for the original owner who is still in business, I would base it on a range between zero and the standard office rate multiplied by the amount of time spent.

            <p>I am still waiting to hear everyone's perspectives on this issue. Your programming services were compensated for based on the original purchase order for the project. If you maintained your work by purchase order number and job number, as best practices dictate, fulfilling their request should not be a difficult task. Provide them with the program they paid for to ensure customer satisfaction and potentially secure future work. Even if they are not the original owner, handling this situation professionally can lead to more opportunities down the line. It's puzzling to me that they are attempting to charge for this service, as it seems like a straightforward decision. Perhaps this attention to detail is why I consistently attract new projects.</p>

            <p>Now is the perfect opportunity to review your program and documentation to determine if any updates are necessary based on your current programming skills. Reflecting on machines I programmed nearly three decades ago, I am amazed at how they operated safely without any incidents. It makes me ponder, "What was I thinking?" Avoid labeling these updates as "safety updates" due to potential liability and warranty implications. Instead, refer to them as "feature" or "operational" updates to avoid complications with charging for them or being required to perform them if a safety issue is identified.</p>

            <p>Scottryan03 raised an interesting point that has sparked discussion among various individuals. It is important to consider that programming labor costs were already covered in the original purchase order for the project. If you need access to saved projects by PO#, Job#, etc., don't hesitate to contact Minster Press in Ohio. However, be prepared for some light-hearted laughter and banter as they may have already been compensated for the requested information.

In a recent experience, I required a schematic for a circuit board testing machine that had undergone a feature change in 1998. While most companies charge a substantial fee for schematic PDFs and PLC programs, there are exceptions. French Oil stands out as a rare example, providing me with a free schematic and PDF of the PLC program when I needed to create a new control for a press. This level of service is uncommon in the industrial maintenance field, where obtaining essential documents like MSDS's can often come at a price.</p>

            <p>If you need a schematic or a copy of a program from Minster Press in Ohio, don't be surprised if you hear laughter and jokes when you ask - they charge a premium for these documents. I recently needed a schematic for a circuit board testing machine that had undergone a feature change in 1998. The current model schematic is priced at $900, while the pre-1998 model schematic costs $5,000. Additionally, copies of the PLC programs are even more expensive than the schematics.

In my 42 years of experience, only French Oil Company has provided me with a free schematic and PLC program PDF when I needed to design and construct a new control system for a press. This outdated way of doing business is not sustainable, and companies following this practice will soon find themselves struggling for business. It's time to embrace a more customer-friendly approach.</p>

It's important to note that the customer requesting the file is not your client, so there's no obligation to fulfill their request. If it were my original customer, I would provide the program for free and even offer remote desktop assistance to install it on a new computer as a marketing gesture, but I wouldn't extend the same courtesy to a different buyer.</p>

            <p>Have you considered charging a nominal fee of 1 cent per bit of the file size for "storage rental"? This unique approach can help you monetize your data storage services effectively.</p>

            <p>The issue has been resolved. While I agree with some comments and disagree with others, I appreciate everyone's input. The initial project was a one-time job back in 2010. If the company had reached out to me, I would have gladly attended to replace the PLC and only charged for labor and parts. This is a service I have provided on multiple occasions, including replacing dead batteries and restoring programs from my backups.

Although this company is located far away and it's unlikely I will receive future work from them, they have chosen to use a local programmer for the job. After converting my original 2010 invoice to 2024 rates, I charged them 10% of the programming cost, which amounted to thousands of pounds. They have since paid, and I assume everything is now up and running smoothly.</p>

            <p>dummy_bit expressed disbelief in companies that fail to have spare equipment and backup procedures in place, leading to inevitable failures. This lack of preparedness is often attributed to incompetence, as many decision-makers prioritize social connections over asset management. Additionally, operational managers may only focus on short-term goals, neglecting long-term planning.

Furthermore, a lack of understanding of financial principles and project pricing can hinder funding for necessary upgrades. Demonstrating the potential risks and costs associated with a project is crucial in securing support. joseph_e2 shared a frustrating experience with an OEM who provided limited and inconveniently large paper drawings, making it difficult to work with the supplied information.

The challenges of obtaining necessary documentation are further exemplified by the lack of digital copies provided by certain companies, such as Samsung when purchasing a drillship. Despite the importance of digital files for efficiency, some companies still rely solely on printed materials.</p>

            <p>The perception of your business is crucial when it comes to customer relationships. I once had a client whose Omron HMI screen failed, and the original company quoted them around 8k for a replacement and programming. After a quick search online, the client found the same HMI for about 2k, saving them 6k. I was able to transfer the program to the new HMI at a cost of 3k, and the client was satisfied with the outcome. This experience highlighted the importance of fair pricing and honest practices in building a good reputation as a supplier or manufacturer. By treating others the way you want to be treated and offering quality products at reasonable prices, you can attract loyal customers and sustain repeat business. This philosophy is what drove me to enter the supply industry, as I knew I could provide a better experience for clients who value integrity, quality, and efficiency in every transaction.</p>
