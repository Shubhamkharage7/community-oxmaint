                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I own a sizable drying system used for drying polymer products in crumb form. The dryer beds vibrate on 6 feet by 20 feet long perforated beds, similar to a large air hockey table stroking at a 45-degree angle and 700 CPM. There are large hoods placed over the beds that operate under vacuum to collect the air from the crumb, allowing for the collection of hydrocarbons. The movement of the beds causes the stationary hoods to act like large pistons, with pneumatic pulsation impacting both the hoods and downstream cyclones. The vibrations are so intense that they are affecting structural steel 200 feet away. Despite conducting vibration studies that ruled out natural frequencies, I am in need of a large pulsation absorption system to mitigate the pressure pulses within the hoods. The hoods measure 6 feet wide by 20 feet long by about 6 feet high, while the downstream ductwork is 36 inches in diameter. This project requires a specialized solution, and I am seeking suggestions for a suitable system. Any recommendations will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>To effectively address the sound pressure levels in your environment, the first step would be to analyze the dominant frequency, which is commonly searched as 11.7 Hz. Subsequently, a thorough examination of the duct system should be conducted to identify potential sources of acoustic resonance. Given the wavelength of approximately 94 feet, it is important to assess the duct length for possible resonance issues, considering factors such as end-conditions. Furthermore, a detailed evaluation of the system for other acoustical characteristics is recommended. To mitigate noise and pulsations, various noise control methods can be implemented, including modifying the excitation frequency, utilizing tuned duct side branches, incorporating Hemholtz resonators (if applicable), or installing perforated plates or small tubes in baffles. As a qualified Noise Control Engineer, I am here to assist you in addressing any noise-related concerns. For further inquiries, feel free to reach out to me at w_f_strong {at} msn [dot] com.</p>
