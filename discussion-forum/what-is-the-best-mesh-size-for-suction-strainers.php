                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I'm seeking advice on suction strainers and wondering what is considered the right mesh size for optimal performance. Sometimes we come across pump strainers with no mesh or with mesh that is too fine. Is there a standard guideline for the proper mesh size, taking into account the type of product being pumped? Recently, we encountered a 'Y' strainer with perforated S/S plate and two layers of mesh (14 Mesh with an aperture size of 1.35mm and 40 Mesh with an aperture size of 0.41mm). When replacing it, there was a question if the 14 mesh could be omitted and only the 40 mesh used instead. How do others tackle this issue? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your time.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering whether to use a strainer in your process, it's important to evaluate each situation individually. Factors to consider include what you are trying to safeguard with the strainer, the cleanliness of your process fluid, and how sensitive your equipment is to dirt particles. For example, will the strainer solely protect the pump or will it prevent fouling in a more costly heat exchanger downstream? If the particles in your fluid are larger than the wear ring clearance, you could potentially damage your pump before it even starts. 

There are several variables to consider before making a decision, making it difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution. In some cases, such as the one you described, the complexity of the strainer element may seem unnecessary. The addition of an extra layer, particularly one that serves no apparent purpose beyond reinforcing the finer mesh, may not be essential. If the fine mesh was added later on and your process fluid is not consistently clean, the strainer could quickly become clogged. 

It's important to determine if the pump actually requires such a high level of cleanliness, as removing unnecessary components could streamline your process. Additional information would be needed to make a definitive recommendation, but it may be beneficial to explore the possibility of removing the intermediate layer in the strainer.</p>

            <p>Richard, you gave a thorough explanation. It's important to clearly outline what you don't want in a system or product downstream to avoid any issues. Providing more specific details about certain aspects could lead to more helpful responses. I apologize if I did not fully address your question.</p>

            <p>What is the purpose of strainers in a pumping system? Are they used to ensure product quality or to safeguard the pump against contaminants? Strainers on the suction side are not as effective as those on the discharge side. For improved product quality, consider installing duplex strainers on the pump discharge outlets.</p>
