                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>How to calculate the Full Load Amperage (FLA) of single phase components when operating on a 3 phase service can be a common question. For instance, with a 480V/3PH service, consider a 3kW electric heater operating at 480V/3PH, and a 1KVA transformer at 480V/1PH. To determine the total panel FLA, you may need to use formulas such as (3000 / (480 * 1.73)) + (1000 / (480 * 1.73)) = 4.8. Another approach could be (3000 / (480 * 1.73)) + (1000 / 480) = 5.7. It's crucial to calculate the FLA accurately for proper electrical capacity planning.</p>

            <p>The bottom equation in your formulas is accurate, while in the single-phase calculation at the top, the square root of three is unnecessary. To improve accuracy, power factor should be included in 3-phase load calculations. A common practice is to use a power factor of .9 (Watts / 480 x 1.73 x .9 = current).I hope this information is useful to you.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your input. While my usual approach has always worked for me, I have recently been contemplating the possibility that I may be overlooking a critical element. Despite my efforts, I have yet to pinpoint what that might be.

In relation to your follow-up query about the scenario with (3) single-phase 1KVA transformers evenly distributed across the 3 legs, it seems to me that dividing by sqrt(3) would result in a total Full Load Amps (FLA) of 3.6 instead of 6.25. Is my understanding correct in this context?

Moreover, if there were only 2 transformers involved, I am struggling to articulate my question clearly. I am curious about when sqrt(3) becomes relevant in such situations. After dedicating numerous hours to research, I am still unable to grasp this concept fully. Could someone direct me to a relevant whitepaper, video, or resource that explains this in detail?</p>

            <p>When connected to a two-phase transformer, the three-phase resistive load of 3000/480 * 1.73 will only be added to the two connected phases, requiring an additional 1000/480 * pf. The power factor (pf) of the transformer can vary, typically starting at 0.9 at full load. As with motors, the power factor will decrease as the load on the transformer decreases. This variability in power factor is important to consider when calculating the overall efficiency of the system.</p>

            <p>When determining the 3-phase loads and calculating the load for a 110-volt transformer and possibly a 240-volt transformer for AC units, it is essential to consider all three phases. Additionally, accounting for the appropriate factor for 3-phase loads, such as a factor of 1.25 for motors, is crucial for an accurate calculation. To account for any oversight or additional requirements, be sure to add 30% to the total load. This is a brief response as I am currently on break. - James</p>
