                    <p>Hello, 

I am seeking assistance with identifying and operating a BBC Veritron DC Drive that is currently unmarked with no identifying plates. I am unable to determine the specific type of drive and am in need of a manual for operating, configuring, and testing purposes. The drive is experiencing issues with powering three DC motors despite receiving AC power from a 2-phase 400V/200V transformer. I require guidance on troubleshooting and establishing the necessary conditions for the drive to function properly. Any advice or recommendations on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

            <p>In response to a query by BryanG, I found the answer on the PLC forum here: http://www.plctalk.net/qanda/showthread.php?t=67640. I discovered this forum while researching, but the drive mentioned is not the same type as mine. My motors have 6 terminals - 2 for current, 2 for tacho, and 2 for thermal. This drive has outputs for the rotor and stator - can you explain how it works? I must admit, DC motors and thyristor drives are quite complex subjects for me.</p>

            <p>Reflecting on the past, it appears to be a vintage DC Single Phase drive from the late 1950s or early 1960s, marking the shift from vacuum tubes to solid state technology. The motor in question sounds like a series wound DC motor with only two power connections, A1 and A2 (or A+ and A-). It is crucial not to disconnect the motor from the load for testing, as this could lead to detrimental outcomes.

Based on your description of the power source, it seems likely that it is a single-phase system rather than two-phase. Two-phase power was utilized briefly in the northeastern United States before World War II, with the transition to the current 3-phase system we use today. While some may refer to single-phase 120/230V systems as 2-phase, it is technically still single-phase.

If provided with a clearer image of the board terminals, I may be able to offer more assistance. Consider upgrading the drive to a newer model or switching to an AC motor with a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) for enhanced efficiency and performance in the long term.</p>

            <p>The merger between BBC and Asea leading to the establishment of ABB occurred in 1988, well before the digital revolution took off. It's been almost 30 years since that merger, and it's unlikely that any information about the drive has been digitized and maintained online for over two decades. As a result, finding the necessary parts to repair it may prove to be a challenge. It may be time to consider replacing it with a more modern alternative.</p>

            <p>GaryS mentioned reminiscing about an old DC drive from the late 50s or early 60s, before the transition from vacuum tubes to solid state technology. The motor in question seems to be a series wound DC motor with only 2 power connections. It is at least 40 years old and still operational when supplied with 18VDC power. Despite some technical issues, experts advised against disconnecting the motor without further assessment. Suggestions were made to upgrade to a newer drive or switch to an AC motor with a VFD system for better performance in the long term. However, the owner is hesitant due to the cost involved. It may be time for a replacement, but the decision rests with the owner. Special thanks to BryanGandiant for providing additional information on the subject. Further updates on troubleshooting and repair will be shared in the future.</p>

            <p>Repairing a malfunctioning item may not be worth the time and effort, as other issues may arise shortly after. It is often more cost-effective to simply replace it. Bardac offers a quality line of DC drives at affordable prices. When troubleshooting, it is important to focus on the motor rather than the drive itself. The speed of a series wound DC motor is primarily determined by the load on the motor shaft. It is crucial to test the motor properly, possibly by contacting a reputable motor shop for inspection.</p>

            <p>The operation of this drive involves controlling 3 motors through contactors. However, there seems to be an issue with the drive not properly functioning with all 3 motors. I will attempt to troubleshoot and repair the issue. If the problem persists, the owner may need to consider purchasing a new drive or a new drive and motor combination.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to understand how motors with 6 terminals work, you've come to the right place. This specific drive has output to both the rotor and stator, making it different from what you may be used to. If DC motors and thyristor drives are a mystery to you, don't worry - you're not alone. Take a look at the attached file for more information. Remember, learning about different types of drives and motors is essential for anyone interested in the field.</p>

AC servomotors have largely replaced them since I was born. While attempting to repair some thyristor drives, I found them to be very unstable. One small mistake could easily result in blown fuses.

            <p>SCR's, not Thyristors, are commonly found in DC drives from older models till now. Repairing them may not be cost-effective, as it is often more affordable to replace them. When connecting a different motor using a contactor, make sure to switch the tach leads as well. If the motor is slowing down, check the current input as it may be overloaded. The drive may not be able to handle the load, hence the motor slowing down. It should have tripped the breaker if installed correctly. While your system may be labeled as 2 phase 400/200V, it is more likely to be 3 phase as 2 phase power is no longer commonly used. A true 2 phase system would have 4 wires, whereas a standard 3 phase system has 3 wires. Single phase systems have only 2 wires. It is essential to differentiate between single and 2 phase systems, as the latter is no longer widely used and has been replaced by 3 phase systems.</p>
