            <p>Have you recently completed a three-day training course focusing on ODS? If so, it's important to ensure you gained valuable knowledge and are able to ask targeted questions. Search through this discussion forum for further insights, as this topic has been addressed multiple times. While members are willing to provide assistance, it's unlikely they can fully substitute for an unsuccessful training experience.</p>

            <p>Welcome to ODS/Modal Analysis! I echo Walt's sentiments and am surprised that you didn't leave a three-day course in ODS with a clear roadmap for moving forward. In my opinion, a solid grasp of your data collector is essential. Concentrating on data collection for Cross Channel phase, Coherence, and Resonance Detection is crucial. Your training should have enhanced your understanding of these key areas. If you regularly collect data on machines, you likely have some that require detailed diagnostics. When a machine requires analysis, my initial step is to create a precise drawing of it. For example, when examining a fan, I sketch the base, motor support, fan support, fan bearing configuration, and fan housing. During this process, issues often come to light, such as cracked supports or loose bolts. By inspecting the structure up close, you can uncover modifications made to strengthen the machine while keeping costs in check. Sometimes, when inspecting similar equipment, you may identify a component that was overlooked. I've encountered this situation with new machines, where the manufacturer had to bring in a contractor to reinforce the structure. It's important to establish vibration acceptance criteria for all new machinery. Providing answers to Tom's inquiries will prompt more meaningful responses from other forum members. Enjoy the journey into ODS, a truly fascinating field of study.</p>
