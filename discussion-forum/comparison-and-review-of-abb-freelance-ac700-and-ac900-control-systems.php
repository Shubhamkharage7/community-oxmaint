                    <p>Hello everyone, my colleague and I are currently in the process of planning an upgrade for our system's control components, including mixers, water counters, and temperature controllers. Our system mainly involves digital IO, 4-20mA input, and RTD temperature probes, and we anticipate needing at least 300 I/O points. 

We are interested in hearing about your experiences with ABB's Freelance AC700 and AC900 products. What are your thoughts and reviews on them? My colleague is considering these products due to their affordability (approximately $6k CAD for 300 I/O points), but I personally have had some reservations about ABB's control systems in the past. I have had more positive experiences with products from AB and would prefer them if the price is right. Thank you for your input!</p>

            <p>When considering the IO count, it may be beneficial to utilize the ABB AC500 with ABB Compact HMI or a third-party SCADA system such as Ignition. In my opinion, I do not favor the AC700 Freelance as much.</p>
