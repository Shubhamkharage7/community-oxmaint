            <p>WonderWare is a highly recommended choice for its reliability and ease of use. While it is known for its flexibility, Ignition is also a strong contender that is more budget-friendly. It can be a tough decision, but both options have their merits.</p>

            <p>Determining what is "easy to learn" can vary from person to person. A recent discussion on this topic was seen here a few weeks back, similar to your question. If you are using Beckhoff hardware, consider looking into Ignition and TwinCAT HMI. Despite its name, TwinCAT "HMI" offers more than just standalone HMI capabilities - it can easily scale up to a full SCADA system as well. While I have some experience with both platforms, I wouldn't consider myself an expert on either. It's recommended to thoroughly research both solutions, as the final decision may come down to cost considerations.</p>

            <p>After successfully downloading and installing Ignition, I am amazed at its innovative features! Thank you, team. WonderWare has a reputation for being one of the top SCADA systems, although I have yet to try it out personally. Are there any limitations on exporting to Eastern countries or other regions that you are aware of?</p>

            <p>Are you in need of a small system with just a few points and an HMI, or a larger system with 60K points for an entire plant? Beckhoff's TwinCat3 includes its own built-in system (Codesys) for seamless integration. There are numerous options for SCADA systems, catering to different platforms. Licensing costs often play a significant role in decision-making, with some customers dictating the preferred system to use.</p>

He also inquired about WonderWare, a reputed SCADA system known for its performance. Farnesi asked about potential restrictions on exporting to Eastern countries or any other region. In some cases, a shift to Linux + Something may be necessary due to historical limitations on using Windows in certain countries in the Middle East.</p>

            <p>mad4x4 inquired about the scale of the system needed, whether it is just a few points and an HMI or a full plant with 60K points. Beckhoff (Codesys) has its own system integrated into TwinCat3. When choosing a SCADA system, various factors come into play, such as licensing costs, practicality, and customer preferences.

The project is substantial, estimated to have over 20K I/Os and will be divided into two separate systems. For critical processes, is Ignition recommended? Is it known for its stability and reliability? How well do its redundancy services and servers perform?</p>

            <p>Farnesi inquired about the stability and reliability of the system as well as the effectiveness of redundancy services/servers. Igntion is highly stable and can easily be configured for redundancy, making it a reliable choice for businesses. It is compatible with Linux and can be set up with both Windows and Linux servers for redundancy purposes. Handling 20K tags on a single server is effortless for Igntion, and it can manage up to millions of tags on server clusters without any issues. It is recommended to have a separate I/O server for sub 200K tags.</p>

There are various SCADA options available for different platforms, with licensing costs often influencing the decision-making process. Sometimes, the choice of system is dictated by the customer's requirements.

Chris Taylor highlighted the stability of Ignition, mentioning its ability to be configured for redundancy and run on Linux. He shared that 20K tags on a single server is easily manageable with Ignition, with instances of server clusters handling millions of tags. Additionally, Chris mentioned considering reaching 100k I/Os, as each instrument/valve typically has 4-5 I/Os.

Furthermore, Chris expressed his interest in finding companies in Italy, Austria, or Germany that could provide support. If anyone has any recommendations, please share them.</p>

            <p>In order to communicate with Beckhoff controllers, it is recommended to use an OPC server with Ignition, whereas TwinCAT HMI already comes equipped with a direct driver. This distinction could have a notable impact on overall performance. Upon initial exploration, it appears that Beckhoff is positioning TwinCAT HMI to be a competitor to Ignition in the market.</p>

            <p>Previously, I utilized VB.net to create custom HMI's for data file storage in conjunction with Beckhoff PLC before facing a layoff. However, we aimed to streamline processes by implementing a commercially-available solution for a single control room. This would empower zone engineers to create their own HMI's without the need to delve into Visual Studio. Based on recommendations from local Beckhoff support, options like WonderWare and Indusoft were considered. WonderWare presented an attractive offer of approximately $10K, inclusive of all additional features, assuming the client had substantial financial resources, particularly in the aerospace sector. For government-funded projects, costs were kept to a minimum, especially for "overhead" initiatives. Ultimately, I opted for Indusoft due to its affordability at $700 and perceived ease of use. While the zone engineers successfully developed an HMI using Indusoft, one individual had background in Windows programming (specifically older C), raising the question of whether it was truly easier to navigate compared to Visual Studio. This decision was made around 2012. I have since come across advertisements for Ignition, which I intend to explore further. Additionally, AdvancedHMI, a free VB.net source code crafted by Archie, is worth considering for those seeking customizable solutions. Although the capabilities of AdvancedHMI in data collection remain uncertain, the option of incorporating file-saving functionalities into the VB code independently is available.
