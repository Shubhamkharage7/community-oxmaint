            <p>Although RIME is a scheduling feature in Maximo 5.2, we have not yet implemented it. After researching "RIME index scheduling" on Google, I found a link that may provide more information: http://www.google.com/search?h...m1&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=. For a detailed description of RIME, refer to page 123 of the book preview. Additionally, there are charts included after the text. Explore further to understand how RIME can benefit your scheduling needs.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What is the Rhyme or Rhyne technique for work order scheduling?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The Rhyme or Rhyne technique is a method of assigning priorities to work orders to ensure that higher priority tasks are scheduled first. It is an effective methodology for optimizing work order scheduling.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can I implement the Rhyme or Rhyne technique in my work order scheduling process?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To implement the Rhyme or Rhyne technique, you can start by assigning priorities to each work order based on factors such as urgency, complexity, or impact on production. Then, schedule the work orders in order of priority to ensure that higher priority tasks are completed first.</p>
