                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! Recently, the company I have joined still has some spare valves left over from previous orders. Now, we are in need of additional valves for a different machine, but the ones we have are AS-interface actuators. The valves in question are from the brand SPX, specifically the CU41 plus T model. I am wondering if there is a way to repurpose these valves as regular actuators, operating on a 24vdc system with ON and OFF functionalities. Perhaps there is a module available or a specific wiring modification that can be made to achieve this. These modified valves will be integrated with an AB PLC (module 1734-OB4E). I am considering cost-effective solutions and would prefer not to invest in the AS interface gateway and complete setup. I am exploring options to either purchase new regular 24vdc valves or a new SAi setup, or potentially modifying the existing ASi valves to function as regular actuators. Any advice on the best course of action would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>We have utilized numerous units of this valve on a large ASI-controlled system. There is a specific head system named e CU4 D4 IECE that can be attached directly to the valve. However, we have not actually used these heads ourselves. Our buyer mistakenly received ASI heads as spare parts, prompting us to explore the option of purchasing different control heads for replacement. The ASI system operates at around 30 volts, so it is likely that the solenoids and sensors are also 24 volts. This suggests the possibility of connecting the sensors and solenoids directly to the PLC via 24-volt DC inputs/outputs. It is advisable to confirm the voltage of the sensors and solenoids when in use. If they indeed operate at 24 volts, then there should be no issue connecting them to a connector block. One of our engineers had a similar experience when replacing a valve on a non-ASI system with an ASI valve. It remains unclear whether the engineer replaced the sensors and solenoid components or simply wired them directly.</p>

            <p>Parky mentioned that they have used numerous units on a large ASI controlled system. There is a specific direct connect head system, known as the e CU4 D4 IECE, that can be attached to the valve. Although Parky has never used this system personally, they are aware of it because their buyer ordered some ASI heads as backups but received the wrong ones. This mix-up revealed that it is possible to purchase different control heads and swap them out. Parky suggests checking the voltage of the sensors and solenoids to ensure compatibility with the ASI system, which typically operates at around 30v. If the sensors and solenoids run on 24v, then they can be connected directly to a PLC using 24v dc inputs/outputs. One of Parky's colleagues successfully integrated an ASI valve into a non-ASI system by potentially replacing the sensors/solenoid or wiring them directly. If there are any questions or concerns about wiring directly, feel free to ask for clarification or assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Marcktony, it's been a while since I've seen these in person, but in theory, you could potentially bypass the control board. Typically, these valves contain simple solenoids. However, it may be more beneficial to order the correct head as Parky suggested, to avoid frustration or causing damage to a functioning ASi head. Depending on the type of valve body you have, many of these heads are interchangeable. For example, a GEA or Burkert head may be a suitable alternative. Ultimately, the compatibility will vary depending on the specific valve. Explore the CU4 Series - Valve Control Units for controls with direct connect or AS-i connection. Visit the SPX Flow website for more information: https://www.spxflow.com/assets/original/apv-cu4-as-interface-atex-zone-2-gb.pdf.</p>

            <p>The black module located in the head, which I believe used to be known as APV valves, can be ordered separately. The ASI module is a black component with built-in sensors and adjuster screws for position adjustments. It features a connector block for sensors and solenoids, as well as a 2-pin block for ASI connection. Direct connect heads are likely similar to ASI heads, but with different wiring consisting of +V, -V, two sensor wires, and a solenoid wire. Consider reaching out to the supplier for pricing on the direct connect heads, which may also be APV valves. It is important to note that using an ASI valve in place of a standard one may require disconnecting sensors and solenoids and making appropriate connections. Due to potential space constraints, standard proximities may not fit in the ASI head. As I am retired and no longer have access to valve heads, testing the signals or wiring is not feasible. Consider swapping out heads with direct connect ones if needed.</p>

            <p>As mentioned previously, the ASI power typically ranges from 25-30 volts DC on the 2-wire bus. However, I have not yet tested the sensors or solenoids, so there may be additional voltage information on the valves. If your system already has ASI installed, consider using a meter to check the sensor outputs and the voltage powering the solenoid for optimal performance.</p>
