            <p>The PanelView Plus is equipped with an Ethernet port, making it compatible with other devices using Ethernet such as PLCs. This allows for easy connectivity to remote locations with just the necessary cabling.</p>

            <p>You can activate the "VNC" feature on your PanelView Plus for remote viewing of terminal screens from a regular computer in a control room. Typically, A-B controllers can easily connect to multiple PanelView Plus terminals. It is important to exercise caution when dealing with boiler control systems and seek advice from the OEM and plant management regarding any direct control concerns.</p>

            <p>Operaghost mentioned that the PanelView Plus is equipped with an Ethernet port. If both the current PanelView and PLC are utilizing Ethernet, then only additional cabling to the remote site would be necessary. Thank you, Operaghost, for the advice. I will give it a shot.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach mentioned that your PanelView Plus may support the option to enable "VNC" for remote networked monitoring of terminal screens from a standard computer in a control room. Most Allen Bradley controllers can easily connect to multiple PanelView Plus terminals. It is important to exercise caution when dealing with a boiler control system and to seek advice from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and plant management regarding any line-of-sight control concerns. So, it seems we may not need to invest in another Panel View. Connecting an ordinary PC monitor to the current Panel View should suffice for remote surveillance.</p>

            <p>The remote viewer feature is initially turned off as a default setting. To activate it, you need to access the current panel, close the runtime, and then enable the remote viewing function. It may be necessary to restart the panel after enabling this feature, although I am unsure as it has been some time since I last did this task. All you need is a VNC viewer installed on your PC. I recommend using TightVNC for optimal performance.Download TightVNCTightVNC - Reliable VNC-Compatible Remote Desktop Softwarewww.tightvnc.com</p>

            <p>In response to Ken, Salahuddin Ahmed expressed gratitude and noted that an additional Panel View may not be necessary for remote monitoring. Instead, connecting an ordinary PC monitor to the existing Panel View would suffice. However, it is recommended to use a full PC running VNC for optimal remote monitoring capabilities.</p>

            <p>Robertmee is indeed correct. To remotely access the field panel views for operating filter presses, you will require a PC within the same subnet running VNC viewer software. In a setup I implemented for a previous client, the control room operator had a designated PC with preconfigured VNC shortcuts for each filter press, totaling around 12 views.</p>

            <p>When utilizing VNC Viewer for a boiler system, it is crucial to restrict installation to essential and authorized personnel. Restrictions on system access may apply to ensure compliance with safety regulations and boiler license agreements. It is advisable to consult with safety, engineering, and review your boiler license agreement to prevent any potential issues with state inspectors. Be proactive in addressing any limitations on remote access to the system to avoid any violations.</p>
