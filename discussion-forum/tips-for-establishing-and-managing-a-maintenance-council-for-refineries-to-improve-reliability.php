            <p>Hello AbuAhmed, I believe implementing an asset management council is a fantastic initiative that highlights its significance within your organization. To maximize its effectiveness, I recommend facilitating a decision-making framework within the council and consistently incorporating opportunities for improvement and progress in the agenda. It is crucial to avoid allowing the council to become consumed with mundane operational matters and instead focus on reaching consensus on key strategic issues. This will ensure that the council remains productive and impactful in driving organizational success.</p>

            <p>To optimize your TPM Planned Maintenance Council, it is crucial to clearly outline the roles of your council members, establish its purpose, and identify key metrics for tracking progress. Initiate a strategic planning session with your maintenance leaders to align on goals and objectives. Best of luck with your endeavors. Warm regards, Rolly Angeles.</p>

            <p>Hello AbuAhmad, 

I am pleased to inform you that we have established a Maintenance Process Owners Group for a prominent multi-Platform O&G production company. Just as Daryl mentioned, this group is dedicated to addressing key issues that impact Reliability and Integrity, along with addressing common challenges. These include establishing standardized terms and definitions, benchmarking, pooling resources, and sharing insights from both failures and successes. 

Thank you for your interest in our group.</p>
