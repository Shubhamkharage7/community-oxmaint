            <p>It seems like my 1958 Corvette, equipped with twin 4-barrel carburetors, was experiencing issues due to a gummed-up float valve in one of the carburetors. Despite replacing all fuel filters and flushing out the fuel lines, the problem persisted, which was incredibly frustrating. --------------------------------- Victor E Rioli --------------------------------- Original Message Original Message: Date: 05-30-2023 Time: 08:31 Subject: Engine Troubles The truck is having trouble starting as it only runs briefly after using starting fluid. I checked the fuel line by the rail and confirmed that the pump is operating and delivering a good flow of fuel. I ran a diagnostic scan with an OBD scanner, but at one point, lost communication with the PCM. The scan provided limited information. Sent from my iPhone</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why does my truck start with starting fluid but stalls shortly after?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Starting with starting fluid indicates a potential fuel delivery issue, which could be related to the fuel pump or fuel system components.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I troubleshoot a fuel pump issue in my truck?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: You can disconnect the fuel line near the rail to verify if the pump is functioning properly and check for a consistent flow to ensure proper fuel delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  What could be the reason for losing communication with the PCM while scanning the OBD system?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Losing communication with the PCM could be due to connection issues, faulty OBD scanner, or potential problems with the PCM itself.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4.  How can I address the lack of information received when scanning the OBD system?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: To address the lack of information, ensure proper connection between the OBD scanner and the vehicle, and consider checking for any error codes or diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that may provide more insight into the issue.</p>
