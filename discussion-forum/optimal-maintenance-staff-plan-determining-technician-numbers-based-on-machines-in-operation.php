            <p>A few years ago, I undertook a thorough process that proved to be quite time-consuming but essential for proper maintenance planning. This process entails meticulously identifying all equipment, systems, and spaces in need of maintenance. By identifying maintenance tasks such as PM, PdM, repairs, mods, and customer calls, along with their frequency and estimated labor hours, you can calculate the total labor hours required. Adjusting this number for technician wrench time efficiency is crucial. To determine the actual labor hours contributed by an employee, start with 52 weeks multiplied by 40 hours, deducting non-working time like vacation, sick days, training, and company meetings. This will give you the labor hours per employee per year. By dividing the maintenance hours required by the labor hours per employee per year, you can estimate the number of technicians needed for the job.

Setting up a CMMS or work order system plays a significant role in this process, as it involves tasks like equipment identification, task identification, and labor hour estimation. If you're short on time, consider visiting www.ifma.org to order their benchmarking research report, which provides valuable insights into facilities maintenance costs and staffing requirements based on square footage. Another helpful resource could be RS Means Facilities Maintenance and Repair Cost Data, although the most recent version may need to be sought out. Good luck on your maintenance planning journey!</p>

            <p>Determining the appropriate number of personnel is not a one-size-fits-all process. It involves industrial engineering techniques such as time studies. Understanding wrench-time concepts and ensuring planners are familiar with personnel qualifications and task completion times based on experience levels are essential. Conducting a thorough RCM analysis and identifying critical equipment within your facility can provide valuable insights to establish the optimal number of personnel needed to effectively run your program. This approach, when executed correctly, can be a great starting point in workforce planning.</p>
