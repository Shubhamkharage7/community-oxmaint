                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>At the outset, I acknowledge the universal aversion to addressing safety inquiries directly. However, I seek guidance and definitive responses supported by references. My first query concerns a machine equipped with a light curtain for operator loading. The machine frame rises 2 feet from the ground before featuring a sizable opening large enough for potential entry. The light curtains detect intrusion into the load area and trigger the safety circuit, cutting power to an indexer and pneumatics. Can the light curtain automatically reset upon the operator's exit, or is manual intervention necessary? The second question pertains to a 2ft x 2ft opening outfitted with a light curtain that deactivates power when breached, ensuring safety within the immediate vicinity. Nevertheless, unauthorized entry permits access to powered devices beyond the initial breach point. Clarification on these scenarios is elusive despite my thorough search for relevant information.</p>

            <p>1) Most safety standards require a manual reset for a safety trip, although some systems automatically reset a safety communications fault under specific conditions, such as when an AGV passes through a known roaming area. This decision places the responsibility on the system itself.

2) When a light curtain protects a large area, the entire area must be deactivated in the event of a hazard. If the hazard involves a small opening, the entire safety zone should be shutdown unless additional light curtains are used to segment the area. However, this scenario can pose a potential nightmare if someone resets the machine while someone is in the crawlspace.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my view, in scenario 1, a manual reset of the light curtain safety circuit would be necessary if someone manages to bypass the light curtain and enter the machine. If the system resets automatically and the person gets through the light curtain, they could end up inside the machine. In scenario 2, it is important to assess the potential dangers posed by each accessible device for operators who may crawl into the machine.</p>

            <p>I would like to mention a small side note regarding machine safety protocols. The reset function is crucial for ensuring the operator can verify the area is clear of any tools or people before resuming operations. It is recommended that reset buttons are positioned in a way that allows the operator to have a clear visual of the entire machine area. For larger machines with multiple access points, it may be necessary to have two reset buttons that need to be pressed. In some cases, machines may even require both buttons to be pressed simultaneously, especially if there are two operators involved. Consider the example of large press machines that necessitate two buttons to be pressed at once for operation. Cognex and Keyence are reputable companies that offer a wide range of safety devices and solutions for enhancing workplace safety. Explore their offerings for innovative ideas on improving machine safety.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Our system features two reset buttons for each door to ensure operator safety. The inside button is pushed, the door is closed, and then the outside button is pressed, all within a specified time frame. This process serves as a reminder for operators to confirm that the area is clear. The light curtains, which operators reach through, require manual resets. Some machines are divided into zones, and if moving parts breach these zones, they are automatically reset unless the operator's light curtain is also breached simultaneously, in which case a manual reset is necessary. Additionally, small areas within the light curtains are safeguarded with horizontal light curtains that are linked to the ones operators reach through, necessitating a manual reset.

In our latest systems, we have implemented area scanners to ensure that no one is inside before the doors can be reset. In my personal opinion, it is advisable to mandate manual resets for light curtains and other presence sensing devices such as horizontal light curtains or area scanners to confirm that the space is clear. If manual resets are not feasible, the dual reset button approach (inside and outside the protected area) can be considered along with mandatory manual resets for every operation.</p>

            <p>I implemented a safety relay with a two-handed start button to serve as a reset mechanism for operators loading a machine's light curtain station manually. Our facility had numerous two-handed start stations strategically placed to ensure operators were in a safe position when initiating the machine. The redundant light curtain was an additional safety measure to prevent any mishaps while operators were reaching into the mill. This setup successfully passed our thorough risk assessment process.

In the realm of safety regulations, it is imperative that safeguards are put in place to prevent potential energy hazards. Power to drives should not be abruptly cut off to avoid long-term damage; instead, safety-rated STO signals should be utilized, which applies to robots as well. Certain inputs may still have power, such as stack lights in specific scenarios. Failure to reset a tripped light curtain, allowing movement without proper safety protocols, should raise a red flag.

My experience predates the introduction of safety PLCs, requiring us to manually configure safety mechanisms to eliminate potential energy when entering a work zone. This included pneumatics releasing air, spring return valves maintaining valve positions, motor brakes automatically engaging in case of power loss, ensuring all hazardous elements were rendered safe upon entering the work area.

Understanding and adhering to relevant safety standards is crucial in the industrial sector. The following codes and standards such as NEC, NPFA70, CEC, IEC, NFPA, UL, CSA, and ISO provide comprehensive guidelines for integrating safety measures into machinery design and operation. By consulting these standards, one can ensure compliance and mitigate risks effectively.

Furthermore, various ISO standards like ISO 12100, 13849-1, 13850, 14119, 14122, 14122, 13857, 16092, 20607, 22400, 4413, 4414, 13849-2, 16092-1, and 16092-2 offer specific guidelines on risk assessment, machinery safety design, emergency stop functions, safeguarding devices, access to machinery, safety distances, performance indicators, hydraulic and pneumatic system safety, and validation of control systems for enhanced safety in industrial settings. Adhering to these standards ensures a systematic approach to safety implementation and reduces the likelihood of accidents or injuries.</p>

            <p>Your post lacks detail and raises many questions. If you are able to bypass a light curtain or safety barrier to access a running machine, then the machine is not adequately protected. Even with blanking capabilities, a large gap in the light curtain is not permissible. In all the machines I have designed, a manual reset has always been necessary. Please provide more information about the type of machine, the positioning of the light curtain relative to the loading area, and the nature of the large opening. Additional details are required for a clearer understanding. Regards, James.</p>

            <p>nmurray pointed out that the machine frame is built from the ground up, rising 2 feet before featuring a spacious opening large enough for someone to crawl inside if determined. This opening measures 2ft x 2ft and is equipped with a light curtain that is triggered when entered, cutting off power to the machine for safety. However, once inside and further along, there are devices that remain powered, posing a potential hazard.

Crawling into the machine for tasks such as cleaning, inspecting, or troubleshooting is not classified as an emergency but rather a service entry. In such cases, a Lock Out Tag Out Try Out (LOTOTO) procedure is essential to ensure the area is completely isolated from energy sources. Automatic reset features are risky, especially in scenarios where a person can crawl deep into the machine.

During the machine's cycle, sensors perform checks to ensure parts are properly positioned before clamps secure them and the indexer begins to move. It is crucial to consider the risk of parts falling onto an individual inside the machine, even with energy isolation in place, particularly if the parts are held in position by force.

It is important to note that these comments do not serve as comprehensive safety training, and a thorough risk assessment should be conducted by a safety professional. In the event of any accidents, it is crucial to have written confirmation from management regarding safety decisions related to the machine to avoid potential legal ramifications in the future.</p>
