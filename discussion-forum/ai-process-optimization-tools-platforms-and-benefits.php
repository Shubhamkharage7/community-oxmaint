            <p>I rely on GPT for Game Master prep in my Pathfinder campaign, but I wouldn't trust it with industrial processes. It was a challenge to restrict it to using only uploaded documents as source material, as it tends to generate hallucinatory "ideas." Perhaps in the future, AI will assist me in my work, but GPT-4o isn't up to the task (although it's great for Excel macros).</p>

            <p>The term AI may not be quite right for what I'm discussing, as it's more likely about machine learning. Imagine a scenario where a machine is producing various widgets, each with different recipe parameters. Traditionally, skilled operators adjust these parameters to achieve the desired widget outcome. But what if we could collect all running parameters and widget quality metrics to enable the machine to learn the optimal settings for producing the best widgets over time? Could an algorithm predict which parameters to adjust if a batch of raw material doesn't yield good widgets with the standard settings? This task may not be suited for a PLC system. I vividly recall the shift from analogue controls to computer systems and used to say that computers may not surpass the skills of the best operator, but they will always outperform the worst operator. Could machine learning potentially exceed the capabilities of even the best operator?Nick</p>

            <p>AI has been a buzzword for quite some time. In the 1980s, there were tools known as "optimizers" that could analyze lumber blocks to determine the most profitable way to cut them. These tools compared prices for different sizes and grades, showing that a single 2x8 plank was often worth more than two 2x4 planks of the same length. Fast forward to today, where neural networks (NN) are being trained using vast amounts of data and employing gradient descent methods. The increase in processing power has allowed for more sophisticated algorithms and the development of efficient machines, like Delta Motion's french fry defect removal equipment.

AI technology now has the ability to analyze images, such as determining whether a 256x256 picture features a dog or a cat, showcasing the vast potential of modern AI systems. However, the key to optimizing production lines lies in using timing diagrams and parallel processes, as demonstrated in saw mills and veneer mills that have been utilizing optimization strategies for years.

While chatbot technology like Chat GPT can sift through large amounts of data, the true challenge lies in optimizing processes effectively. Despite the advancements in AI, it is essential to remember that perfect results are not guaranteed, but AI systems can outperform a vast majority of individuals.

In recent times, Gradient Descent (GD) has gained attention as a useful optimization tool. While there are numerous tutorials on platforms like YouTube, real-world applications require a deeper understanding of the technology. Academic institutions often introduce new concepts, but it is important to focus on practical applications to deliver meaningful results.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Peter Nachtwey has expressed his viewpoint that AI is often overhyped and that the technology has evolved significantly since the early 1980s, when algorithms such as optimizers were used to determine the most efficient ways to cut lumber for maximum value. Back then, computer processing power was limited, resulting in only moderate success with programs like chess and reversi.

Today, neural nets are trained using vast amounts of data and sophisticated methods like gradient descent, requiring substantial CPU power. Companies like Delta Motion have leveraged this technology to develop advanced defect removal machines, using powerful processors like the 64 core AMD thread-ripper for efficient operation.

Modern AI applications can now accurately classify images, such as distinguishing between dogs and cats in 256x256 images. Production lines benefit from traditional methods like timing diagrams to optimize efficiency, with the slowest machine often dictating the overall speed. Parallel and asynchronous routines, supported by tools like PLC SFC charts, enhance operations and productivity.

Saw Mills and Veneer Mills have long been optimized using various techniques, with projects like staggering multiple lines to minimize oil use achievable without specialized AI. While tools like Chat GPT can analyze data, they may not necessarily optimize processes.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of AI technologies will surpass that of most individuals, but it may not be flawless. Gradient descent, a key optimization technique, has limitations when applied to complex systems, as highlighted by real-world data analysis challenges. The quest for better techniques and the questioning of academic practices are ongoing themes in the realm of AI and data analysis.</p>

            <p>Discussing AI can be complex as it encompasses various technologies like machine learning, neural networks, and chatGPT. There is a skepticism towards the process optimization aspect of AI, with many viewing it as a trendy buzzword exploited by consultants. ChatGPT, in particular, is criticized for its limited ability to truly comprehend language, despite its usefulness in generating summaries. While some believe that unconventional programming methods, such as AI, could be beneficial in industrial settings, others see it as an early form of machine learning. Siemens, for example, has successfully implemented AI to improve quality checks in manufacturing processes, reducing the need for additional expensive equipment. This innovative approach highlights the potential of AI in revolutionizing traditional industries. However, the debate remains whether the cost of implementing AI outweighs its benefits. The evolving field of AI continues to present new opportunities for businesses, and companies like Siemens are at the forefront of this technological revolution.</p>

            <p>The Manglemender application offers excellent features for optimizing control processes. Sharing your experience with this project can be both educational and beneficial. Your goal should be to develop a formula that effectively manages whatever Manglemender is controlling based on the suggested items. So, Manglemender, what exactly are you controlling? Your aim should be to achieve optimal results and collect data accurately. The key concept is to minimize a cost function, typically involving the sum of squared errors between the desired goal and the actual outcome. This process is similar to auto-tuning a SOPDT temperature system, where data on time, control output, and temperature are collected and analyzed to create a model that accurately predicts the temperature based on time and control output. By using algorithms to find the model coefficients that minimize errors, you can achieve a more efficient control system.

For example, I utilized Ron Beaufort's Hotrod data to determine the SOPDT model for the "Hotrod" temperature system. This involved identifying open-loop gain, two time constants, dead time, and ambient temperature. In the video, Peter demonstrates how simple it is to use system identification techniques with real data to minimize errors and improve accuracy. Now, Manglemender should focus on recording data and establishing a cost function to optimize the control process effectively.</p>

            <p>I am just starting out on this journey and am looking for experienced individuals to share their insights. In my role at an OEM machine builder, I specialize in serving industries such as printing (specifically wallpaper), atmospheric coating, vacuum coating, and heat exchangers. Over the past 3 years, I have been heavily involved in developing battery products for clients and have witnessed the dedication required to understand complex processes. I am now eager to explore ways to enhance and expedite process development.

My main focus is on model-based control for optimizing operational efficiency. I strive to anticipate the necessary actions and prefer to operate in an open loop control system. By calculating predicted torque for drive systems and feeding this information forward to the drive, I can achieve smoother tension control in web transport systems. While I may not be actively programming as much these days, I am always looking for ways to enhance control mechanisms.

Thank you for your insights. I may be traveling for the next two weeks, but I will be sure to continue this discussion upon my return.</p>
