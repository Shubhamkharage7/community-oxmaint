            <p>I once utilized ACLT to develop numerous templates for various devices such as PLCs, I/O cards, and motor starters. Unfortunately, the company I was employed at went out of business a few years ago, resulting in the loss of these templates. I will search for them on a USB drive and share them once I locate them, but I am currently away from home and it may take some time.</p>

            <p>If you have purchased a license for AutoCAD Electrical, it is important to address any software issues you may encounter. AutoCAD Electrical (ACADE) offers a comprehensive set of features compared to the limited capabilities of AutoCAD LT. In my past experience, working with a limited number of ACADE licenses sometimes required me to receive files from AutoCAD LT users to complete certain commands that were missing in the LT version.

While EPLAN is considered to be superior to AutoCAD Electrical, the latter is often more cost-effective. Despite the challenges I have faced in my 11+ years of using AutoCAD Electrical, I appreciate its capabilities compared to basic 2D CAD software.</p>

            <p>For years, we relied on AutoCAD at my previous workplace until they introduced us to DraftSight. However, we encountered issues with block definitions and shape files not functioning correctly, so we were allowed to continue using AutoCAD. At my current workplace, we have transitioned to BricsCAD, which is similar enough to AutoCAD to be seamless. While I primarily design panel layouts in Inventor, I now also create a quick 2D version in BricsCAD for our team to use during panel construction. I am considering using SkyCAD but will need to check with IT to ensure compatibility, as they have become stricter with software installations.</p>

            <p>joseph_e2 mentioned how they have been using AutoCAD for years at their previous workplace, finding it to be a reliable tool, especially when equipped with a variety of templates and symbol blocks. Transitioning to CAD Profi electrical six months ago has been a positive experience, with its extensive symbol library for IEC & NFPA standards and user-friendly customization options. The software also offers automatic symbol numbering and layer management features.

In terms of panel layouts, joseph_e2 prefers using Inventor but also quickly creates a 2D version in BricsCAD. It's worth noting that CAD Profi supports multiple CAD software options, including BricsCAD. For more information on CAD Profi Electrical and its compatibility with various CAD programs, visit their website: https://www.cadprofi.com/main/en/products/cadprofi/cadprofi-electrical.

            <p>Agreed on the use of terminals. It has been a lengthy process for me to master creating precise terminal strips in AutoCAD Electrical, overcoming challenges during my free time. While AutoCAD Electrical streamlines many tasks once configured, the initial setup and learning curve can be cumbersome. I believe creating terminal strips in regular CAD would be daunting, which is why I persisted with ACADE, despite the steep learning curve. It shouldn't have taken me years to grasp how to accurately create terminal strips in ACADE. If your projects are small and infrequent, and you don't require BOM reports, AutoCAD Electrical may not be necessary.</p>

            <p>Last year, I purchased a license for SEE Electrical, a cost-effective software with a panel layout plotting feature. However, I later discovered that there is an extra charge for accessing their parts library, which includes manufacturer-specified terminal layouts and dimensions. The process to pay for this additional feature seemed complicated, so I have decided to work without it for the time being.</p>

            <p>If your company does not have specific standards for Autocad Electrical in place, Autocad LT is a better option. For those looking for similar functionality at a lower price, Draftsight is a great alternative.
