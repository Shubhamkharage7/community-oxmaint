                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>| Check out the document attached (2). I am seeking assistance in addressing an issue of unstable vibration in the air fans at a waste water treatment facility. The system consists of 3 belt-driven air fans with a motor speed of 1470 RPM and fan speed of 820 RPM (overhung fan). After collecting vibration data on December 11, 2023, I found that 2 out of 3 fans exhibited high vibration levels, with amplitudes around 10 mm/s in the motor and 7 mm/s in the fan bearings. The FFT analysis revealed a predominant frequency of 820 CPM in both motor and fan bearings, indicating a possible unbalance issue. I performed balancing on December 12, 2023, which temporarily reduced the vibration levels to around 3 mm/s and 2 mm/s in the fans. However, the vibration amplitudes started increasing again with a dominant frequency of 820 CPM after a day of operation. Despite cleaning and replacing filters, checking mounting locations, and confirming damper positions, the issue persisted. Subsequent tests on December 16, 2024, showed vibration levels of around 16 mm/s (motor) and 8 mm/s (fan) with the same dominant frequency. Even after attempting to balance Air Fan 1 with a correction mass of 170 grams, the vibration levels fluctuated, reaching as high as 12 mm/s within a couple of days. It is important to note that the fans draw air from the atmosphere and discharge gases from the waste water, resulting in wet fan impellers during operation. The housing may contain water during start-up, which the client drains before starting the fans. Your insights on the attached data would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Dear Harout,

The impeller on the fan rotor resembles a typical fan design. I doubt that water could accumulate during regular operation as the impeller was clean and free of debris. The equipment seemed to balance well after the initial correction mass was applied and ran smoothly. It's worth noting that both fan vibrations spiked simultaneously on December 12th, indicating an anomaly in the process that I have yet to pinpoint.

RE: Unstable Vibration in Air Fan @ Waste Water Plant

Hi Shanmuga,

I would appreciate your assistance in resolving an issue with unstable vibrations in the air fans at the waste water treatment plant. Specifically, I am interested in the shape and design of the fan impellers. Are there any areas where dirt, debris, or water could collect within the impellers?

Best regards,

Hi,

I am reaching out for support in addressing unstable vibration concerns with the air fans at our waste water treatment facility. We have three belt-driven air fans with a motor speed of 1470 RPM and a fan speed of 820 RPM. After noticing high vibration amplitudes on two of the fans on December 11, 2023, I suspected an imbalance and conducted rotor balancing. Although the vibration initially decreased after balancing, it began to rise again the following day. Despite cleaning filters, replacing damaged ones, and checking mounting locations and damper positions, the issue persists.

Further tests on December 16, 2024, showed increasing vibration amplitudes, even after re-balancing Air Fan 1. It appears that the wet conditions of the fan impellers due to the enclosed operation may be contributing to the problem. I have attached the data for your review and insights.

            <p>Hi Shanmuga,

I have a few more questions regarding the unstable vibration issue with the air fans at the waste water treatment plant:

1. Process abnormalities: Have there been any abnormalities in the process? Specifically, have you checked the suction and discharge pressures/flows, and temperatures? Do these parameters vary significantly during operation?

2. Damper Operation: Are the dampers in the system fixed or variable? Please measure the vibration while adjusting the damper settings to observe any effects on vibration levels.

3. Structural looseness: Have you thoroughly inspected the entire structure for potential looseness or cracks?

4. Equipment History: Can you provide any failure history for both the motor and the fan? Have any previous corrective actions, such as machining or other repairs, been taken?

5. Past behavior: What was the condition of the machine in the past, especially before your recent intervention? How was the fan behaving prior to the current issues you are addressing?

Thank you,

Unstable Vibration Issue in Air Fan @ Waste Water Plant

Dear Harout,

The impeller is designed like a typical fan rotor, and there doesn't seem to be any water accumulation during normal operation. The impeller was clean with no debris found. One interesting point is that both fan vibrations increased simultaneously on December 12th. There seems to be something abnormal related to the process that I am unable to identify.

Unstable Vibration Issue in Air Fan @ Waste Water Plant

Hi,

I require your assistance in resolving an unstable vibration problem with the air fans at a waste water treatment plant. Here is some information about the equipment:

- Air Fans
- Number of Fans: 3
- Equipment type: belt-driven
- Motor Speed: 1470 RPM
- Fan Speed: 820 RPM (overhung fan)

On December 11, 2023, I observed high vibration levels in two out of three fans, leading to suspicions of unbalance. After balancing the rotor, the vibration amplitudes decreased but then started increasing again with a predominant frequency of 820 CPM. Despite cleaning filters and checking dampers, the issue persists.

Further details and data are attached for your review. Please share your thoughts on the matter.

            <p>I encountered a similar issue with a fin-fan cooler in Oman, where despite repeated fan balancing, vibration amplitudes continued to increase. Eventually, a colleague used sand bags to alter the structure's natural frequency, effectively eliminating the vibration. My recommendation for your unstable vibration issue with air fans at a waste water treatment plant is to conduct a bump test at the motor support structure. I suspect you will discover a natural frequency at fan speed, indicating a need to adjust the mass or stiffness. Can you provide details on the fan impeller design and any areas where dirt or debris may accumulate? This information will help diagnose the root cause of the vibration problem.</p>

            <p>Shanmuga, I have a suggestion - was the fan/motor frame isolated or secured during the initial balance process? Based on my experience with fans mounted on isolation, failures can occur and result in similar issues to what you are experiencing. I recommend locking down the frame and checking for balance, making necessary corrections. If the machine is located on the ground floor, isolators may not be necessary as they are typically used to isolate machine vibrations from the surrounding area. An easy test involves placing wooden wedges next to the isolators while monitoring vibration. It is likely that vibration levels will decrease as the failed isolator is blocked with the wedge. Keep in mind that machine isolators have a limited lifespan and can deteriorate due to conditions such as rusty springs or degraded rubber. It is advisable to inspect these components and replace them if necessary, or remove them entirely. G Kaiser.

            <p>► Monitor the fan geometry for any signs of deformation while in motion. Additionally, conduct a vibration test by removing the impeller to identify the source of the rattling noise. For optimal performance, ensure that the fan impellers are free from pockets or areas that may accumulate dirt, debris, or water. 

Dear Shanmuga, I am seeking assistance in resolving an issue with unstable vibration in air fans at a waste water treatment plant. The equipment consists of three belt-driven air fans operating at a motor speed of 1470 RPM and a fan speed of 820 RPM (overhung fan). Despite performing rotor balancing to address suspected unbalance, the vibration amplitudes continued to rise, indicating a recurring issue. The fans draw suction from the atmosphere and have multiple filters in place. 

Efforts to clean and replace filters, adjust mounting locations, and check damper positions yielded no improvement. Despite intermittent operation, the vibration levels remained high. Further attempts at balancing the fans saw temporary reductions in vibration amplitudes, only for them to increase again shortly after. The wet conditions of the fan impellers due to the enclosed operation and water in the housing during startup may be contributing to the issue. 

Attached is the data for the fans for your review and feedback. Kindly share your insights on how to address this ongoing vibration problem.

            <p>The data sheet indicates that the motor experiences the highest vibration, not the fan bearings. This suggests that the peak speed of 820 RPM corresponds to the fan speed. If this is the case, why is the motor vibration higher than the fan bearings if fan unbalance was initially suspected as the cause? One factor that was not mentioned is the condition of the pulleys. It is important to ensure that both the drive and driven (fan) pulleys are concentric and not bent, as any anomalies in this component could potentially transfer vibrations to the motor. Additionally, it is crucial to check that the motor foundation is securely in place.

Unstable vibration issues with air fans in a waste water treatment plant are causing concern. Despite performing balancing on the rotor, the vibration amplitudes continue to increase, with a predominant frequency of 820 CPM. Cleaning filters, confirming damper positions, and intermittent operation have not led to improvement. It may be beneficial to consider the wet conditions in the fan housing and the drainage process before starting the fans. Checking the concentricity of the pulleys and the stability of the motor foundation could also help address the vibration issues. Feel free to review the attached data and provide your insights. Thank you.</p>

            <p>The entire system is housed within the same frame on the first floor of a building, mounted on vibration isolators to prevent transmission of vibrations. It's not surprising to observe increased motor vibration, given that both systems share the same frame and the motor lacks proper support. Since the vibration frequency matches the fan's, motor issues have been ruled out. A solo run test by the client also showed minimal vibration levels. The fan pulley is not suspected as the vibration returned to normal after balancing. Similar symptoms in Fan 1 and Fan 3 confirmed pulley eccentricity. Could the rotor balance out and show normal vibration if the pulley is eccentric? Why does the vibration fluctuate over time? For resolving unstable vibration in air fans at a waste water treatment plant, it's crucial to check for pulley condition and ensure a secure motor foundation. Following the gathering of vibration data on all three fans on December 11, 2023, subsequent actions were taken to address the issue, including rotor balancing and fan cleaning. Despite these efforts, vibration levels continued to increase, indicating a persistent problem that requires further investigation and intervention.</p>

            <p>It appears that the entire system is mounted on a single frame, which may contribute to the higher vibration observed at the motor compared to the fan bearings. It is essential to monitor both the magnitude and phase of the vibration. Any changes in the system, either in the force or response, should be carefully observed. During the balancing process, it is crucial to note if the correction weights were placed in the same position or not. It is also important to check if the phase changes while collecting data and if it changes over time. Inspecting the impeller and frame support system for cracks is recommended. Additionally, using a strobe light to check for abnormal motion of the shaft, pulleys, and belts can provide valuable insights. Consider the previous history of the fans - have they been running smoothly before experiencing issues? Checking the condition of the snubbers supporting the system is also advised to ensure they are not worn or improperly adjusted..*;

            <p>Shanmuga, Your provided information has sparked further inquiries due to the various balancing efforts and water presence in the air fan system. One possible solution could involve removing the belts and conducting a static fan balance check and correction to align with an 820 RPM wheel. However, it's crucial to note that balancing may not eliminate non-mass center related forcing functions. It might be advisable to keep the housing drain slightly open during operation to prevent the fan from acting as a pump. Consideration for the fan's overall performance and efficiency is critical in resolving the unstable vibration issue in the waste water treatment plant.+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-++-++-+-+-+-+-+-++-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-Mike Barkle****************************************************************************Contact: SHANMUGA SUNDARAM PACKIRISAMYSent: 01-09-2024 15:05Subject: Unstable Vibration in Air Fan @ Waste Water PlantGreetings,I require assistance in addressing an unstable vibration problem with the air fans at a waste water treatment facility.Key information regarding the equipment includes:- Air Fans: 3 in total- Equipment Type: Belt-driven- Motor Speed: 1470 RPM- Fan Speed: 820 RPM (overhung fan)The issue arose on December 11, 2023, when vibration data was collected showing high amplitudes in motor and fan bearings.

In response to your query regarding unstable vibration in the air fans at a waste water treatment plant, I suggest performing a static fan balance check and correction by removing the belts. This method should help achieve balance, particularly with an 820 rpm wheel. It's crucial to address any forcing functions that may not be related to the mass center aligning with the center of geometry. Additionally, consider leaving the housing drain slightly open during operation to prevent the fan from turning into a pump.

            <p>Hello Shanmuga,

I have a few questions regarding the unstable vibration issue in the air fans at the waste water treatment plant:

1. Is there any debris present in the wet airstream?
2. Did the problem start on December 11th?
3. Can you control the motor speed using a variable frequency drive? If so, does the imbalance improve? Is the issue only present at 820 fan speed?
4. Is the fan blade hollow foil? Could it have holes, cracks, or welds that allow water or debris to collect in the blades?

Hi Shanmuga,
I attempted a static unbalance check before the first balancing attempt by removing the belts, and there was no static unbalance in the system. The housing drain was kept open, and the water was pumped out during startup. I don't think there was any water in the fan housing during normal operation.

Hi,
I need help resolving an unstable vibration problem with air fans at a waste water treatment plant. Three air fans are belt-driven with a motor speed of 1470 RPM and fan speed of 820 RPM. On December 11, 2023, vibration data showed high amplitudes, suspected unbalance, and performed rotor balancing. Despite cleaning filters and checking mounting locations, the issue persists.

Please see the attached data and share your insights.

            <p>When troubleshooting unstable vibrations in an air fan at a waste water treatment plant, it is crucial to consider potential issues such as a loose foot or insecure sheeve. The vibrations may be caused by the entire frame vibrating at fan RPM, but it is more likely due to a loose foot on the motor or pillow blocks. Performing a static fan balance check, especially after multiple balancing attempts and water presence in the system, can help pinpoint and correct any unbalance issues. Additionally, maintaining an open housing drain during operation can prevent the fan from functioning like a pump. For further support in resolving vibration problems in air fans, reach out for expert assistance.</p>

            <p>Hello Shanmuga,

After reviewing all the comments and responses, it appears that you have covered a lot of troubleshooting options for the issue at hand. Drawing from my experience with fan unbalance and related vibrations, here are my insights:

When it comes to vibration analysis, simplicity is key. Overcomplicating things can lead to analysis paralysis and steer us off course. Keeping it simple means trusting and relying on your vibration data. High readings at 1x frequency usually indicate unbalance issues (around 90% of the time). The focus should be on understanding what is causing this unbalance.

In your case, for overhung fans, if it's purely an unbalance issue, the highest readings should be in the Axial direction on the fan pedestal bearings. Since this isn't the case here, it's important to concentrate on the factors contributing to the unbalance rather than solely focusing on balancing the fan itself. It seems unlikely that the issue lies with the balancing process.

Possible underlying causes could include: 
i) Foundation
ii) Resonance
iii) Temperature variations during operation

It's recommended to closely examine the foundation, even if the rubber mounts appear to be in good condition externally. Consider motion amplification to observe relative movement. Conduct a bump test to rule out resonance issues. Investigate if temperature fluctuations or process changes are affecting the equipment.

Given the gradual increase in vibration/unbalance over one to two days, it wouldn't hurt to double-check the alignment, specifically the pulley alignment.

Ahmad Kidwai

Subject: Unstable vibration in Air Fan @ Waste Water Plant

Hi,

I require assistance in resolving an unstable vibration problem with air fans at a waste water treatment plant.

Equipment:
- Air Fans
- Number of Fans: 3
- Equipment type: belt-driven
- Motor Speed: 1470 RPM
- Fan Speed: 820 RPM (overhung fan)

Issue:
On December 11, 2023, I conducted vibration measurements on all three fans. Two out of three fans exhibited high vibration amplitudes of around 10 mm/s in the motor and 7 mm/s in the fan bearings. FFT analysis revealed a predominant frequency of 820 CPM in both the motor and fan bearings. Suspecting unbalance, I balanced the rotor on December 12, 2023, resulting in vibration amplitudes of approximately 3 mm/s and 2 mm/s in both fans.

However, within a day of operation, the vibration amplitudes in both fans started increasing again, with 820 CPM being the dominant frequency. Despite cleaning and replacing filters, as well as checking mounting locations and damper positions, there was no improvement.

On December 16, 2024, vibration amplitudes in both fans measured around 16 mm/s (motor) and 8 mm/s (fan), with the predominant frequency still at 820 CPM. Despite operating the fans intermittently and monitoring vibration levels, the issue persisted.

As a next step, I attempted to balance Air Fan 1 by adding a correction mass of 170 grams. This temporarily reduced the vibration to 4 mm/s in the motor and 2 mm/s in the fan, but the amplitudes once again escalated to around 12 mm/s within a couple of days.

Additional Details:
- Suction for the fans is from the atmosphere, minimizing wear.
- Discharge is for removing gases from wastewater, causing the fan impellers to be constantly wet.
- Water accumulation in the housing during startup is drained by the client before operating the fans.

Attached is the data for these fans. I would appreciate your insights on this matter.

            <p>Hello Shanmuga,

I recently encountered a similar issue with our hood exhaust fan, and I believe there may have been a misdiagnosis of the problem. Prior to balancing on 11/12/2023, the axial reading on the fan was unusually low for an overhung fan, indicating that the main issue may not have been an unbalanced force. It is crucial to recognize that attempting to balance a fan without addressing the underlying forcing frequency can lead to recurring problems. I have dealt with a resonance issue in the past, and while balancing initially provided results, the problem resurfaced in a more pronounced manner after 24 hours of operation, mirroring your current situation.

To address the problem effectively, it is essential to conduct additional tests to rule out structural looseness and resonance as potential issues. A balanced fan should not become unbalanced unless external factors like dropped weight or debris accumulation occur during operation. Also, consider monitoring the vibration amplitude post-balancing, as it may increase over time.

To eliminate resonance and structural looseness, consider the following steps:
1. Analyze the waveform of the spectrum to gain insights.
2. Vary the speed if possible and monitor the resulting vibration amplitude. For unbalance, the amplitude varies with the square of the speed, while resonance will cause drastic changes in amplitude. Structural looseness, on the other hand, may not significantly impact the amplitude.
3. Conduct a bump test if you have the necessary equipment.
4. Inspect the structure and reinforce the support around the motor.

I hope these suggestions help in resolving the issue with the air fans at the waste water treatment plant.

            <p>It appears that there may be a resonance issue with the fan volute panels, possibly due to their composition being fiberglass/composite in a water treatment setting. Considering the corrosive nature of the process, it is likely that the repeated balance failures are a result of a natural frequency problem. As suggested earlier, it would be wise to inspect the condition of the anti-vibration feet and assess the structure of the volute for any signs of flexing.

It seems like you might have misdiagnosed the vibration issue with the air fans at the waste water treatment plant. Before the balancing, the axial reading was unusually low for an overhung fan, indicating that the problem may not be related to unbalanced forces. Balancing a fan without addressing the underlying resonant frequency could lead to temporary results, as experienced firsthand. To rule out structural looseness and resonance, conduct additional tests and analyze the spectrum waveform. Varying the speed and performing a bump test, if possible, can help pinpoint the root cause of the vibration issue.

In summary, it is crucial to address potential resonance and structural issues to ensure the fans operate smoothly. By conducting thorough testing and analysis, you can identify and resolve the underlying problems causing the unstable vibration in the air fans at the waste water plant.</p>

However, within a day of operation, the vibration levels started to rise again, with a dominant frequency of 820 CPM.  
The client cleaned and replaced all filters, checked the mounting locations, and confirmed the damper positions were correct, but the issue persisted.  
Further testing on December 16, 2024, showed vibration levels of approximately 16 mm/s (motor) and 8 mm/s (fan) with the same dominant frequency of 820 CPM.  
Repeated attempts at balancing Fan 1 by adding a correction mass of 170 grams temporarily reduced vibration levels, but they increased again within a day.  
Some key points:  
- The fans intake air from the atmosphere, so minimal wear is expected.  
- The fans discharge gases from waste water, leading to wet impellers during operation.  
Please review the attached data for these fans and provide your insights.

            <p>SHANMUGA, I have reviewed the "before" and "after" balance files for Fan #1 and Fan #3 in detail. It appears that both fans transition from balanced to out-of-balance around the same time. Are all three fans mounted on the same suspended (isolated) platform base? Additionally, please clarify the motor speed of each fan and whether they operate at a 50 Hz or 60 Hz Line Frequency. Do all three fans run at the same speed of 820 rpm? Is there any issue with Fan #2, or is it not in use at all? It would be helpful if you could provide waveform and spectrum data from both motors. Thank you, Ralph.

            <p>Hey Shanmuga, When dealing with the sudden increase in fan vibrations post-balancing, it's essential to consider common process factors. Have you looked into dampers / actuators? Make sure to confirm if everything is functioning normally post-balancing. In the past, I've experienced issues where balancing was done, but changes occurred when dampers were later opened down the line. Just a suggestion to consider. Best regards, Colin

Subject: Unstable vibration in Air Fan @ Waste Water Plant

Hello, I'm seeking assistance to address the unstable vibrations in air fans at a wastewater treatment plant. 

Equipment: Air Fans
Number of Fans: 3
Equipment type: belt-driven
Motor Speed: 1470 RPM
Fan Speed: 820 RPM (overhung fan)

Issue: On December 11, 2023, vibration data was gathered on all three fans, revealing high vibration levels in 2 out of 3 fans - around 10 mm/s in the motor and 7 mm/s in the fan bearings. FFT analysis indicated a predominant 820 CPM in both motor and fan bearings. Suspecting unbalance, rotor balancing was performed on December 12, 2023, reducing vibration amplitudes to approximately 3 mm/s and 2 mm/s in the fans. However, vibrations increased again within a day of operation, with a dominant frequency of 820 CPM. 

The fan takes in atmospheric suction and has multiple filters. Although the client cleaned and replaced filters, checked mounting locations, and confirmed damper positions were correct, there was no improvement. On December 16, 2023, vibration levels were measured at approximately 16 mm/s (motor) and 8 mm/s (fan) with the predominant frequency still at 820 CPM. Despite operating fans intermittently and monitoring vibration levels, no significant improvement was observed.

To address the issue, balancing was attempted on Air Fan 1 by adding a correction mass of 170 grams, temporarily reducing vibration to 4 mm/s (motor) and 2 mm/s (fan). However, vibrations increased once again, reaching around 12 mm/s after a couple of days. Notably, as the fans draw in atmospheric suction, minimal wear is expected. The fan impellers remain wet due to the enclosed operation, with water in the housing during startup, drained by the client before fan operation. 

Please review the attached data for the fans and share your insights.
