            <p>I don't have any specific references, but do you have a specific question in mind? It seems like you already understand why you want to do it. Just remember, nothing comes for free. Field weakening, which involves reducing the field current in a shunt wound DC motor, results in decreased field flux and back EMF as the armature rotates through the field. By lowering the field, the motor can operate at higher speeds by reducing the back EMF at any given speed. The achievable speed is largely determined by the field current; for example, a motor capable of running at 2000 RPM with full rated field current can reach 4000 RPM with half the field current. Other factors may limit the maximum speed achievable.

However, torque in a DC motor is generated by the interaction of the shunt field and armature field. If the shunt field current is decreased, the armature current must increase to maintain the same level of torque. Therefore, there is a practical limit to how much the field current can be decreased for a given load.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick response, Keith. The motor specifications I have are as follows: Armature current of 163 Amps FLA, operating at 500 VDC, Field current of 300 VDC at 5.63 Amps, Base speed of 650 RPM with a maximum speed of 1950 RPM. The customer requires the motor to operate mostly within the range of 650 to 1950 rpm.

I have a few questions regarding this setup:
1) What is the minimum armature voltage at which field weakening should commence? My assumption is that field weakening should start around 400 or 450 volts, considering the armature voltage is 500 VDC. This leaves only 100 or 50 VDC to control 60% of the speed range, which concerns me.
2) How reliable is speed control when field weakening is in operation?</p>

            <p>Last night, I came across my old notes from a previous D.C. Drive class I attended a few years ago. Among my scribbles was a reminder: "Avoid lowering the field without full armature voltage to prevent unexpected issues." Seeking further explanation on this topic.</p>

            <p>Any modern digital drive manufactured within the last 15 to 20 years should have the capability to automatically configure itself for field weakening. It is important to have a feedback device connected to the motor when utilizing field weakening to ensure safe operation. While it is possible to operate without a feedback device, it is strongly recommended against. Essentially, the motor will reach a voltage of 480 to 500VDC on the armature before field weakening is initiated. The motor operates in constant torque mode from 0 to base speed with full field, and switches to constant horsepower mode from base speed and above.</p>

            <p>As previously mentioned, it would be surprising if your drive does not automatically handle this task for you when instructed. Although the basic concept is simple (reduce the stator field intensity to increase speed), the process can be quite complex. The drive must adjust multiple variables simultaneously to achieve the desired outcome. It is important to ensure that your load is suitable for field weakening, especially if you are aiming to operate at three times the base speed. Keep in mind that running at such high speeds will result in a reduction of torque at full speed. Center driven winder manufacturers can effectively utilize field weakening, as it allows for constant horsepower operation. On the other hand, for applications like conveyors where the load remains constant at all speeds, field weakening may not be as effective unless the motor is already oversized in terms of torque.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the type of drive being used? Any digital drive manufactured within the last 15 to 20 years should have the capability to self-configure for field weakening. It's highly recommended to have a feedback device, like an encoder, linked to the motor when implementing field weakening for safety reasons.

Typically, you would aim to reach 480 to 500VDC on the armature before beginning the field weakening process. In this case, a 100 HP PowerFlex DC drive from AB is being utilized for a steel coil slitting application where field weakening will be applied to the recoiler drive.

Stay tuned for updates as the setup is scheduled for this afternoon. Remember, safety is key when implementing field weakening techniques.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Hello everyone! I have successfully implemented field weakening in my drive, and here are some key takeaways from my experience. Field weakening should begin near the peak armature voltage (500 VDC in my case, specifically 475 VDC). When utilizing field weakening, it is important to note that armature feedback cannot be used; instead, I employed an optical encoder for feedback. The implementation has been smooth and seamless, with stable speeds even within the field weakening range. Thank you to everyone who provided assistance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In an active field regulator drive, setting up field weakening allows for speed control through the armature voltage until reaching the field weakening point (approximately 475VDC). At this point, speed control transitions to the field regulator, maintaining higher speeds by keeping the armature voltage nearly constant and achieving overspeed by decreasing the field current.</p>

            <p>Widelto shared his experience of converting his drive to field weakening, highlighting the significance of using separate feedback elements such as an optical encoder instead of armature feedback. This ensures stable speed control even in the field weakening range. Modern drives have made this process easier, but it's crucial to consider safety implications, especially when manipulating field control at high speeds. Back in the analog days, tachless crossover controls were used, but they proved to be less reliable and more costly compared to systems with a separate feedback mechanism. Field control in newer drives offers improved safety measures and accurate speed regulation even during field weakening. DC machines have always excelled in providing extended speed control through field weakening, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of their design.</p>

            <p>I'm a bit unclear about what happens during E-stop situations according to your description. It depends on how E-stop affects the circuit, but it seems to me that connecting a brake resistor across the armature and applying full field would result in braking torque exceeding full capacity. This torque can be adjusted by varying the size of the resistor. Is there something I'm overlooking here? 

Additionally, there is a way to implement field weakening without dealing with the complexities of the "crossover point." Instead, you can set the field at a permanently weakened (lower) current level. This adjustment will broaden the armature voltage's speed range up to the maximum speed achievable with field weakening. The downside is a reduction in available torque across all speeds, but the simplicity of this method eliminates the need for speed feedback.

The assertion that working with a DC machine is straightforward didn't resonate with me as I've always seen it as a risky endeavor, akin to taming a caged tiger. The main concerns for me are the potential for speed runaway and armature explosion in the event of field loss, as well as the high energy stored in the field that could lead to a dangerous discharge if the field circuit is accidentally disconnected (an experience I've had). Personally, I prefer the predictability and safety of an AC induction motor, where speed correlates closely with frequency and where any motor lead disconnections result in only a minor arc.</p>

            <p>DickDV expressed confusion about the implications of E-stop conditions described by rdrast. The scenario involves a 500V motor operating at 650 rpm, with its field weakened to reach 1300 rpm, causing the motor to run at twice its base speed. If full field current is then applied at 1300rpm, the back EMF will increase to 1000V. Consider the possible outcomes if the motor were running at 2600rpm and the potential impact on the control electronics. Safety measures might be necessary in such a situation. Does anyone have a fire extinguisher handy?Nick</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Manglemender mentioned the scenario where a 500V motor with a base speed of 650 rpm is field weakened to 1300rpm, running at 2 times the base speed. If full field current is applied at 1300 rpm, the back EMF will rise to double the base speed voltage, reaching 1000V. The question arises, what would happen if the motor were to run at 2600rpm? Furthermore, what potential impact could this have on the control electronics?

The issue highlighted here is one that is often overlooked by many individuals. Designs that prioritize fast stops on ESTOP by applying full field for a duration can lead to detrimental consequences such as blown up components and the need for commutator replacements. It is crucial to control the rate of field rise within safe limits, a practice that modern drives emphasize through feedback mechanisms.</p>

            <p>After examining the issue of the CEMF surpassing the rated armature voltage, it is evident that this scenario does not occur as rapidly as previously implied. This is because the CEMF does not reach 500V at full base speed. Instead, it is typically around 300VDC, taking into account armature amps and resistance. Therefore, with a 500V armature, it is possible to operate at speeds 1.67 times higher than the base speed before encountering issues with CEMF exceeding the voltage rating. While operating at double or triple base speed may pose a problem, this aspect had not been considered until now. Your insight is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I want to express my gratitude to those who participated in this discussion regarding my steel coil slitter application. In the past, using separate power sources for armature and field voltage was nearly impossible due to the need to adjust the recoiler speed accurately as the diameter increases. However, I have managed to make this work effectively by utilizing a formula I found in a previous forum thread. Unfortunately, my customer purchased the wrong motor, requiring me to switch from base speed to field weakening. While I would have preferred a larger drive and motor with base speed, I had to make adjustments based on financial constraints. I value the recommendation provided by Rdrast and will be implementing it closely. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Bill, just so you know, the type of winder you mentioned is commonly referred to as a "CEMF" winder, known for its exceptional performance. The only downside at the moment is the higher cost of the motor compared to a straight armature winder. However, if you already have the motor, you're good to go.</p>

            <p>A winder requires a constant power application, with a high speed at the start diameter and low torque, transitioning to low speed and high torque at the final diameter. This characteristic allows for field weakening to reduce the motor size. Without field weakening, the motor would need to match the speed and torque requirements at both ends, resulting in a much larger motor and drive. Similar constant power principles can be applied to an AC vector drive. Last year, I installed a 100KW AC motor and drive for a steel slitter, and it operates smoothly.</p>

            <p>During my various travels and interactions with customers who disregard the field requirements outlined by design engineers, there is often a moment of silence when I inquire gently, "What was your thought process behind this decision?" One of the most common misconceptions about weak field operation is the belief that increasing the speed of a motor will solve the problem. While it may indeed result in a speed increase, this advice is more apt for a motor operating without any load on the armature. Weak field operation, on the other hand, occurs when the current rating falls significantly below the minimum stated on the nameplate. As long as you stay within the manufacturer's specified values, you can avoid weak field operation. To put it simply, my advice to customers is this: if you require more speed, consider purchasing a faster motor or adjusting the gearbox accordingly. I could recount numerous alarming stories about customers running 1,500HP d/c motors in steel mills in tandem with reduced field current, only to be puzzled by the arcing of brushes. However, that discussion will have to wait for another time.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am looking for information on how to calculate the Minimum Level of Field Weakening in a DC Motor. The variables I have are Armature Voltage (750), Base Speed (160), Max Speed (360), and Field Current (380). I need to determine the Flux of the DC motor during field weakening. Specifically, I am looking for the Field Current at 40%, 70%, and 90% of the Flux level. If anyone has the formula for this calculation, please share it with me. Thank you.</p>
