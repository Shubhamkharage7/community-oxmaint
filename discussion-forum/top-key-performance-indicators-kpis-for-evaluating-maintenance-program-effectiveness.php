            <p>Thank you, Terry, for establishing this dedicated forum focused on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Your ability to select engaging topics has truly invigorated this forum and encouraged active participation. KPIs play a crucial role in maintenance management, aligning with the concept of "Begin with the end in mind" as advocated by Stephen Covey. It is essential to measure what we manage, as emphasized by an influential management guru (an American, whose name escapes me at the moment). While three KPIs may be a starting point, it is important to recognize that multiple KPIs work together harmoniously. I have shared several KPIs, and I look forward to hearing from others about their preferences.</p>

            <p>One of the critical factors contributing to downtime in manufacturing is the technical failure rate compared to the expected need. This refers to the unexpected halting of machine operations due to electro/mechanical issues. It does not account for operator errors, insufficient materials, utility outages, or environmental factors causing stoppages. Quality-related stoppages are considered if they affect the end product's quality.</p>

            <p>Effective monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is crucial for our clients. These metrics play a vital role in assessing service levels. Tabs Systems utilizes custom priority levels to determine KPIs and SLAs, which can be tailored to meet each client's specific needs. By using these priorities, we can estimate the time needed for both response and completion of tasks. Any tasks that surpass or are close to exceeding the designated times are promptly identified and tracked through various reports and tools, such as a Digital Dashboard. Our range of tools empowers clients to track their performance levels, enabling them to promptly address high-priority tasks and maintain a high standard of customer service.</p>

            <p>Three key performance indicators (KPIs) that we focus on are total maintenance cost, reactive maintenance percentage of hours, and preventive maintenance (PM) compliance percentage. Total maintenance cost is a crucial bottom line measure of our maintenance efficiency. Reactive maintenance percentage of hours represents work that was not planned and scheduled in advance, such as emergency work completed within 5 days of work order entry. This metric also captures non-emergency work that is expedited beyond normal timelines. PM compliance percentage, also known as the PM Commitment metric, is essential for any Reliability Program as it drives PM optimization and ensures commitment to scheduled maintenance tasks. This metric is used to track our adherence to preventive maintenance schedules. What are your thoughts on these KPIs?</p>

            <p>I completely agree with MarkD's top 3 KPIs. In addition to comments, it is crucial to establish a targeted range for the total maintenance cost KPI, such as 1 to 3 percent of the capital replacement value annually. This range helps prevent both over-maintenance and under-maintenance, ensuring optimal asset management. It is important to monitor this KPI throughout the asset life-cycle, from initial production to decommissioning, in order to minimize the impact of staff changes.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Utilizing Maintenance Costs as a Percentage of Replacement Asset Value (RAV) can be challenging when trying to ensure accuracy. While it is possible to use plant construction costs and index them annually with relevant indices, obtaining a reliable RAV number can be complicated, especially for older plants. However, getting the numbers right can be beneficial as it allows for maintenance cost adjustments based on inflation without changing the KPI. Finding the appropriate indices can be difficult, but using them effectively can serve as a benchmarking tool for similar industries. Ultimately, the key to determining the right maintenance costs lies in managing risks and performing maintenance tasks at the optimal time. By prioritizing this, maintenance costs can be effectively controlled. Josh, how have you determined the RAV numbers that best suit your plant's needs?</p>

                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>28-09-2024</span></li>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When analyzing performance, it is crucial to consider whose viewpoint we are adopting. While top management and their financial analysts focus on metrics such as cost performance %RAV, budget variances, and unit costs, it is important to remember the competitive nature of the marketplace. In a scenario where demand exceeds supply, revenue stream and availability become more significant than cost KPIs. However, it is essential to recognize that reliability and productivity are the key drivers of availability and costs. 

Therefore, at the operational level, our focus should be on managing compliance, maintenance (PM and CM), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for reliability, and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for productivity. By prioritizing these factors, we can improve reliability, increase availability, and indirectly enhance productivity. Monitoring trends in these metrics also provides insight into potential cost implications and revenue generation.

It's worth noting that different perspectives may lead to alternative strategies, all of which could be valid. Ultimately, the combination of these key performance indicators offers a comprehensive view of the overall business performance.</p>
