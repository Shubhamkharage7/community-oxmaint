                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have noticed an issue with employee entries in our system. Deleting an employee results in their name being replaced in all workorders by the next alphabetical employee on the list. This has caused confusion, with a supervisor being incorrectly credited for work from a former employee. To address this, we now use the "shift" value as a filter to identify our current employees. Is there a more effective solution to this problem? Feel free to share any suggestions. Thank you, Jack.</p>

            <p>Preserving the work order history is crucial in maintaining a comprehensive record. When removing an employee, it is important to ensure that their history in the work order system remains intact. If the employee is still associated with open work orders or assigned tasks, MP2 will prevent deletion through the system, requiring manual deletion in the database. However, this method is not recommended.

An effective way to manage this is by implementing a filter on Shifts. One suggestion is to preface former employees' names with "ZZ-" and create a filter to exclude any entries starting with "ZZ-". This approach facilitates quick identification of former employees when their names appear on work orders, ensuring clarity for all team members.

It would be helpful to know the version of MP2 you are currently using.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, Jonathan. We are currently using the "access" version of our software. I have chosen not to update to the newer version, as it appears to have fewer features. Unfortunately, I believe we may have lost some of our data history in the process. Another issue we have encountered is that when an employee is deleted, the next person in alphabetical order is automatically assigned to their tasks.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After thorough comparison, I have found that the Access version does not lack anything present in the 6.0 or 6.1 versions of MP2. While there may be some new features in newer versions, I advise sticking with what works well for you. As the saying goes, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." If you encounter issues in the Tasks section, the best course of action is to review the tasks table and reassign any tasks assigned to the user you intend to delete before proceeding. It may not always be advisable to delete an employee, as the separation of the Employees table and Users table serves a purpose. Users can be easily deleted when no longer needed, as their User ID is only linked to software access. On the other hand, employees listed in the employee table are meant to remain intact and should not be deleted under normal circumstances.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you're looking for a way to manage employee data without deleting anyone, consider this solution: modify the class field in the labor table by renaming it to "current employee" and assigning either a Y or N to each individual. Then, on the work order labor tab, create and save a filter with the criteria "current employee equals Y." This will display a current list of employees without impacting your work history. I hope this tip proves helpful. Best regards, Jennifer.</p>
