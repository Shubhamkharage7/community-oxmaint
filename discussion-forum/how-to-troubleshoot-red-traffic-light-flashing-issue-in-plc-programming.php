                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently a student exploring PLC programming and getting familiar with RSLogix5000. I am working on a traffic light project that utilizes a single timer. The project is successful in creating a flashing advanced green light using the ACC.9 command. However, I am facing challenges in making the red lights flash when the process is not running, potentially due to an outage. Despite trying various approaches, my classmates and I are struggling to find a solution. I suspect the PRE command might be the key, although I have limited experience with it. Any advice or guidance on how to achieve this would be highly valued. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Greetings and welcome to the forum! Can you clarify what you mean by "process is not running"? Are you referring to the PLC not being in RUN mode? Please provide your code for further assistance, preferably in a PDF format of the ladder diagram as not all users may have access to RSLogix5000. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

            <p>To enhance your understanding of TON/TOF/RTO instructions, I recommend exploring the different components they offer. By doing so, you can discover how to make lights flash when your timer is inactive. Additionally, you will gain insights into Pre, ACC, DN, and TT. Consider using multiple timers, as this may better align with your instructor's requirements.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In order to optimize traffic flow, I implemented a night-mode setting on the traffic light system from 23:00 to 05:59. During this period, I activate a Night-Mode function and pause the main cycle timer. Instead, a separate timer is used to alternate flashing the red and yellow lights. If you require a 4-way red light system for your project, consider adjusting the outputs to utilize CallForNSRed and CallForEWRed bits during night-mode. After both sections, monitor the bits to control the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) red lights. A key modification I made was delaying the start of night-mode until the lights are in sync, and ending night-mode by resetting the timer to a specific value for a smooth transition back to normal operation.</p>

            <p>Implementing traffic lights in RSLogix is a common task, especially for beginners. There are multiple approaches to achieving this task, and it is important to understand the specific requirements and guidelines provided by your instructor. By clicking on any instruction in RSLogix and pressing F1, you can access detailed information about how the instruction functions, the inputs it requires, and the outputs it produces. Understanding how these components interact is essential for successful implementation. If your goal is to control the traffic lights using a single timer, you may find helpful resources within the software. Traffic lights provide a practical introduction to sequential logic, and if you are unfamiliar with the concept, consider researching "grafcet" for more information.</p>

            <p>When teaching the Traffic Light simulation in class, I always strive to identify the top-performing student. To do so, I present various sets of timer instructions for the project: SIX timer instructions, Three timer instructions, One timer instruction, or NO TIMER INSTRUCTIONS - which will depend on the PLC used. It's been some time since I last taught this, so there may have been Four timer instructions instead of Three, but the concept remains the same.</p>
