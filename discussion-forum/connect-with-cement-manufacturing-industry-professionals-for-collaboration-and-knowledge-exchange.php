            <p>Hello, I have experience working with cement, and while I may not have the time to personally mentor you, I believe this message board can offer valuable guidance. Working in a cement environment involves exposure to fine dust and large machinery, which is common in industrial settings. It is essential to adhere to tolerances, specifications, and standards to ensure safe operations. A reliable lubrication program and thorough root cause analysis are crucial, especially in the initial phases of working in this environment.</p>

            <p>Hello Jonny, it's great that you've put forward this proposal. I would like to suggest that we start by sharing our own experiences with the cement plant. While I am relatively new to the industry, I have noticed some problematic areas with the ID fans. These fans tend to have higher vibrations than usual, even after attempting to balance them. For example, we balanced one fan using single plane balancing, as it has a thin rotor, but the vibrations continued to fluctuate between the two sides. We ended up leaving the amplitudes at 5mm/s on both sides. Can anyone provide insights on how to best balance the fan? Is 2-plane balancing a suitable approach in this case? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Frequently, the vibrations we experience on our primary ID fan are a result of debris accumulating on the impeller, which we regularly remove through shot blasting. Our other fans have also presented issues, primarily stemming from improper installation causing them to shake violently. Currently, our main focus is deciding how to proceed when a fan bearing fails.

            <p>Jonny, you've brought up some important points regarding bearings, and it seems like you're in search of the most durable option to avoid failures. If vibration is causing these failures, it might be worth exploring ways to control vibration levels to address the root of the problem. Coatings for the fans could be a solution to prevent build-up and handle heat effectively. I gained experience implementing a vibration program at a cement plant in Iowa, where we faced similar challenges with material build-up and fan wear. Although I now work in the nuclear industry, I recall that they installed an air horn to combat build-up issues. Wishing you success in resolving these challenges!</p>

            <p>Yes, we do offer an air purification system that effectively removes contaminants from the air. However, we have noticed that the vibration levels are not as desired. Recently, we encountered an issue with the NDE bearing of one of the fans experiencing a sudden increase in vibration amplitude, leading to the discovery of a cracked cage. We believe that the high vibration levels were the cause of this damage. Even after replacing the bearing, the vibration levels did not decrease as expected. Can you provide any recommendations or solutions for addressing this issue?</p>

            <p>Jingas, could you please share the spectral data related to the fan bearings? It's possible that by analyzing this data, we could identify any other underlying issues that may be present. This information will be crucial in diagnosing and addressing any potential problems.</p>

            <p>Regrettably, our vibration analysis software currently lacks the capability to generate spectra.

            <p>Jonny, we're facing the same challenges. I'm tasked with creating a program, but my time is limited due to a long list of other tasks demanding attention. To maximize efficiency, I suggest we collaborate on a standardized calendar where we can each prioritize tasks specific to our plants. Determining the frequency of vibration analysis is crucial. Drawing from my experience at a thermal power station, they conducted analysis as follows: Turbogenerator sets weekly, Boiler feed pumps every fortnight, ID fans, FD fans, PA fans also every fortnight, and Gearboxes every fortnight. We can tailor our calendar similarly based on equipment criticality. This will serve as our initial strategy before exchanging data on troublesome machines. On a different note, does anyone know if there are specific factors to consider when driving a 3000rpm fan with belts at a 1:1 pulley ratio?</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>We have encountered the recurring issue of ID vibration multiple times, despite identifying build-up and bearing clearance as potential causes. The problem persisted, especially after operator changes, until we pinpointed the root cause - the damper opening degree. Through testing, we confirmed that vibration levels ranged from 6.2 mm/s at 0% to 0.6 mm/s at 100%. 
In a similar situation, I am also pressed for time to develop a program with numerous other tasks at hand. To streamline the process, I suggest collaboratively creating a standard calendar and individualizing it based on specific plant needs. Frequency of vibration analysis, as seen in my previous experience at a thermal power station, varied for different equipment such as turbogenerator sets and gearboxes. Developing a similar calendar tailored to equipment criticality will serve as a foundation. Once established, we can exchange spectra data for problematic machines.
On a separate note, I am curious about the considerations for a 3000rpm fan powered by belts with a 1:1 pulley ratio. Is there a specific factor to keep in mind in this setup?</p>
