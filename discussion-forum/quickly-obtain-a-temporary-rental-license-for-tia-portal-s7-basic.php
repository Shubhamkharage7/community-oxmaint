                    <p>My friend is facing a challenge with an outdated S7-200 machine that has suddenly malfunctioned. In order to resolve this issue, he has acquired a new S7-1200 and is now seeking a skilled programmer to help set it up. Unfortunately, I personally have a preference for other brands and lack a Siemens license. Nevertheless, I have the logic prepared and just need to create the program. Despite my attempts to obtain a trial license, I have encountered difficulties in the process. I have learned that I can opt for a temporary rental license from Siemens for a specific duration. Is it possible to purchase this option over the weekend? Time is of the essence in this situation, as my friend's customers are awaiting a resolution.</p>

            <p>While I have limited experience with TIA Basic, I recommend downloading TIA V19 professional for a trial license. This will allow you to explore the features and capabilities of the software firsthand.</p>

            <p>It's important to mention that the V memory area found in the S7-200 is not present in the S7-1200. As a workaround, you can utilize M flags with different addresses or create a Datablock with matching names to the V area. Additionally, when re-coding S7-200 timers, consider using IEC timers and use the S7-200 timer number as the instance DB name. For guidance on how to adjust S7-200 time bases, refer to the S7-200 programming documentation for detailed instructions.</p>

            <p>L D[AR2P#0.0] mentioned that they have not used TIA Basic before, but suggested that by downloading and installing TIA V19 professional, users can obtain a trial license. It seems like V19 is the latest version now, although some users may still be familiarizing themselves with V18 for their projects.</p>

            <p>It appears that License Step 7 Basic was not located. There may not be a "demo/trial" version available for Basic, but Pro as LD suggested can be used instead. Pro offers the same software functionality and is fully compatible. Visit SIOSsupport.industry.siemens.com for more information.</p>

            <p>One of my acquaintances is facing issues with an old S7-200 machine that has ceased to function. In order to replace it, he has acquired a new S7-1200 but requires assistance with programming it. However, I, personally, have a preference for different brands and do not possess a Siemens license. I have already prepared the logic for the new program, but I am unable to write it due to the lack of a valid license. Despite attempting to obtain a trial license, I have encountered difficulties as the prompt for activation does not appear upon installation. I have come across information about the option to rent a license from Siemens for various durations. I am considering the possibility of purchasing this rental license over the weekend, as time is of the essence with his awaiting customers. While it is encouraging that the trial license issue is being resolved, I am uncertain about the practicality of rental licenses. It seems that the Step 7 Basic software required for programming the S7-1200 is reasonably priced at a few hundred dollars, making the rental option more suitable for accessing higher-end software packages like Professional for models such as the 1500 series. There is a potential for digital delivery with a quick turnaround time of 24 hours, but there have been instances where orders were delayed due to distributor processing times.</p>
