                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>A few days ago, I mistakenly activated an always-off bit in my programming. This bit was originally set up as a single Output Unit (OTU) on a rung and was being utilized as XICs throughout the code. While I could easily switch the bit on and off, I encountered difficulty when trying to do the same with a different bit set up in a similar manner. To address this issue, I made the decision to change the AlwaysOff bit into a constant to prevent any further occurrences.

Has anyone else experienced a situation like this before? --I eventually discovered that the bit was being used in an unscheduled program, allowing it to be toggled. Additionally, I became aware of this issue when the bit unexpectedly toggled itself on, which was quite perplexing.</p>

            <p>I consistently utilize a tool like this to guarantee that the signal is reset during each scan, similar to an AB OTU reset.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If a toggle is effective in altering its state and maintaining that state, the OTU is not in operation. Otherwise, the OTU should function with each scan and reset to zero. Ensure that the OTU logic is not contained within a subroutine. For tasks that are continuous, place the logic within this task, ideally as the first program below. Following this program, a Main routine should be present, ideally positioned within the initial one or two rungs of the routine (unless there is a fault routine). If the bit toggles itself on, another source may be writing to that bit. To investigate, right-click on the tag and choose Cross Reference. In the results, look for only one Destructive (Y) result, which will indicate your OTU. Multiple Non-destructive (N) results will signify XIC and XIO instructions related to the tag. Should there be more than one destructive result, further investigation is required.</p>

                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>10-08-2024</span></li>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Operaghost noted that if a toggle changes state and remains in that state, the Output Toggle Update (OTU) is not running. In that case, the OTU should execute with each scan and reset to zero. It is important to ensure that the OTU logic is not within a subroutine but rather in a Continuous Task, located in the first Program under that task. The Main routine should follow underneath, with the OTU ideally placed on the first one or two rungs.

If a bit toggles itself on, it may indicate interference from another source writing to that bit. To investigate this, right-click on the tag and select Cross Reference. Look for a single Destructive (Y) result, which should be your OTU, in contrast to the Non-destructive (N) results linking to XIC and XIO addressing the tag. If multiple destructive results are found, further investigation into their functions is necessary.

Operaghost shared an experience where toggling was possible due to non-destructive bits being utilized in an inhibited program. Once the program was uninhibited, the issue ceased. The cause of the self-toggling remains unclear as no other destructive bits were identified.</p>
