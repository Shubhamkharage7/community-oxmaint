            <p>Ensuring the number of modules matches the configured AENT chassis size in its non-volatile memory via a webpage is crucial to maintain a proper I/O connection between the AENT and the PLC. While the PLC's chassis size in its properties may differ from the AENT, adding a module to the IO tree will require the correct chassis size to be configured offline. It is important to note that exceeding the adapter chassis size may result in the "New Module" selection being disabled. Increasing the adapter chassis size is necessary to add more I/O modules successfully. Please refer to the manual for more detailed instructions on this process.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When attempting to add more modules than initially configured within the adapter chassis, the New Module option may appear dim and disabled. To enable the addition of more I/O modules, it is essential to increase the adapter chassis size accordingly. This suggests that having more slots configured in the adapter than in the program might not be feasible, as the New Module selection will be inaccessible.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Patrickmoneyy mentioned that the wording suggests it may be acceptable to have more slots configured in the adapter than in the program, but they may not be usable. So, if additional slots are added beyond the webpage configuration, it could potentially interrupt the I/O connection for existing modules. There are currently three Input and three Output cards that must remain functional even after installing the new cards.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to MagMonk, adding more modules beyond what is configured on the webpage may disrupt the I/O connection for existing modules. It is believed that the comparison between actual and configured modules only occurs at power up, so if the adapter loses power, the I/O connection will not be established. This information can be found on page 14 of the 1734-UM018 manual.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After returning to work, I conducted a test on my workbench. I discovered that adding cards to the chassis doesn't cause any issues, but power cycling the AENT can disrupt the I/O connection, resulting in a "Connection Request Error: Invalid Output Size." However, if you only install the base with a terminal block without inserting the card, the connection remains stable. This method could be beneficial if you wish to pre-wire field devices and add the cards later when making programming adjustments. It is important to note that the testing was carried out with an AENT Series B.</p>
