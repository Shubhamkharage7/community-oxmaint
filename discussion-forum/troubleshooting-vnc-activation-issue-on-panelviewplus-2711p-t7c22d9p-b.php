                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am in possession of an AB pvp31623, model 2711p-t7c22d9p-b, and I am currently attempting to activate VNC on my desktop. However, each time I try, it prompts me for a password and none of the passwords I have attempted have been successful. I have also observed that others facing this issue typically resolve it by going to desktop access and selecting "allow", but I am unable to do so as the button appears greyed out. Additionally, I am unable to toggle desktop access as it is currently stuck on disabled. How can I rectify this problem and enable desktop access? Despite attempting to reset the password and security question, the issue persists and I am unable to gain access to enable desktop access.</p>

            <p>Performing a factory reset is essential for resetting the password on your HMI, but it will also erase all data on the device. Therefore, I suggest proceeding with caution and having the firmware version, program, and configuration settings on hand before initiating the reset.</p>

            <p>The B Series PanelViews have encountered challenges with VNC functionality. If your firmware version is 12.102 or earlier, VNC cannot be activated. To enable VNC, upgrade to firmware version 12.105 or above. For steps on enabling VNC, refer to ID QA63564. We hope this information is helpful in resolving any issues.</p>
