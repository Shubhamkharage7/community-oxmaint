            <p>I recently had a minor setback with a new device after forgetting to disable BootP following an IP address configuration. This led to a unique error situation during the firmware download process. The device lost its IP address due to BootP still being enabled after the first power cycle, indicating that further updates were needed. After restoring the device to default settings, reconfiguring the IP address, and disabling BootP, I successfully loaded the firmware. However, an unexpected error occurred at the end of the process, although the CPU seemed unaffected. Despite troubleshooting efforts, the device would reset itself after running a program for varying durations, prompting me to exchange it for a replacement. This experience taught me the importance of caution during firmware updates, especially in relation to BootP. Note: The firmware version used was 17.5.60.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion. I utilized the serial port for uploading the firmware, which eliminated the need to manually set the IP address. The error occurs at the conclusion of the process, but the processor appears to be functioning properly. I have successfully uploaded a program onto it. I am interested in hearing if others have encountered this error and any potential explanations for its occurrence.</p>

            <p>For optimal performance, refer to knowledgebase AID 44379 for useful tips. Ensure that the power supply is located within 4 slots of the CPU and that the endcap is properly installed. If you are using a dual core processor, it is recommended to disable dual core functionality for controlflash operations. Launch the controlflash utility from the windows start menu and avoid starting it from within RSLogix5000. Note that switching to program mode may require power cycling the CPU, and customers have reported that the key must be in remote program mode. Check the ControlFlash log for any potential errors.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your assistance. The power supply is located next to the processor near the end cap. Currently, there are no I/O connections established. I did not attempt to activate the key switch in remote program mode, but I will try that next. The log file concludes with the following entries: On 08/26/10 at 07:19:00, there was a successful update where Instance = 3, Size = 2045916 bytes, Chunk Size = 256 bytes, Major Rev = 17, Minor Rev = 7. Shortly after, at 07:51:53, a reset failed with Error #11007, stating that the service cannot be performed while the device is in its current state. Further attempts at resets at various times were also unsuccessful due to the same error. However, at 08:23:38, there was a successful update where Instance = 65535, Size = 1572864 bytes, and a redundant update was bypassed. Unfortunately, there were more failed reset attempts due to Error #11007 and Error #11006.</p>

            <p>It seems that the laptop may enter power-saving mode after about 30 minutes of inactivity. In order to prevent this, it is recommended to periodically move the mouse pointer to indicate that the laptop is still being used. This small action can help avoid the laptop shutting off ports or activating the screen saver unexpectedly. Remember to stay attentive and interact with your laptop to ensure continuous operation.</p>

            <p>Gil47 noted that it takes approximately 30 minutes before encountering any issues. The issue may be related to the laptop entering power-saving mode, such as disabling ports or activating the screen saver. When dealing with flash control, it is important to intermittently move the mouse pointer to ensure the laptop remains active. I believe the update process is prolonged to almost an hour due to the serial connection I am using. I have disabled all power-saving features on the laptop to prevent it from entering sleep mode, although only the screen dims while the rest of the settings remain active.</p>

This can help ensure that your computer stays on and responsive when you need it. It's important to keep your laptop screen from turning off to maintain productivity and prevent interruptions to your work flow.</p>

            <p>By leveraging the boot firmware, you have the ability to easily configure the Ethernet port. Simply access it via RSLinx Classic, establish an IP address, and utilize the Ethernet port for swift firmware loading. This method significantly speeds up the process.</p>

            <p>After successfully upgrading the firmware via Ethernet, the process was quick and seamless. It is possible that the previous error was related to the serial port. This upgrade process was efficient and problem-free.</p>

            <p>While I may not have a technical background, the process of performing serial firmware upgrades is incredibly time-consuming, leaving ample room for errors to occur. As a result, we have transitioned to solely utilizing Ethernet upgrades after the initial couple of upgrades. During this process, I make sure to connect directly using a cross-over cable or a hub, eliminating any other devices that may be on the network to avoid potential complications.</p>

            <p>Facing the issue "Failed to begin update on the target device" while attempting to install Firmware v20.013.81 on the 1769-l24er-qbfc1b? The problem may arise if the target device is not in the correct mode for the update. To avoid this error, make sure to select the IP address with a single click and initiate the update without drilling down. Additionally, ensure that the bootp server is running while assigning an IP address via bootp to prevent update timeouts upon processor reboot. By following these steps, you can successfully update your device and avoid encountering any errors. Good luck!</p>

The target device is not in the proper mode to accept an update" while attempting to install Firmware v20.013.81, Carnivore_Medic shared their experience. Initially, they tried using both USB and Ethernet connections but kept encountering the same error. The problem stemmed from their old-school approach of navigating through the IP address to the backplane before selecting the processor. The correct method, as they discovered, was to simply single-click on the IP address and initiate the update without drilling down. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of assigning an IP address via bootp and ensuring the bootp server remained active to prevent the update from timing out upon processor reboot. By following these steps and leaving the bootp server running, Carnivore_Medic successfully completed the update. Good luck to anyone facing a similar issue!</p>

            <p>Encountering the error message "Failed to begin update on the target device. The target device is not in the proper mode to accept an update" while attempting to install Firmware v20.013.81? This common issue can be resolved by avoiding old school methods and instead easily selecting the IP address with a single click to start the update process. Ensure that the bootp server is still running after assigning an IP address to prevent timeouts during the processor reboot. By following these steps, you can successfully update your device. Good luck!</p>

            <p>While updating two L32E PLCs from version 20.13 to 20.18 using a laptop connected via Ethernet, I encountered the same error. Despite ControlFlash indicating the update had failed, the PLCs were successfully updated. Interestingly, when updating a PLC running on version 20.12 using the same method, no errors were encountered.</p>
