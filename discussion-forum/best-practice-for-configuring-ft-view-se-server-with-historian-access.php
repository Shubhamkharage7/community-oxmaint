                    <p>When configuring an FT View SE server, it is important to ensure access to the historian is available for data analysis. If you are unable to locate a client for historian access on the server, consider the possibility of it being located elsewhere for organizational purposes. However, it is recommended to also have a client on the historian server box for convenient access. Is this best practice for data management and analysis in FT View SE servers?</p>

            <p>To set up trends for clients accessing historical data, you must have a machine equipped with an SMT (System Management Tool). This tool should be included in the historian installation and be native to the historian system. With this setup, users can easily trend, add, delete, and perform other functions within the historian.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is recommended to restrict access to the Historian server to only those who manage its configuration. An option is to have a "client" such as FactoryTalk VantagePoint or Excel DataLink add-on for administrative use. In the past, Rockwell had a licensed OSI PI tool called 'Process Book', but its current availability is uncertain. The SMT tool mentioned by Ken is intended for administrator-level use. Our usual setup allows end-users to access data through FactoryTalk Directory member computers with VantagePoint, Excel DataLink, and/or TrendPro objects on SE graphics. Additionally, there are third-party client applications that can be configured to access Historian data.</p>
