                    <p>One of our Maintenance-Tips readers recently shared a concerning incident at their workplace involving an HVAC technician who used his hand to try to stop a large air handling fan, resulting in a severe injury. It is crucial to note that using hands to slow or stop coasting fans is no longer considered an acceptable practice, and it is against the policy in their workplace. Are there any recommended tools, devices, or methods that can be used to safely stop these loads? Additionally, what measures can be taken to prevent the load from rotating again? Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. - Paul</p>

            <p>According to discussions, it is commonly accepted and preferred to use a person's hand to slow or stop coasting fans. However, it is crucial to educate individuals on the proper safety measures and not resort to risky methods. Taking the time to prepare and think before acting is key in preventing accidents. Emphasizing safety awareness among employees and their supervisors is essential for avoiding incidents in the workplace. Prioritizing safety over speed is a must to ensure a secure working environment.</p>

            <p>Terrence, I have two questions that come to mind. Firstly, why is it considered unacceptable to let the fan come to a stop on its own? Is a few extra minutes of idle spinning really that crucial? Secondly, I struggle to comprehend why, in the 21st century, using a person's hand to slow or stop coasting fans is deemed the "acceptable and preferred" method. Who determines this? In the UK, any company advocating or implementing such a practice would face consequences from regulators. I would think that US regulators would uphold similar strict standards. If an immediate stop of the fan is necessary, consider using a shearable bar that is soft enough to not harm the blades - perhaps polystyrene bars could be suitable. Under no circumstances should fingers be used for this task. Vee</p>

            <p>It is concerning to think that some individuals let fear dictate their actions when trying to rush through a job, such as in the case of a man attempting to balance a two-ton wheel at a local motor shop. Unfortunately, accidents like this can occur when shortcuts are taken. This particular incident involved the man wrapping a sling around the spinning shaft to try and slow it down, which ultimately led to a dangerous situation. It is important to prioritize safety and avoid risky practices like this, especially when working with heavy machinery. Taking the time to allow equipment to come to a natural stop can prevent unnecessary accidents and injuries, ultimately extending your lifespan. Let's prioritize safety over speed in the workplace to ensure the wellbeing of all individuals involved.</p>
