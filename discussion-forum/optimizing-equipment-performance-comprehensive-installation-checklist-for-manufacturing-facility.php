                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>At our manufacturing facility, we are constantly updating and enhancing our machinery and procedures to meet the ever-growing demands of the industry. Our production lines are overseen by dedicated project managers and engineers who also serve as Line Supervisors. While our current equipment is still in its early stages of reliability testing, I am focused on managing the upkeep of our older machinery while the Line Supervisors are focused on implementing changes. To ensure the reliability of our new equipment, I have developed a comprehensive checklist for our Supervisors to follow. Your input and feedback on this checklist are greatly appreciated. This checklist is to be used before the installation of any new or replacement machinery. It includes important steps such as assessing the impact of potential failures on production time, determining the need for redundancy, monitoring the condition of the equipment, stocking spare parts and consumables, ensuring standardization of belts, motors, and gearboxes, preventing corrosion, maintaining service manuals, following OEM maintenance recommendations, conducting preventative maintenance, addressing safety concerns, providing necessary training for operators and maintenance staff, updating Supervisor Plans, integrating equipment into the maintenance management system, and coordinating with Controls Engineers for PLC integration. By following this checklist, we aim to optimize the efficiency and longevity of our equipment while minimizing downtime.</p>

            <p>Jack J, I really appreciate your insights and questions in this report. I have a few comments to add: in regards to points #6 and #7, was the equipment already bought at this stage? It is crucial to address these inquiries before purchasing in order to potentially standardize the equipment. However, it is still beneficial to bring up these points even post-purchase to spark further consideration. Additionally, point #9 suggests requiring PDF original versions over printed copies whenever feasible. PDF originals often include links and additional features that printed copies do not. Great work on this report. J-</p>

            <p>Jack, it's highly recommended to participate in the factory acceptance testing process prior to receiving the equipment. This proactive approach can help uncover potential issues early on. While I haven't finalized the standard operating procedure for a FAT, I have integrated various technologies such as vibration analysis, infrared, ultrasonic, and laser alignment tools. Being present on the factory floor has allowed us to identify and address several issues. For more information on my experience with factory acceptance testing, visit this link: http://maintenanceforums.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/2091034...461077862#1461077862.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing this valuable initiative. Upon review, I have identified three distinct phases in the process: 1) Pre-purchase evaluation of items 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, and 18. 2) The actual procurement process involving items 4, 5, and others. 3) The commissioning phase with focus on items 8, 14, and 16. The checklist, particularly useful during commissioning, simplifies the tracking of completed tasks. The rest of the process appears to be more like a detailed questionnaire requiring in-depth responses. I have attached a maintenance checklist that initially intimidated engineers but later became a sought-after tool, especially during project handover. For more information, please refer to the attached Mech_MasterCheck.pdf file (34 KB). Thank you for your attention to detail.</p>

            <p>This appears to be in good condition. Have you thought about the concept of 'hidden failure' and its implications? For example, when a component fails without being noticed by the operators during their regular duties. This is particularly crucial when it comes to safety interlock devices, as their failure can lead to severe consequences if not detected in time. It is essential to consider the normal operational environment of the machinery, especially if it is a backup system activated by a demand signal. What happens if the device sending the demand signal fails without being noticed? Does your maintenance routine include tasks aimed at uncovering hidden failures? Changes in operating procedures or staff reductions can increase the risk of hidden failures, therefore necessitating a reassessment of liability. Hidden failures and failure detection tasks play a vital role in establishing a maintenance program within the RCM framework.Best regards, Charlie.</p>

            <p>Jack, I also appreciate this app. I suggest emphasizing the significance of the lubrication survey and initial fill. Ensuring all lubrication inquiries and protocols are addressed correctly can result in long-term success. From there, you can continuously enhance the process as new opportunities emerge. Great job, HN!</p>
