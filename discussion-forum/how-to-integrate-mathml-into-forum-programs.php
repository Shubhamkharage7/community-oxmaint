            <p>Dear Terry, I kindly request that you do not proceed with this request as it seems that anything involving 'detailed formulas' may be outside the scope of this forum. If needed, you can provide the math equations in a Word attachment for those in this community who wish to access them at their convenience. Introducing formulas into the numerous discussions on this forum may diminish the entertainment factor of posts where authors of 'truly captivating' books engage in lively debates. Apart from that, keep up the great work!</p>

            <p>Vee, where is the insult? Or is this simply another subtle jab at me? As mentioned earlier, it seems like every time I engage in a discussion, you seem to go out of your way to disagree with me. I addressed your queries in the previous thread, but you didn't reciprocate. Is this considered courteous behavior? It's unbelievable how a simple request for additional features on the website escalated into this situation. I didn't anticipate this level of conflict when I initially posted about it.</p>

            <p>Daryl, I'm sorry to see that you have not addressed the questions I previously posed to you. It seems you have misunderstood my points regarding time-based maintenance for random failure patterns. Random failure patterns refer to various distributions, not just patterns D, E, and F as mentioned in N&H. Time-based strategies are suitable for cases where the time to failure can be clearly determined, particularly when the failure probability density function shape factor is significantly greater than one.

Regarding your assertion that human error is not considered in RCM, I must clarify that I never said human error is not a factor, but rather that it is a cause, not a failure mode. I have asked for examples from your RCM studies to support human error as a failure mode, but you have avoided providing a direct response and instead chosen to misinterpret my statements to suit your argument.

Furthermore, our disagreement on the matter of criticality in modern asset management pertains specifically to the failure mode level. I respect your perspective, but I urge you not to impose it on others.

In conclusion, I choose not to engage further with your posts due to a lack of mutual respect in discussions, as demonstrated in interactions with other members. Your approach to communication has been noted by others and does not align with the desired tone for a public forum. As Svenels metaphorically expressed, while some may enjoy swimming in the swamp with alligators, most prefer to drain the swamp instead. Your tendency to respond at length to every comment leaves me with no choice but to disengage. This will be my final message on the matter, as past interactions lead me to expect a response that lacks courtesy and rationality. Thank you for your understanding. V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>If many forum participants advocate for the integration of MathML in the platform, it should be seriously considered. Otherwise, why make the effort? Terry, who typically has a lot of free time on his hands, may not object to dedicating time to this task. Good job, Buzz, for sparking discussion. Your humorous mention of handbags is reminiscent of the popular show Laugh-In.</p>

            <p>Implementing a simple mechanism for formula creation can be extremely beneficial. Being able to incorporate superscripts and subscripts, such as [sup] superscripts [/sup], could greatly enhance the user experience. For instance, instead of using a generic conversion factor like "1.459", having a formula like I y = 1/16 * md[sup]2[/sup] mentioned in a post about a problem at 120 rad/s could spark a more engaging discussion. When dealing with more complex symbols, utilizing the equation editor available in MS Word may be a better option. Your contribution has already generated interest in this topic.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the recent lack of updates as I was busy attending the International Maintenance Conference. I appreciate everyone who participated or showed their support. 
I'd like to remind everyone about the importance of community standards and respect in our discussions. The goal is to emulate the same manners you would use when speaking to your neighbors face-to-face. While debate and differing opinions are encouraged, please remember to maintain respect for each other. We want to create a welcoming environment that encourages knowledge sharing, rather than turning people away.
We value all contributions to this board, not just from our current active members. Regarding MathML, we will explore its implementation and seek input from other members. This request aligns well with our plans for changes in 2006, so please continue sharing your ideas with us. Thank you, Terry O.</p>
