            <p>Welcome to the Forums! When purchasing an HMI from Schneider South Africa, such as the HMISTU655, it may be challenging to upload a program from another HMISTU655 and download it onto the new HMI. I recommend following a detailed procedure for uploading and downloading to ensure success. 

To upload a program, you can use Vijeo Designer and select the "Upload Editor Project..." option. However, please note that you cannot upload the runtime project directly from the HMI to your PC. It is essential to include the Editor Project when creating a project in Vijeo Designer to create a backup file (*.vdz) for downloading to the HMI. This backup file can be uploaded back to the HMI using Vijeo Designer.

Additionally, you can utilize the Data Manager to upload backup files from a USB drive or CF Card on compatible models. It is recommended to use a USB drive to store and run projects on HMISTU655/855 and create backup files easily.

If you have a copy of the original project file or a backup *.bkm file, you can download the project to the new HMI using Ethernet or a USB cable. Alternatively, you can use the Backup Manager in Vijeo Designer to create a backup file of your project to your PC or a USB drive.

Ensure to follow these steps to successfully upload and download programs between HMIs. Good luck!</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Forums! Unfortunately, it is not possible to directly upload the runtime project from the HMI to your PC unless specific steps were taken during the HMI setup. Trying to use the "Upload Editor Project..." feature in Vijeo Designer will not retrieve the project from the HMI Main Drive.

When creating a project in Vijeo Designer, you can enable the "Include Editor Project" option under Target Properties > Download property. This will create a backup file (*.vdz) and save it to a USB drive connected to the HMI USB port. To upload this backup file, use the "Upload Editor Project" function in Vijeo Designer.

Another option is to use the "Data Manager" to upload backup files from a USB drive or CF Card on compatible models. USB drives can be used to store and run projects, as well as store backup files for larger projects.

If the original developer did not choose the "Include Editor Project" option, you may not have a backup of the project. In this case, you can use the "Backup Manager" in Vijeo Designer to create a backup file (*.bkm) to your PC or a USB drive. Alternatively, you can download the project to a new HMI by having a copy of the original project file or a backup *.bkm file and using Ethernet or a USB cable (XBTZG935).

Is there a possibility to obtain a backup if the project does not have the "Include Editor Project" enabled? The original developer did not choose this option, and now there is no backup available for the project.</p>
