                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Congratulations on successfully implementing CMMS & RE! I have some clarifications regarding how you utilized CMMS for safety purposes. In the sentence, "Additionally, the CMMS could be queried to look at cost, safety, work order backlog or just about any metric you could imagine," how specifically did you ensure safety measures were in place? 

Also, I am curious to know where you sourced the tasks for your master plans. Were they based on generic strategies, OEM recommendations, or derived from RCM principles?

Furthermore, I noticed that there were some delinquent work orders with missing information such as actual manhours. To prevent this issue, it is recommended to specify minimum mandatory fields for planned and actual values in work orders.

Lastly, could you provide examples of how you applied the lesson learned "Don't be afraid to alter course"? I found it interesting to see the work order trending in Fig 4 as per the article on reliability engineering and CMMS at http://www.reliabilityweb.com/art07/reliability_engineering_cmms.htm.</p>

            <p>1. Our work order entry system includes a safety-related code that allows us to easily track the volume of safety work orders. 2. The content for our master plan was gathered from various sources, including old MP-2 files, handwritten procedures, and the expertise of our team. Our MPs were designed to be applicable to a wide range of equipment across the plant, with some machine-specific MPs as well. 3. Delinquent work orders often occur when planned maintenance is cancelled due to machine unavailability or insufficient resources. 4. Our focus has shifted over time, from plantwide RCFAs and FMEAs to targeting specific departments with the most pressing issues.</p>

            <p>1. What is the safety protocol in the workplace? Is it classified under work types or a distinct category? 2. It seems like you aren't receiving maintenance procedures from Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM)? Yes, we need to begin somewhere. 3. It seems that your overdue work orders are those that were legitimately postponed. In contrast, mine was related to incomplete work orders with insufficient information entered. 4. The situation is now more understandable.</p>
