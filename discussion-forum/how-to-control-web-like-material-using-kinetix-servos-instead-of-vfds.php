                    <p>One individual claimed vehemently that a pair of VFDs operating on a production line were actually servos, and I took his word for it. How can I utilize Kinetix servos to control a web-like material as if they were VFDs? It's too late to switch gears at this point. 

In more detail, I am controlling the production of asphalt roofing material. This material consists of a backing made of fiberglass or polymer weave that is saturated and coated with asphalt, polymers, films, sand, and rocks. The production process resembles that of a large, odorous, black printing press. This process occurs towards the end of the line, leading into a winder. Initially, there were two VFD/motors responsible for dropping a large loop into a pit for the subsequent section to pull. The motors would deactivate when a lower photoreceptor is obstructed, and resume operation when an upper photosensor is cleared. These have now been replaced with servos.</p>

            <p>Are you worried about a slack loop downstream of the servo motors? And if there is, is the winder situated after the slack loop? Generally, it is beneficial to have servo motors with extra duty cycle and precision capabilities even if they are not always needed, as long as they are appropriately sized for the application.</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, RetiQlum2 claimed that VFDs on a production line were servos, which I initially believed. Now, I am trying to figure out how to utilize Kinetix servos to drive a web-type product like VFDs. The process involves handling asphalt roofing material consisting of fiberglass or polymer weave coated with asphalt, polymers, films, sand, and rock. It resembles a large printing press, leading to a winder where two VFD/motors used to control the material loop. I have now replaced them with servos, bringing about the need for adjustments in operation.

The transition to servos on the winder pit requires careful monitoring and setup to mimic the functionality of VFDs accurately. By enabling the axis and using MAJ and MAS commands on Kinetix, the servos can replicate the start/stop mechanism of VFDs. Although there may be additional maintenance tasks such as axis monitoring and fault resets, once properly configured, the system is expected to operate seamlessly.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>OkiePC asked if there is still a slack loop located downstream of the servo motors that you should be worried about. If there is, is the winder positioned downstream of the slack loop? Generally, having servos with extra duty cycle and precision capabilities, even if not always necessary, is better than the opposite. The winder would indeed be downstream of the pit. In the setup, there is a Finished Product Looper (FPL), which functions as a large chain accumulator operating at line speed with material accumulated in it. A pull roll follows, feeding into the pit, and then to the winder. Some systems use pits, while others may use shock rolls or free loops with the winder suspended in the air, but the concept remains the same.</p>

            <p>For a more advanced setup, consider implementing two bonding mills with flatteners before belt sanders, like we did at my previous workplace. The flatteners were VFD driven, with speed controlled by a tach generator on the main mill motor. A potentiometer adjusted speed based on a dancer arm's angle at the strip exit. Once calibrated, the VFD maintained constant speed for a consistent loop height. If interested, you could try a similar setup or explore MAJ/MAS instructions like @robertmee. While a across-the-line starter may work for stable line speeds, it puts more strain on the motor. Make sure to account for motor service factor and consider using an externally powered cooling fan. Given the availability of VFD/servo drives, it's wise to utilize them for optimal performance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I partially agree with the recommendation to utilize "MAJ/MAS instructions" for controlling the run/stop functions. Another crucial element to consider is the MCD (Motion Change Dynamics). The MAJ instruction directs the servo to operate at a specific velocity and acceleration, serving as a one-time directive that sets the speed and acceleration parameters when triggered. The servo will continue to run at these set values until a new command is issued. On the other hand, the MCD command is used to adjust the velocity or acceleration of the servo. If there are changes in motor speed due to variations in line speed or feedback from load cells or dancers, continuous MCD commands will be necessary. 
When operating VFDs in torque control mode, utilizing servos can present added complexity. While it is achievable, servos are typically more focused on velocity and position control. Therefore, adjustments must be made to efficiently run a servo in torque mode without encountering errors related to position or velocity.</p>

            <p>In many applications, VFDs are frequently replacing servos due to their superior performance and cost-effectiveness. By upgrading to Flux Vector VFDs, you can expect the same or even better results at a more affordable price, ultimately putting an end to any existing issues.</p>

            <p>GaryS mentioned that VFDs are often replacing servos due to their provenance and better pricing. He recommended replacing servos with Flux Vector VFDs to solve any potential problems. Meanwhile, joseph_e2 shared a story about using VFD-driven flatteners in a previous workplace, controlled by a tach generator for speed reference. He suggested implementing a similar system or considering MAJ/MAS instructions for better control. Exploring different options, such as using an "across-the-line starter," may also be viable but could be tougher on the motor. Ultimately, utilizing VFDs or servo drives seems to be the most logical choice for enhanced performance.</p>

            <p>A user on RetiQlum2 forum inquired about the term "across-the-line starter" they had never heard before. This type of starter offers no speed control or ramping capabilities, as it directly supplies the motor with full line voltage and frequency. "Across-the-line" refers to the method of applying power to the motor without any adjustments or control, also known as FVNR.</p>
