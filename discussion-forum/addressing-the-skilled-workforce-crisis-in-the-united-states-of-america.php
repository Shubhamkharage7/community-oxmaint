                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>This issue has been a point of discussion within this community. After a brainstorming session at IMC-2005, I conducted research and compiled the following Essay. I am initiating a general discussion on how to address the current and upcoming changes in our skilled workforce concerning R&M and CBM. One possible solution could be implementing 'Scientific Management' principles in test equipment manufacturing by incorporating go/no go systems and expert systems. Additionally, we may need to develop new software tools and procedures to compensate for the lack of experienced professionals. Collaborating as a group often leads to innovative ideas. The article titled "Workforce Crisis in the United States of America" focuses on the situation in the USA, as it was the primary source of information and statistics for this study. This enlightening seven-page article aims to shed light on the workforce challenges in America. Sincerely, Howard.

            <p>Howard, I must commend you on your exceptional article; thank you for sharing it with us. It appears that there is a concerning decline in the number of school leavers pursuing Science and Maths subjects, not only in the UK but possibly across the EU. The disappearance of Apprenticeship and Journeyman schemes in the UK exacerbates the issue, as there is a shortage of training opportunities for 18-year-olds. This, coupled with the Social Economic model, which leads some students to not engage in economic activities, may result in increased petty crime rates. Additionally, the workforce in the EU has been supplemented by workers from Eastern Europe, impacting their home countries as well. Despite these challenges, it seems that politicians and the public have yet to address these issues. - V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>Howard, I found your paper on the future of maintenance organizations in North America to be insightful. The upcoming years will bring about significant changes in structure, organization, and talent due to several key issues. These issues that will have a major impact on maintenance organizations include: 1. Aging Workforce: The shortage of qualified technical labor in North American manufacturing is a critical concern. 2. Evolving Workforce: A shift from hands-on work to digital simulations, favoring thinkers over tinkerers. 3. Advancing Technology: Increasing use of sensors, data, software, and devices, catering to the needs of a more tech-savvy workforce. 4. Emphasis on Safety: Stricter safety regulations leading to a preference for office-based work environments. 5. Environmental Regulations: More stringent requirements for documentation, necessitating online monitoring and automated report generation. These imminent changes will pose challenges for maintenance organizations in improving asset reliability with a reduced workforce. Implementing intelligent asset management systems appears to be the most effective solution for addressing these challenges.</p>

            <p>Steve presents an intriguing concept rooted in 'Taylorism,' or Scientific Management. This 1911 ideology, which influenced Ford's mass production line, aimed to streamline processes by minimizing skilled labor and human variability. Historically, this approach was limited to manufacturing but advances in technology have expanded its application to various sectors like customer service and maintenance. Terms like 'lean,' reengineering, and Kaizen have emerged as modern adaptations of Scientific Management, impacting tasks like PM timing. However, challenges persist, as seen in the Western Electric Studies (1923-1933), including the erosion of technical expertise, dehumanization of workers, increased stress, and a shift towards managerial duties. As we address current crises, it's crucial to recognize that past solutions may have inadvertently contributed to present issues. For instance, why did organizations like the US DoD overlook the decline in skilled workforce experience as a crisis? While detailed procedures and software aid in task completion, they may not replace the value of hands-on expertise in the long term. The debate continues on whether software dependency is a viable substitute for industry experience. Howard raises thought-provoking questions that challenge conventional wisdom and prompt reflection on the evolution of workforce management strategies.</p>

            <p>The move towards computerized solutions in monitoring shipboard assets is evident in leading indicators such as a presentation by Dr. Jens Pohl at the Office of Naval Research Workshop in 2001. Dr. Pohl highlighted the potential for advancements in computer-based agent systems, leading to a paradigm shift in the integration of human, computer, data, and context domains. This shift is depicted in his diagram, indicating a progression towards increased sharing of "relevant immediate knowledge" within the computer domain.

The US Navy and NASA are already implementing advanced diagnostics and prognostics through computer systems to monitor equipment health and facilitate efficient repairs. This trend towards automation and predictive maintenance is reflected in government spending, indicating the direction of industry products.

For instance, the installation of sensors on overhead cranes can eliminate the need for manual inspections by sending real-time data to a ground-based computer system. By setting up automated alerts for maintenance based on sensor data analysis, downtime can be minimized and potential issues can be addressed proactively.

This proactive approach can be applied to various equipment types, including overhead cranes, to identify and address dominant failure modes efficiently. By leveraging technology for predictive maintenance, organizations can optimize asset performance and reduce operational costs.</p>

            <p>Hello Steve, 
I was discussing the issue of skilled labor availability in relation to stable or declining wages. While there are various factors at play such as outsourcing and automation, typically a tight labor market leads to higher wages as businesses compete for skilled workers. I believe that remote monitoring and rule-based diagnostics are quickly becoming essential components of an effective CBM (Condition-Based Maintenance) program. End users would greatly benefit from having access to standardized guidelines and vendors offering affordable remote monitoring solutions.</p>

            <p>As someone who has experience in academia and research, I approach technological advancements with caution, especially when it comes to their practical applications. I recently attended a presentation at a military logistics meeting that had a simple solution to a complex problem. This solution aims to address the lost experience within the military and the disinterest among younger generations in certain tasks. The concept involves vessels detecting potential issues, rerouting as needed, and ordering parts independently.

However, a key concern raised is who will ensure the accuracy of the information provided by software programs, especially with the continuous development of new systems. Will the reliance on technology diminish the individual thinking capability that has historically given the US military an edge over others? This brings to mind the importance of not losing sight of fundamental knowledge and principles, even when utilizing advanced systems.

Reflecting on a past incident involving a nuclear generator shutdown due to a minor oversight in a motor design, it raises the question of whether software solutions truly solve problems or just add to them. It prompts us to consider if advancements in technology are a temporary fix or a long-term solution. This topic is thoughtfully explored in Ayn Rand's 'Atlas Shrugged,' offering a cautionary tale that remains relevant today.</p>

            <p>Jamie, I now have a better understanding of your point. Having well-defined standards and access to vendors offering cost-effective remote monitoring capabilities would streamline the process significantly. This is exactly my area of expertise - connecting Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) solutions to asset management challenges. Currently, I am assisting a steel mill in setting up a remote monitoring system for a crucial overhead crane. While we are not CBM vendors ourselves, we specialize in implementing solutions from other providers. The costs of these devices have seen a considerable decrease in the past year.</p>

I believe that the shortage of skilled workers is a distinct issue from the development of expert systems and neural networks. I think the emergence of expert systems is driven by the need to ensure reliability and uninterrupted operations, rather than to replace the aging or insufficient skilled workforce as the main goal. Wishing you all Happy Holidays!</p>

            <p>Josh mentioned that including engineering in discussions is crucial. However, there is a decline in the number of direct engineering practitioners who are hands-on in manufacturing compared to those in computer science, posing a challenge to professional societies like IEEE. This issue has been a topic of concern for some time. Josh plans to address this in his upcoming essay series, with the previous one focusing on the census. He also raises the question of whether EAM/CMMS systems offer a solution to this problem. Feedback from users of EAM/CMMS software solutions would be appreciated. Howard.</p>

            <p>Hello Howard, Steve, and others, I have a fresh perspective on how technology is applied. It's important to consider that every solution can potentially lead to a new problem. The key is ensuring that the new problem is smaller in scale than the original one. When we consider implementing sensors or remote monitoring, we must acknowledge that sensors require calibration and may drift over time. They can also fail due to dust, moisture, or other factors. Placing sensors in hard-to-reach areas may result in inadequate maintenance, both in terms of timeliness and quality. Relying heavily on these sensors can lead to significant issues if they malfunction. Additionally, the maintenance skill levels needed for more advanced technology are higher than for traditional methods. If we are facing a shortage of skilled workers, as mentioned previously, where will we find these highly skilled individuals? In closing, I would like to wish you all Season's Greetings and Best Wishes for the upcoming year. V.Narayan.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The core issue lies in the limitations of remote monitoring systems and computers in replicating human senses and intuition. The decline of skilled workers who can instinctively detect issues with machinery is evident, with a shift in attitude towards reliability and maintenance, as seen in Star Trek. While in the original series Scotty took pride in maintaining the ship, in The Next Generation, characters like Giordy relied more on technology. This shift in attitude is reflected in the declining interest in skilled trades as a career choice, influenced by negative perceptions perpetuated by teachers and parents.

A Canadian study highlighted the decreasing value placed on skilled trades since the early 1900s, attributing it to changes in management practices under Taylor's Scientific Management. Older skilled workers often have hands-on hobbies like home improvement, while the newer generation lacks similar skills and interests. This trend is also observed in the management side of industries, with fewer managers beginning their careers at the grassroots level.

The perception of skilled trades as menial work has persisted, as exemplified by outdated beliefs that only unintelligent individuals are suited for such tasks. However, the evolving nature of trades work demands greater skill and expertise, necessitating a shift in perception to attract the right talent.</p>

            <p>Greetings to all! While I may not be an educator or engineer, I am a dedicated marketer with a passion for staying up-to-date on the latest technology trends. I have extensive experience in working with various types of IC engines, monitoring lubricants, and implementing extended life lubricants to reduce maintenance costs in fleets. It is surprising to see that the use of Group IV specification lubes has not been widely recognized as a solution to high maintenance costs, which can account for up to 30% of operating budgets in average fleets.

In my efforts to address this issue, I recently spoke with an Instructor at a local Junior College about the lack of training on lubricants funded by manufacturers. It seems that the focus is mainly on mechanical procedures rather than on maximizing the lifespan of equipment through proper lubrication. Despite this, I believe that educators can adapt their curriculum to incorporate the latest technologies, such as synthetic lubricants, to provide a more comprehensive education for mechanics.

In the lubricants industry, it is essential to differentiate between true synthetic lubricants, like Group IV lubes, and blends that may be labeled as synthetic but still contain mineral content. I have a potential solution to improve maintenance practices and reduce costs, but it will require time and effort to implement. If there is interest in exploring this further, I am more than willing to share my insights. Thank you for your attention.</p>

            <p>I rely on information from Lubes and Greases Magazine articles and company training sessions, where we developed the first true Group IV synthetic (Non-Mineral based) lubricant. You can find resources online, but if you're seeking quick explanations on workforce issues mentioned in these comments, I recommend speaking directly to an educator for their training sources. The maintenance community tends to be skeptical of new technologies not outlined in their manuals, and manufacturers often overlook educating users on how lubricants and equipment can prolong lifespan. I am happy to provide assistance in promoting a deeper understanding of how lubricants impact durability and environmental factors, leading to improved workforce efficiency through new and innovative technologies.</p>

            <p>Recent discussions have been circulating in the media regarding universities adapting their course offerings to align with industry demands. There is a noticeable decline in interest towards engineering programs, with many individuals opting for alternative courses that appear to provide more promising opportunities. This has prompted conversations around the need to revamp the field of engineering through innovative approaches, often referred to as re-engineering or reinventing engineering. 

It is commonly believed that engineering graduates from the UK excel in design, while those from the US possess strong business and entrepreneurial skills. Is there truth to these stereotypes, or do graduates possess a combination of both skill sets? 

Some companies are actively incorporating cutting-edge technologies into the skill set of engineers to advance their careers in technical or specialist roles, rather than pursuing management or generalist positions. If you are seeking information on Lub groups I, II, III, IV, or similar topics, what keywords should you search for in order to access comprehensive articles on the subject?

            <p>In the United States, the University system operates as a business, with many institutions responding to student and employer demands by shifting from traditional Electrical Engineering departments to more modern Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) programs. This change is largely driven by the influence of computer-based companies investing in universities to groom future workers. The evolving job market has also played a role in shaping academic offerings, as universities strive to attract students by emphasizing the percentage of graduates hired both before and after graduation. Despite these shifts, societal pressures still push young people away from skilled trade professions. This phenomenon is not exclusive to the US, as similar trends have been observed in studies conducted in Canada and Australia. The struggle to introduce new ideas and products in the market has been witnessed firsthand by individuals like Mr. Filter, who worked at Amoco Labs during the development of the groundbreaking Amoco Ultimate synthetic oil. As discussions on the importance of skilled trades continue, it would be beneficial to explore further insights by sharing relevant links or articles, such as those mentioned in previous discussions.

            <p>Hello Josh! It's great to hear from you, even though I'm not in the field of education or engineering. You can find all the necessary materials and information at the American Petroleum Institute (API) website, www.api.com, and also at the International Lubricants Society of America (ILSAC) website, www.ilsac.com. These organizations establish and enforce many of the specifications and standards in the industry. API uses a starburst symbol to indicate oil specification levels through a letter-coded system, rather than grouping lubes into classes. For example, non-commercial use products may display an SJ/SL symbol on the packaging. To understand this better, it's recommended to check a typical lubricant manufacturer's spec sheet. I suggest visiting www.amsoil.com, navigating to the motor oils section, selecting a product you're familiar with, and exploring the various specifications set by global authorities on lubricants.

It's interesting to note that Dr. Penrose's expertise in education comes into play here, but my knowledge is solely based on field experience and user feedback. I recently spoke to two vehicle mechanics instructors at a junior college about how they obtain course materials, and only then did they mention the difference between mineral and true synthetic oils. The molecular structures of these oils vary significantly, affecting their performance in reducing friction. If you'd like more insights based on my experience, please let me know.

Regarding Dr. Penrose's comment, it's important to consider different approaches and their outcomes when addressing the workforce decline issue. During my visit to major agricultural operations in central California, the maintenance supervisor mentioned that lubricants didn't play a significant role in efforts to reduce fuel consumption. This highlighted the need for further education and training for staff members, not just sales pitches. Enhancing understanding and knowledge within the workforce is crucial for a paradigm shift in the industry.</p>

            <p>I have been following this discussion with great interest. My career began with less glamorous tasks than mechanical work, but I was always grateful to have a job. Today, there is a noticeable shift in the workforce that has never been seen before. Many lower-skilled jobs are being outsourced to immigrant workers, while new engineers are entering the field without practical knowledge, such as wiring a three-phase motor. Skilled tradesmen seem to be in the minority in my area, yet wages have not increased despite supply and demand. Personally, I decided to leave the paper industry due to the concerning direction it seems to be heading in the United States. The next decade or two will certainly be intriguing.</p>

            <p>Discover a captivating sea story based on real experiences in the Navy. This narrative delves into the importance of skilled labor and the impact of its depletion, as explored through a personal journey. Back in high school, I excelled in track sports and socializing with peers. However, it was my involvement in VICA that led me to work as a chemical technician at Amoco Labs and later as a radiator repairman. Despite having opportunities for further education in Chemical Engineering, I chose to enlist in the Navy. Assigned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt, I found myself in charge of motor repair on the aircraft carrier. Amidst challenges and setbacks, I navigated through the complexities of motor rewinding, showcasing determination and expertise. This experience shed light on the criticality of a skilled workforce and the value of practical knowledge passed down through generations. It serves as a driving force for my commitment to education, skill development, and bridging the gap in training new tradesmen. The story underscores the irreplaceable nature of hands-on experience and the repercussions of a diminishing skilled workforce in the maintenance industry.</p>

            <p>Collaboration is key in today's job market, as teamwork has become the norm in completing tasks. The traditional roles of the individual machinist and their apprentice/helper are evolving into a more team-oriented approach. What used to require one skilled person and a helper now involves a team of six individuals. This shift may result in longer completion times due to the coordination needed for smooth workflow. However, the team dynamic offers the benefit of contracting individuals only for the duration of the project, unlike permanently stationed skilled workers.

This approach may initially save costs, but there could be repercussions down the line. Some may question the logic of cutting corners now only to redo work later and bill it to another department. Despite these concerns, work continues to be completed successfully through this evolving philosophy of teamwork.</p>

            <p>Hello Howard, I trust that you had a pleasant festive season, as did all those who contribute to this platform. I fully agree with you on the issue of de-skilling in the Western world. It's important to address this problem, but what actions are being taken to combat it? What are the underlying causes of this shift from technical trades to other sectors in the workforce? The transformation of economies from production-based to service-oriented, technology-driven, and retail-focused is evident in many countries, including Australia where 60% of GDP comes from service businesses. Does this shift justify the transition from traditional skilled labor to a different type of skilled workforce? While I support the idea of re-skilling nations in Western economies, we must also consider the challenges we face in implementing this change.</p>

            <p>Dear Howard,

I appreciate you sharing your story, it was truly inspiring. The argument regarding the shift from service to manufacturing has some flaws. Firstly, there is a lack of focus on developing essential service skills, as apprenticeship and journeyman schemes are not widely implemented. Certain services cannot be outsourced and must be provided locally. Additionally, there is a correlation between manufacturing and service skills, particularly in Engineering activities. For example, skills from Construction Firms can easily transfer to maintenance work. It is crucial for any economy to have a balanced distribution of skills. However, policymakers are emphasizing high-value skills at the expense of a diverse skill set. Not all workers can fit into high-skilled roles, leading to a push for more individuals to attend University in the UK, resulting in a lack of skilled craftspeople. This shortage has led to the importation of workers from other countries, while unemployed local youths face challenges in finding employment, leading to issues in inner cities.

            <p>Vee: Definitely. We are conducting a comprehensive study to address issues that we have personally encountered in the field. While direct observation is valuable, conducting a study allows for a more precise understanding of the situation. Our research includes insights from various sources such as studies from Canada, Australia, US States, Unions, NAM, Europe, and more. Through our study, we have identified two main issues - communication between maintenance and management, which has evolved into a skills problem. Both of these issues have been making recent headlines, notably with the Disney incident highlighted by Terry, and the recent West Virginia mining tragedy. In a recent interview on Good Morning America, there was a noticeable disconnect between workers and management, a common occurrence. This raises questions like: - What is causing this disconnect? - How can we address it? - How can we emphasize the importance of skilled workers in the industry? - How can we highlight the importance of expertise in reliability? Do you share these concerns? Howard</p>

            <p>Howard, I'm unsure if you understood my point or if I misinterpreted your response. At a larger scale, there appears to be a diminishing demand for the specific skills we're discussing. I have restated my argument below. The UK's manufacturing and mining sectors suffered substantial setbacks at the end of the previous century, with a drastic decline in coal production and manufacturing not being as robust as it was a decade ago. Despite these challenges, the UK remains the fourth largest economy globally. In the early 1990s, Australia experienced a decline in its manufacturing industry, yet it continues to attract new investments and withstand economic downturns with resilience. Many economies are shifting towards service-oriented, technology-driven, and retail consumer-based models from traditional manufacturing and industrial economies. In Australia, 60% of the GDP comes from service businesses. So, could this justify a transition to a different skilled workforce? It seems necessary to develop new skills and expertise to address the current challenges. While expertise in reliability, maintenance, and asset management is crucial, we must consider how many professionals with these skills will be needed in the future.</p>

            <p>Daryl: I just wanted to bring attention to the project. You're absolutely right. A new type of workforce is emerging based on my research. Despite this, traditional skills in maintenance are still necessary. Here's an interesting thought: How can we sustain a 'service economy' without a foundation in sectors like minerals, forestry, agriculture, or manufacturing? From my experience in business training, it seems that many MBA's and other executive management professionals believe that wealth is generated on Wall Street. Howard</p>

            <p>Howard, it seems like we are on the same page here. While I may not have all the answers, I do have a few opinions on the question you raised about the "base" of an economy. Companies like Microsoft and Google play a significant role in our economy, but they don't rely on traditional craftsmen like some industries do. The evolving landscape of industries like technology, banking, and communications is shifting towards more specialized skills and industry-specific expertise, leaving some traditional labor-intensive sectors struggling with job losses. It's clear that someone needs to take action to drive the economy forward. While Wall Street may have their own perspective, it ultimately comes down to the individuals who are actively making things happen. I personally have seen the positive impact of creating opportunities, such as three new apprenticeships for young people, which may seem small but are significant for those individuals. However, as we continue these discussions, I am eager to hear different viewpoints on this complex issue.</p>

            <p>Howard, I have no definite answer, but I don't disagree with you. The economy is increasingly driven by services and technology, with financial, information, and consulting services playing a significant role in the economies of the US, UK, and various European countries. Despite economic fluctuations, these sectors continue to thrive. The UK, for example, is the fourth largest economy globally, showcasing the strength of its service-based economy. While traditional industries may shift to low-wage economies in the future, certain sectors like defense, utilities, and essential industries will remain steadfast. Skilled workers may find more opportunities in heavy industrial sectors, such as oil and gas, mining, and facilities management, leading to a more specialized workforce. This could potentially result in higher earnings for experienced individuals in these industries. Overall, the demand for skilled workers appears to be evolving, presenting uncertainties for the future workforce.</p>

            <p>Dear Sirs,

Having recently reviewed your arguments, it is clear that Western economies are indeed shifting towards a more service-oriented approach. This transition is driven by several factors, including lower costs and higher revenue potential. In addition, the tightening regulations and higher living standards in advanced societies have led manufacturers to relocate their operations to cheaper and less regulated regions. As a result, workers in these areas are gaining more skills and becoming better equipped to perform tasks at a lower cost.

This trend has created a challenging cycle where decision-makers are faced with tough choices that may involve sacrificing some benefits or incurring higher costs. This discomfort may even make competition unfeasible for some. Ultimately, finding solutions to these issues will be crucial for the continued success of Western economies.

Thank you for your attention to these important matters.

Best regards,

            <p>Ahmed: Absolutely, you are correct. In these countries, there is a growing realization that as workers gain more skills, they deserve higher wages and a say in the speed of their production lines. It's a challenging cycle to break. During my recent drive from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Humbolt, Iowa, I had an interesting experience. I overheard a community college discussing an upcoming meeting for students interested in careers as machinists, industrial electricians, and other skilled trades. Representatives from John Deere will be present, offering to fund a two-year program for students and forgive the financing if they are hired for at least six months post-graduation. This proactive approach by a company is refreshing, as it shifts the responsibility from schools and the government to provide workers-ready-to-work. Well done, John Deere! Howard</p>
