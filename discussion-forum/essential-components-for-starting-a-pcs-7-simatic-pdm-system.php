                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>A customer has expressed interest in developing a PROFINET IO device over APL and requires guidance starting from scratch. As part of my consulting services, I am assisting this customer with determining the necessary investment for the PLC IO system. While I am well-versed in factory automation, my knowledge in process automation is more limited, so I would appreciate any advice.

I understand that developing a PA Profile compliant device will require the proper testing tools. Simply using a PLC may necessitate developing a PLC program implementing the FB in ladder logic. While this is theoretically possible, in practice it may prove challenging, especially for those with limited proficiency in PROFIBUS PA, like my customer and myself. Therefore, I need to provide a Bill of Materials (BOM) outlining the required components.

Is the following list accurate and complete?
1) APL switch
2) License for SIMATIC Process Control System PCS 7 SIMATIC PDM Readme V9.1
3) License for TIA Portal v19
4) An S7-1500 PLC, preferably with a PROFIBUS DP interface for future compatibility. Would you be able to recommend a specific part number?

Thank you for taking the time to review this information.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for helpful information about device certification and PA Profile info, the link below from PI North America's Development website may be useful. It also provides details on reference implementations that you can test with. While Simatic PDM is commonly associated with Simatic Manager/PCS7, its compatibility with Tia Portal is less clear. It's uncertain if 1500/Portal supports APL, as it is a relatively new development. However, there is an indication that APL is supported for PCS7. For additional assistance, you can visit the SIOS support page on Siemens' website.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your interest and support. The TIA Portal V19 now has the capability to support PA profile GSDML files, which includes the advanced physical layer necessary for developing PROFINET IO devices. When it comes to choosing a PLC for your project, whether using standard RJ45 Ethernet or APL, the S7-1500 is likely to be the top choice for many end-users. With the inclusion of the PA Profile functionality, utilizing Simatic Manager/PCS7 as your tool of choice is highly recommended.

While it is theoretically possible to create your own function blocks in TIA Portal, using Simatic Manager/PCS7 provides a convenient off-the-shelf solution. Additionally, having a license for Simatic Manager/PCS7 can be advantageous for after-sales support. If you are experiencing delays in responses from the local Siemens team, it may be helpful to consider these factors when deciding on the best course of action for your project. Thank you for your feedback and support.</p>

            <p>I may not be able to assist directly, but I can share my experience using PDM with PCS7 for configuring and installing Profibus PA devices. Typically, the PDM software is installed on an Engineering Station alongside Simatic Manager. Begin by accessing the hardware view, adding the Profibus card to the rack, and importing device files. After dropping your device onto the network, it should automatically appear as node 126 (note that this may vary for Profinet). You will then assign memory addresses to the device before going online to adjust the node address and restarting the device.

It's worth mentioning that 3rd party devices are available for setting node addresses, but they can be costly and not commonly found in facilities. Once you have the correct node address, you can proceed to configure the device online. With Profibus devices, scaling is handled within the device itself, eliminating the need for traditional channel drivers in the CFC.

Keep in mind that PDM can be sluggish. In PCS7, the next step would involve constructing a CFC and assigning memory addresses, rendering a "custom" FB unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Ken, for the helpful information. PROFINET IO over APL represents the future of intrinsic safety compliant devices, eventually replacing PROFIBUS PA. The concept involves transferring all PROFIBUS PA device functionalities to Ethernet APL in terms of the physical layer, utilizing PROFINET IO for the protocol, and implementing the PA Profile for the application. Therefore, if a customer is looking to create a PA Profile compliant device, this tool is essential for development.</p>
