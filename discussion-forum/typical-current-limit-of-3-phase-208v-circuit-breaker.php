            <p>When dealing with electrical circuits operating at 120 volts, it is important to follow proper guidelines for safety and efficiency. According to the NEC 70 code book, circuits with 15 amps using 14 gauge wire are rated at 12 amps, while circuits with 20 amps using 12 gauge wire are rated at 16 amps. This calculation is based on a standard multiplier of 1.25 (125%).

As for the question regarding 208 volt 3-phase systems, it is important to consider a variety of factors before providing a specific answer. Factors such as the power company's main plant disconnect, feeders, branch circuits, and motors all play a role in determining the appropriate fuses or circuit breakers needed. These components must be carefully selected based on factors like load, duty cycle, heat, and the number of conductors in the conduit.

It is important to remember that each electrical system is unique and must be carefully evaluated to ensure safety and proper functionality. Regards, James.</p>

            <p>When evaluating breaker sizing in a control panel, it's important to understand that it is not a one-size-fits-all situation. The correct breaker size is determined by adherence to electrical codes and regulations. To determine the appropriate breaker size for your control panel, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the electrical codes in place. Our recommendation is to ensure that you are using the correct breaker size for optimal safety and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Is ignorance a sin? Maybe not, but being ignorant and still believing you are qualified to do something can be quite concerning. The concept of a "current limit" can be confusing - a breaker doesn't limit current, it actually stops the flow of current when there is an excess. If you're wondering about the trip point of a 20A circuit breaker, it is generally around 20A, but there are tolerances to consider. The main purpose of a circuit breaker is to protect conductors, and the sizing rules are based on the acceptable tolerances of the breakers. For example, a 20A circuit breaker is typically used to protect 12ga wire, with the load not exceeding 80% of the circuit size, meaning around 16A in reality. A properly applied circuit breaker should not trip unless there is a problem causing the current to exceed design values. Each circuit breaker comes with a "Time Current Curve" (TCC) chart from the manufacturer, which can help predict trip times at different current levels.</p>

            <p>When it comes to electrical systems, it's important to understand the circuit breaker ratings. For example, a typical single-phase 120V power supply usually has a 20A circuit breaker. However, when dealing with a 3-phase 208V system, the circuit breaker current limit should be equivalent to that of a single-phase 120V circuit with the same current rating. Using terms like "typical" may not provide specific enough information in this context.</p>

            <p>Most machines I've worked on have machine feeds that require fuses for safety. It is crucial to not exceed a 15amp fuse on each phase to prevent hazards. For a 3 phase 208v system, use 3 independent Bussman fuses for each leg, or for a single phase 208v system, use 2 independent 15amp Bussman fuses for each leg. Always remember to lock out and tag the throw switch when connecting the machine, and ensure your working environment is secure, even if it's in your garage. Keep a CO2 fire extinguisher nearby and have a fire alarm installed within reach. Additionally, use an isolation transformer to minimize the risk of electrocution. Acquire a yellow plastic fuse puller for safe fuse replacement. Opt for quick blow fuses for Bussman fuses, unless dealing with large equipment such as a turbine blower motor, where slow blow fuses are appropriate. Avoid using makeshift tools like copper pipes for fuse replacement. When in doubt, seek assistance from a licensed electrician or consult your town's electrical inspector for guidance, as it is better to ask for help than to take risks, especially when starting from scratch.</p>

            <p>Avoid using a section of copper pipe to replace a blown fuse in your electrical system, as this can be dangerous. Instead, seek assistance from a licensed electrician or your town's electrical inspector. It's always better to ask for help than to guess and risk making a mistake. In a stamping plant with a welding department, a spot welder was found to be blowing fuses due to a faulty replacement with a copper bar. This led to the implementation of safety measures such as locking cabinets for welder controls. Remember, human error can lead to dangerous situations.</p>

            <p>It is disappointing to see individuals criticizing someone for asking a simple question. We have all encountered those who believe they know everything and refuse to seek advice or admit when they are unsure. These types can be risky to work with. 

In response to the question, the size of a breaker is typically determined based on the current carrying capacity of the circuit wiring (ampacity) to prevent overheating and insulation damage. Factors such as insulation type, ambient temperature, number of wires in the conduit, and equipment current limits are taken into consideration during this calculation. 

For example, if you have 10 gauge wire capable of carrying 30 amps, but it is connected to a receptacle rated for only 15 amps, a 15 amp breaker would be necessary. It can be overwhelming to navigate through all this information, but ultimately, the breaker's purpose is to prevent wiring issues and overheating.</p>

It is important to consider equipment current limits as well, as mismatched components can be dangerous.
