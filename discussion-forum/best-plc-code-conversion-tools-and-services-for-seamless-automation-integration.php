            <p>There are only a few firms specializing in conversions that I am aware of. One such company is Javlyn Automation based in New York, renowned for their expertise in PLC-3 conversions. Control Technology Inc. is another firm specializing in supporting and converting legacy TI 500 series controllers. Typically, you will find integrators or engineering companies within specific industries that offer and support modern platforms while also having proficiency in transitioning from older systems. The availability of such services may vary depending on your location; for instance, Javlyn may not operate in India. To receive more tailored advice, it would be beneficial to specify the controller brands and technologies you are interested in.</p>

            <p>Hello Ken, 

Currently, I am engaged in a project involving the conversion of Rockwell PLC code to GE PLC code. I understand that this is a challenging task, so I am seeking information on available tools for PLC code conversion to explore more efficient alternatives. Can you assist me in finding the best solution for this conversion process? Thank you.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Looking for a tool to convert an RSLogix500 or RSLogix5000 file to a GE Proficy Machine Edition file? Consider the time and resources needed to create and maintain such an app. The challenge lies in staying up-to-date with multiple software versions from both Rockwell and GE. Additionally, the market demand for such a specific tool may be limited.

Furthermore, any conversion process is akin to translating a novel word by word in a dictionary. How can logic written for Rockwell instructions be accurately translated to GE functions? It's essential to consider the efficiency of rewriting code to accommodate different software platforms.

Ultimately, developing a conversion app for specific brands involves significant challenges and may not yield sufficient demand to justify the effort.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am undertaking a project to transition a program originally designed for a GE 90-70 system to a ControlLogix platform. The I/O addressing and data syntax have proven to be different, presenting a challenge given my limited experience with GE systems. To navigate this, I am leveraging the existing GE program to outline the control functionality and translating it into pseudocode in English. This serves as a roadmap for developing the ControlLogix code for seamless integration.</p>

            <p>Whenever I have needed to upgrade a PLC to a new model, I have consistently followed the advice provided by Ken in the above comments. Whether transitioning from an SLC to a ControlLogix, both from the same manufacturer but on different platforms, I have found it more efficient to comprehend the existing code and rewrite it from the start rather than using a conversion tool. This approach leads to a cleaner outcome and significantly reduces the headaches involved in troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>Based on my experience, no software utility can guarantee 100% accuracy. You will likely need to manually check and address any errors that may arise, even when using software designed for Rockwell devices. This remains true even for smaller upgrades.</p>

            <p>kdburns03 mentioned that while a systems integrator may choose to use a software utility, Curelom Engineering prefers manual migration. This is because software conversion utilities are known to introduce errors or overlook certain functions during the process. It's frustrating when using a utility like SLC500 to CLX results in incorrectly formatted B3 and T4 arrays in CLX. It's generally more beneficial to rewrite the code in a contextual manner rather than line by line, allowing for the full utilization of the capabilities of the target processor.</p>

In the United States, Siemens provides a complimentary program conversion service, although they require you to engage an integrator from their partner program for further assistance. It's important to note that utilizing a conversion tool may result in programming the new PLC in the style of the old one, disregarding best practices. Ultimately, a code conversion tool may not save you money in the long run or prevent the need for retraining your team. While it may save time initially, it could potentially lead to longer troubleshooting, fixing, or making changes in the future.</p>
