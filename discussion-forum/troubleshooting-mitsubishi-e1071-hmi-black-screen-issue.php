                    <p>Hello experts! I am currently facing an issue with my Mitsubishi E1071 HMI. When I power on the unit, it goes through the booting process and then displays a black screen after loading the application. I have also tried different settings using the dip switches, but the result remains the same. I have attempted to reset the settings, and although it was successful, the issue persists. I have also conducted a self-test, which showed everything passing except for the battery at first; however, I have since replaced it. Can anyone provide assistance with this issue, or is my HMI beyond repair?</p>

            <p>If you have E-Designer, make sure to check if anything appears on the screen when you boot up. If the screen is at normal brightness, it may indicate a faulty unit. However, if it appears dull, it could be a backlight issue. Keep in mind that the E series has been succeeded by the newer IX series. If your unit is not working and you are unable to upload the application to E-designer or do not have the original file, your options are limited. Consider getting a replacement unit, either second-hand, repairing it, or upgrading to the current IX model. Without the project file, upgrading may not be possible.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If a device passes all tests successfully, it indicates that it is not completely faulty. In order to conduct these tests, both the screen and backlight must be fully operational. One potential solution to address any issues could involve a firmware upgrade. The firmware file can be obtained from Beijer Electronics website. However, setting up the firmware may require some effort.

For detailed instructions on performing a firmware upgrade, refer to the Service and Maintenance manual available on the Beijer Electronics website. To optimize the backlight settings, load a project with the backlight turned on and set to a moderate level. These adjustments can be made in the 'Setup/System Signals' section of E-Designer. By setting the switches to 1000, access the User Menu and upload a new project to the HMI.

Alternatively, connect to the device using a web browser. You will need to know the HMI's IP address, which can be configured in the User Menu. Through the web browser, you can adjust the backlight settings without encountering any issues related to the backlight level.

If the issues persist, consider seeking professional assistance. It may be necessary to replace the HMI unit, so explore all available options in the market before making a final decision. Beijer Electronics may not offer all the necessary components or a suitable price point.</p>

            <p>When booting up, ensure you have E-Designer connected to see if the screen displays normally. If the screen is bright, the unit may be faulty; if it is dim, the backlight could be the issue. The E series has been replaced by the newer IX series. If the unit is unresponsive and you cannot upload the application or do not have the original file, your options are limited. Consider getting a second-hand replacement unit, repairing it, or upgrading to the current IX model. Without the project file, upgrading may not be possible. Keep in mind that sometimes the application is accessible but the screen turns black after a few minutes. Connect to E-Designer for troubleshooting.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>BryanG noted that if a device passes all tests, it cannot be entirely defective. In order to perform tests, the screen and backlight must be operational. To troubleshoot, consider a firmware upgrade by downloading the required file from Beijer Electronics' website. Although the installation process may be challenging, refer to the Service and Maintenance manual for instructions on how to upgrade the firmware.

One potential solution is to load a project with the backlight set to a mid-level in the 'Setup/System Signals' section of E-Designer. Access the User Menu by setting the switches to 1000, which should allow you to upload a new project to the HMI. Alternatively, connect to the device using a web browser after configuring the IP address in the User Menu. This method bypasses any backlight intensity issues.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, there may be underlying problems. Consider exploring the full range of options in the HMI market before considering a replacement. It is possible that Beijer Electronics may not offer all the necessary solutions at an affordable price. Finally, if all tests have passed, pay attention to the display colors during the self-test process for further insights into the issue.</p>

            <p>As per Brian's suggestion, it is important to investigate the power supply as well. I recall a situation where the 24v supply was actually only 20v due to deteriorated smoothing capacitors, resulting in a significant ripple effect that caused the screen to blackout. It is also possible that failing components, such as electrolytic capacitors in the HMI, may be contributing to the issue. Don't forget to thoroughly check these components to ensure smooth operation and prevent any screen issues.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the mistake, the E1000 series is accessed using a VNC viewer, not a web browser. For secure remote connection, I recommend downloading the VNC Viewer by RealVNC®. This original VNC Viewer is highly secure and reliable. To set it up, go to Setup / Network Services and enable Remote Access, then add passwords as needed.

During testing, ensure that both the HMI screen and VNC view display consistent colors. If you encounter issues with the HMI screen going black, consider replacing it with a Beijer T70, which is equivalent to the E1071 but usually available at a lower price on platforms like eBay. Though programming may differ slightly, transferring files via a USB stick is a viable alternative.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In a recent conversation, BryanG acknowledged making an error by suggesting the use of a web browser for remote viewing the E1000 series. Instead, the appropriate tool is a VNC viewer, such as the one offered by RealVNC®. RealVNC® Viewer is known for its security features and reliability when connecting to devices remotely. To access the VNC Viewer, visit www.realvnc.com to download the software.

When using the VNC Viewer, navigate to Setup / Network Services and enable Remote Access while setting up passwords for added security. It is important to note that the HMI screen and VNC view should display the same content.

If experiencing issues with the HMI screen, particularly if it turns black after powering up, consider replacing it with a Beijer T70 rather than a Mitsubishi E1071. Although both devices are essentially the same, the Beijer version is often available at a lower price on platforms like ebay. Keep in mind that while E-Designer may not directly program the Beijer T70, you can still transfer files using a USB stick as a workaround.

Additionally, please be aware that using a VNC viewer may result in a black screen if the dip switch 1000 settings are incorrect. Make sure to double-check the settings to avoid this issue.</p>

            <p>During the booting process, everything appears clear, and updates are also successful. However, there seems to be an issue where the application intermittently turns black after a few minutes of use. This could potentially be related to a fault with the backlight. While I may not have the expertise to provide further assistance, it is worth considering checking the cables connected to the screen after safely powering off and opening up the HMI device. Older models may use inverters for backlighting, whereas newer ones utilize LED technology. Spare backlights are available, although they may not be easily found on platforms like eBay. Consider reaching out to a local HMI or laptop repair shop for further assistance on resolving this issue. Beijer/Mitsubishi tech support may also be able to offer insights, despite the age of the HMI in question.</p>
