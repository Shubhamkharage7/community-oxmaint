                    <p>Hello everyone, we recently acquired a new Nordson hot glue system with 6 hoses and guns. However, we are encountering an issue where it skips over 4 of them during the cycling process.

            <p>For a more comprehensive understanding, additional information is required. The Nordson system we utilized featured its own unique operating system. In response to your query, the system settings may have contained the necessary details, although they were somewhat unreliable. If there is a malfunction, the system may not heat up correctly. You should investigate whether someone has disabled gun #4. Our system also included color indicators on the screen to easily determine the status of each gun.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you have a new equipment and are experiencing issues with sensors detecting parts or potential blockages, it is recommended to reach out to Nordson for assistance. Proper alignment of sensors is crucial for ensuring accurate detection. If there is a problem with a solenoid or blockage, an error message should be generated. It is also important to check if the nozzle is properly enabled as suggested by the manufacturer.</p>
