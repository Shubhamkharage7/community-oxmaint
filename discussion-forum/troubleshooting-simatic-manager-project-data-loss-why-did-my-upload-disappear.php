                    <p>Hello everyone. I recently visited a client's site, where I uploaded data from the S7-300 (CPU312), made some modifications, and saved the changes. However, when I returned to the office, my program was empty. It was previously populated with Fb's, Ob's, and other objects while online. Now, when I open it, there is nothing there. I thought I had saved the project, but it seems like it didn't actually save. I am still learning Siemens technology and may have made a mistake. I followed instructions from YouTube University, but it didn't work as expected. Thank you for your help.</p>
