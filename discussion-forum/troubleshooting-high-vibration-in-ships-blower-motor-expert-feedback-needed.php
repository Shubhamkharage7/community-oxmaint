            <p>Hello Kishore, I agree with the previous comments that it is not clear what you are asking. As you mentioned, there might be an imbalance in the impeller at 1xRPM. Possible sources of fouling could include general cleanliness/build-up or carbon build-up. It is important to consider if the blower has ever been cleaned or replaced, as this could have occurred during dry-dock. Additionally, issues with engine room ventilation/pressure should be investigated. It is also worth checking the results of the last scavenge space/under piston inspections to assess the condition of the liner/piston rings and cylinder lubrication. Looking for indications of combustion gas blow-by is crucial. Any additional information or a clearer question would be beneficial. Gareth Ward, a Chartered Engineer passionate about Asset Management, would be happy to provide further assistance. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your message. When dealing with a simple machine like this, there are a few common issues to watch out for: 1. Problems with bearings such as faults, failures, or looseness 2. Looseness of the impeller or motor cooling fan on the shaft 3. Imbalance of the rotor or motor cooling fan 4. Cracks in the impeller 5. Mounting faults 6. Runout of the impeller. To achieve optimal performance without any harmonics or sidebands, focus on issues 3 and 6. It would be beneficial to analyze the trend data for the equipment and see if there was a sudden increase or a gradual trend up. This information can help determine if there was any damage, incidents, fouling, or blockages affecting the performance of the blower. By monitoring the vibration data from the online wireless sensor, we can address any potential issues and ensure the blower is functioning efficiently. Thank you for sharing the images for reference.

            <p>Greetings! The inspection of the blower impeller revealed its overall condition, as depicted in the attached photographs. No cracks, looseness, or abnormalities were found, except for carbon deposition.

When analyzing the vibration of the main engine auxiliary blower, it is crucial to consider potential issues such as bearing faults, impeller or motor cooling fan looseness, rotor imbalance, cracks in the impeller, mounting faults, and impeller runout. To generate 1x without any harmonics or sidebands, issues related to impeller runout or mounting faults are the most probable.

It is worth noting that the equipment trend has been on alert for a month, prompting continuous alert reports for inspection. While the vibration data post-assembly is pending, monitoring and addressing any potential issues promptly is essential.

Your expert opinion on ship main engine auxiliary blower vibration analysis is greatly appreciated. Utilizing online wireless tri-axial vibration sensors, we have identified a high vibration trend and a dominant 1XR.P.M peak. Our recommendation to inspect for unbalance or impeller fouling was acted upon, leading to the recent inspection and the images provided for reference. Thank you for your insights and feedback.</p>

            <p>Have you performed a resonance bump test to identify any resonance or its multiples near the fan's operating speed? Balancing may decrease the 1X levels, but even a slight adjustment can cause the resonance to amplify the vibration levels. Jim Cerda from JJC Consulting has shared this valuable insight.

            <p>Considering the feedback from other contributors, additional information is necessary, including the absolute vibration trend, to conduct a more thorough analysis of the issue at hand. It can be frustrating to discover that no issues were found after offering professional advice. Throughout my experience in the field of monitoring the condition of rotating equipment, I have encountered numerous cases where high 1x amplitude vibrations were caused by issues related to the equipment's mounting. I recommend performing proper soft-foot checks and conducting a detailed inspection of the skid/pedestal on which the unit is mounted. If the problem persists, consider utilizing motion amplification technology to visualize the vibrations. ------------------------------ CELESTINE ESO ------------------------------ Original Message: Sent: 01-11-2024 23:03 From: kishore kumar agguna Subject: Main Engine Auxiliary Blower Vibration Analysis Hello Members, I am seeking your insights on performing vibration analysis on a Ship Main Engine Auxiliary Blower.

            <p>I share Celestine Eso's belief that the issue is likely due to structural looseness on the non-drive end side, particularly in one direction with a single peak at the running frequency. In addition to checking for loose bolts or cracks in the skid/pedestal, a trial can be made by inserting a piece of wood between the two skids to stiffen the structure horizontally, specifically at the furthest point from the bolted interface (below the motor fan area). This might help to assess its impact on the vibration levels. Further information, including the absolute vibration trend, is necessary as suggested by other contributors to conduct a more thorough analysis. Soft-foot checks and a comprehensive inspection of the skid/pedestal are recommended, along with considering motion amplification technology for visualizing the vibration issue if it persists. This proactive approach can potentially uncover underlying causes of high vibration levels related to foot issues and help address them efficiently.</p>

            <p>In a previous comment, it was mentioned that foot-related resonance could be the cause of the issue, possibly stemming from a soft foot condition. To confirm this, use a dual channel analyzer to take Phase and amplitude measurements at the 1x motor speed. Place one transducer on each of the 4 motor feet and the motor base in the vertical plane to compare readings. A 180-degree phase difference between the motor foot and base indicates a soft foot issue. This analysis can help diagnose and address vibration concerns in the Main Engine Auxiliary Blower. Consider using motion amplification technology for visualizing vibrations if the problem persists. Proper soft-foot checks and thorough inspection of the mounting skid/pedestal are recommended to address high amplitude vibrations. By analyzing the absolute vibration trend and conducting these checks, a solution to the issue can be identified.</p>

            <p>Did anyone inspect the motor fan for possible issues? In rare cases, a motor fan impeller can break and cause high 1x vibrations. This issue should be addressed to prevent further damage. Vibration analysis of the ship's main engine auxiliary blower is essential for maintenance and performance optimization. The blower motor is equipped with an online wireless tri-axial vibration sensor for continuous monitoring. Observing a high vibration trend and a dominant 1XR.P.M peak indicates potential unbalance or impeller fouling. It is recommended to open the equipment for inspection to ensure smooth operation. Don't forget to check the attached images for reference.</p>

            <p>It seems like my initial response didn't go through, so I'll provide it again. Here are three essential checks for Ship Main Engine Auxiliary Blower Vibration Analysis. First, conduct a static balance check on the assembled rotor to address any single-plane balance issues caused by a problematic blower impeller. This involves spinning the rotor and observing if it consistently stops in the same position, indicating a need to add weight or remove material for proper balance. Second, perform a lift check on the rotor to assess potential bearing collapse, commonly seen when the cage is on the verge of failing. Third, utilize a Dial Test Indicator (DTI) gauge to inspect for a bent rotor, both vertically and axially on the impeller. Remember, hands-on analysis is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of vibration issues. Good luck with your analysis, Ron.</p>

            <p>I concur with Gareth Ward's observation that the scavenge air is rarely completely clean, which can lead to the accumulation of dirt and oil on the impeller in the engine room. This buildup of dirt typically occurs uniformly, but when the layer becomes too thick, some of it may fall off, causing a sudden unbalanced vibration. It is advisable to regularly clean the rotor, with the frequency determined by the level of dirt in the engine room air.

In a recent discussion about Ship Main Engine Auxiliary Blower Vibration Analysis, the online wireless tri-axial Vibration sensor detected a high vibration trend, particularly a dominant 1XR.P.M peak. Upon inspection, it was recommended to check for unbalance or impeller fouling. Attached are images of the equipment after being opened and examined. ------------------------------ Ron Frend ------------------------------</p>

            <p>Hello Kishore Kumar Agguna, thank you for sharing the information. Please refer to the attached document file containing questions regarding the spectrum image. I kindly request you to focus on expanding the spectrum around the 1x running speed and its harmonics. It would be beneficial to measure the frequency difference between the 1x and its sidebands, as well as 2x and its sidebands, and 3x and its sidebands peaks. Sidebands play a crucial role in analyzing a spectrum, in my humble opinion. It is important to note the actual speed of the motor during data collection, rather than relying solely on the manufacturer's full load frequency displayed on the motor tag. Thank you once again and have a safe and productive day and weekend. Best regards, Ralph Stewart.</p>

            <p>It appears that there may be a resonance issue with the base of your motor blower. It is important to conduct vibration readings and assess the quality of the support system in the vertical direction. Is the motor blower securely mounted on the base? Consider checking for balance and the presence of a fan on the outboard end for reference. Your ship's main engine auxiliary blower vibration analysis is crucial in ensuring smooth operations. Utilizing online wireless tri-axial vibration sensors can help monitor equipment from a distance. If high vibration levels are detected, inspect for unbalance or impeller fouling.
