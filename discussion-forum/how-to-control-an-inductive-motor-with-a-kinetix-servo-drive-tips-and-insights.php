            <p>There are some essential details missing from your inquiry about the Kinetix Drive system. Which specific Kinetix Drive model are you referring to, such as the 300, 5100, 6000, 6500, or 5700? What type of controller is being used, like Control Logix or Compact Logix? How is the motor connected to the drive - does it have an encoder? Have you properly integrated the Kinetix Drive into your I/O configuration and ensured that it is communicating effectively? Have you set up an Axis in the Motion group and defined the motor parameters, scaling, and tuning? When you say the system 'does not run,' do you mean it fails to configure or clear any axis, module, or configuration faults? What are the results when you execute commands like MAFR, MASR, or MSO? Are you utilizing Motion Direct Commands to operate the motor, or are you attempting to control it with programming code?</p>

            <p>I am currently utilizing a Kinetix 5500 drive and a CompactLogix PLC. At the moment, I do not have an encoder connected, only the motor. When I send direct commands and execute the MSO function, the motor becomes active but the shaft remains stationary. However, when I attempt to rotate the shaft by using the MAJ function, nothing occurs.</p>

            <p>Is your MAJ experiencing errors? Have you provided it with a speed reference? What scaling is configured for the drive? Are you inputting the MAJ speed in units or percentage? Check for any MAS instructions that may be running.</p>

            <p>In this discussion, I recommend steering clear of servo systems and opting for a Yaskawa GA800 Vector VFD paired with a Vector duty motor equipped with a 5000 ppr encoder. This setup is not only simpler but also more cost-effective compared to traditional servo systems. I have successfully implemented this solution numerous times, and I have received information that many machine builders are making the switch as well.</p>
