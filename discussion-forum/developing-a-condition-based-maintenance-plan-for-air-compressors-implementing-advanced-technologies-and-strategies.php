            <p>In order to effectively conduct Condition-based Maintenance (CBM), there are four key methods of monitoring equipment condition. These methods include Visual Monitoring (such as regular walk-down checks), Process Monitoring (checking temperature, pressure, flow rates, and pressure drops across air and oil filters), Product Monitoring (assessing the quality of air, for example), and Using Gadgets (such as Vibration Analysis, Oil Analysis, and IR Thermography). A comprehensive CBM program should incorporate a combination of these techniques, rather than solely relying on gadget-based monitoring. Visual monitoring and process monitoring can provide valuable insights into equipment condition without the need for expensive gadgets. By utilizing a combination of these methods, you can gain a deep understanding of the health of your equipment. Regards, Mohammad.</p>

            <p>Mohammad makes valid points regarding the effectiveness of extending oil changes through oil analysis, but this method may not be suitable in all cases. Our experience involved extending the oil changes on a rotary screw by approximately 1000 hours, but I would caution against starting with annual oil analysis without knowing the usage hours and operating conditions. In our case, our units operated 24/7 and we began with quarterly oil sampling. When the recommended oil change hours approached, we would conduct an RPVOT oil analysis to assess the remaining useful life of the oil. Factors such as extreme dirt or heat conditions required particular attention. For instance, we filtered the air entering the air compressor room for one system to protect the equipment from the environment (coal area). Our rotary screw units are continuously monitored for vibration in-house, while operations keep an eye on the parameters mentioned by Mohammad. Proper maintenance of air dryers and compressors is entrusted to a selected air compressor vendor. Reciprocating units are monitored through oil analysis and vibration analysis for larger units. We have found that regular preventive maintenance plays a crucial role in keeping compressors and air dryer systems operating smoothly. Best of luck with your project.</p>

            <p>Monitoring the temperatures of oil, water, and ambient air is crucial for the maintenance of air compressors. Conducting an air leak survey can lead to significant cost savings and potentially reduce the need for some compressors. It is important to visually inspect couplings when units are turned off and use a strobe light to detect any tears or cracks while they are running. Regularly check the cooling fan, differential pressure across the exchanger, and the cleanliness of the exchanger. Solenoid valves in screw compressors play a vital role in removing moisture from the air system. Additionally, it is essential to inspect surge/storage tanks, pressure relief valves, and internal moisture levels in the tank/air system. Consider conducting ultrasonic thickness testing on pressure vessels and checking the pressure capabilities of each piston in recip compressors. Collaborate with compressor suppliers and their field technicians to establish additional monitoring parameters and alarm values.</p>

            <p>The rod drop mechanism on reciprocating compressors is essential for monitoring the condition of rider bands on the piston. Regularly checking the lubrication oil filter delta pressure is crucial. It is important to frequently inspect the valve conditions as well. Monitoring air temperatures at different stages, including outlet and cooler outlets, is recommended. Vibration measurements should be conducted following ISO 10816 part 6 guidelines. Recommendations for parameters and key points are provided within the standard. In addition to predictive maintenance (PDM), preventive maintenance is also beneficial for extending equipment lifespan and identifying potential issues early on. Utilizing tools like Vibmaster can assist in this maintenance process.</p>

            <p>Dave made a valuable point about the importance of conducting acoustic surveys to detect air leaks. I fully support his suggestion to shut down some compressors in order to prevent these leaks. Last year, our Gas plant conducted a leak survey and discovered a significant amount of air leakage that posed a threat to our plant's operation due to air shortages. This was especially critical during peak summer months when all compressors were running. Regards, Mohammad.</p>
