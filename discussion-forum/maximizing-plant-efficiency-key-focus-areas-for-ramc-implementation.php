            <p>Josh, you are on the right track. It's important to understand the impact of operating philosophy on downtime and costs. A key tip is to focus on the basics - keeping equipment clean, dry, and lubricated can yield over 70% of the benefits. Prioritizing tasks using a Risk Matrix can help you plan and schedule work more effectively. Once you have mastered these fundamentals, consider implementing RCM, RBI, and IPF for improved work planning. Remember to measure progress before starting and track all four phases of the improvement cycle - Planning, Scheduling, Execution, and Analysis. Focus on measuring final outputs, such as availability, over intermediate ones like backlog. Best of luck, I believe in your success with the right approach.</p>

            <p>Is it possible to quantify plant reliability during the design phase to ensure smooth operation and minimize downtime? My plant features a highly-integrated system combining reforming and steam systems for optimal efficiency, but this integration has led to extended downtimes and startup procedures. Some suggest adding a packaged boiler to address these issues. Are there tools or software available to calculate plant reliability and availability, either for existing plants or new ones, using reliability block diagrams? While plant efficiency is commonly calculated during design, reliability and availability figures are often overlooked. It is essential to determine if a targeted plant reliability of 97% is feasible through calculations before implementation. Your insights are greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, I can confirm that it is indeed feasible to forecast the project's reliability in advance, especially during the design phase. To do this, you would need to create reliability block diagrams and conduct simulation modeling. Although there are software tools available to assist with this process, it is essential to put in some manual effort initially. Feel free to reach out if you need further guidance.

This involves creating reliability block diagrams and utilizing simulation models. While there are software tools available to assist with this process, a significant amount of manual work is still required. 
In the context of Turnkey projects awarded to contractors, clients may wonder if it is feasible to include a "Reliability Simulation" of the plant within the contract price. If not, they may need to budget a certain percentage of the project cost for this task if outsourced. Assessing the value of this additional expense is crucial. Your insights on this matter would be greatly valued. Regards, William Taylor-Basil.</p>

            <p>When a contractor is awarded a new turnkey project, it is common for the client to expect the contractor to conduct a "reliability simulation" of the plant within the contract price. This practice is regularly carried out by Oil & Gas E&P companies. For a project with a budget of 1 billion USD, the cost of such a simulation can range from 100k to 500k USD, depending on the level of detail required. I have presented a case study in Chapter 34 of my book "100 Years ...." detailing the modeling cost for a USD 100m Power Plant. The article was published on ReliabiliWeb by Terry, but unfortunately, I am unable to provide the URL. Perhaps Terry or Joe Peterson can assist with that. I encourage you to read the article before we continue our discussion.</p>

            <p>Hello Vee, thank you for your response. I am interested in acquiring both of your books. In the meantime, I would value your thoughts on this matter. Our company has been using Maximo from 1996 to 2002, and then switched to Datastream MP5, which we still use today. There are discussions about transitioning to SAP in the future. If we are looking to implement Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), I am curious if SAP has the necessary capabilities to conduct Fault-Tree, RBD, and Markov analyses, and ultimately provide accurate predictions of Life Cycle Costs (after collecting 2-3 years of data) for our Energy from Waste facility (ERF) and Material Recovery Facility (MRF). Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Regards, William</p>

            <p>Laz, have you ever wondered if SAP is equipped to handle Fault-Tree, RBD, Markov analysis, and provide accurate Life Cycle Cost predictions? When I left the industry, SAP R3 had just been upgraded to R4. While R3 lacked the specific capabilities you're looking for, newer versions may have incorporated them as SAP continuously updates its features. If you're seeking these functionalities, alternative software like Reliasoft offers affordable, efficient solutions that can be used offline for your calculations. While my experience with SAP is limited, there are knowledgeable individuals in this forum who can provide more insights on the topic.</p>
