                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I'm curious about how others approach reporting on completed backlogged PMs. For example, in Week 1, there were 10 PMs scheduled and 9 completed, resulting in a 90% completion rate. In Week 2, 10 PMs were scheduled and 11 were completed (10 scheduled + 1 backlog), potentially resulting in a completion rate of 100% or even 110%. How should we interpret this? Should we consider the completion rate for Week 2 as 110% to account for the extra PM completed, or should we adjust the scheduled number to 11 for a 100% completion rate? While the year-end completion rate provides a true percentage of completed PMs out of the total, determining the correct way to report weekly performance is challenging. How do others calculate and handle this situation? Thank you. - Bob</p>

            <p>Hello Bob, I must say I am impressed with your performance in week 2! To enhance your analysis, consider utilizing 3 or 6-month rolling averages. This will provide you with a more dynamic and comprehensive view, rather than just a snapshot in time. Regards, V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, Vee. I understand the importance of focusing on long-term trends over snapshots. However, I am required to report weekly on various PM metrics, including weekly PM completion and year-to-date completion. In regard to backlog completion reporting, should completion percentages exceed 100% to show backlog work completed, or should the number of scheduled PMs be adjusted to stay within a 100% completion limit? Your feedback is appreciated. Thank you, Bob.</p>

            <p>Dear Bob, I am facing an issue with the current metric being used and I believe it is important to make a change rather than just making small adjustments. It is crucial to differentiate between a rolling average and a year-to-date metric. If you are unable to alter the metric, I suggest considering a 110% compliance as a viable option, as that accurately reflects the situation. This scenario often occurs when a project is nearly complete, at 95 or 99%, and is finished the following week. Reporting 110% may lead to your boss wanting to reduce resources. V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>If you are experiencing challenges with planning and scheduling, you are not alone. It is common for changes to be necessary during the execution phase, as perfect planning is often unattainable. To prevent PM completion from exceeding 100%, we have adjusted our scheduling by incorporating backlog PMs into the upcoming week's schedule. This allows us to assess if our manpower can handle the increased workload. It is important to be cautious, as rushing through PM tasks can lead to errors and inefficiencies. Consider spreading out the backlog PMs over several weeks to avoid overwhelming your team. Double-check that the number of PMs scheduled aligns with your available manhours to ensure efficiency. Constant backlog may indicate an issue with workload or staffing levels, requiring a long-term solution. For more insights on PM optimization, refer to our previous posts. Best regards.</p>
