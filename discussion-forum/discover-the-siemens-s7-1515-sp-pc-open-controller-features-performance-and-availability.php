            <p>While I haven't had the opportunity to thoroughly test it, the official specifications indicate that its performance and memory are similar to a 1516 model. Additionally, Siemens has introduced the 1507S version, compatible with certain other Siemens IPCs, which boasts memory and performance comparable to a 1518 model when paired with an i7 processor. This surpasses the capabilities of a 319 model, as mentioned earlier. The processor included is of lower quality and lacks sufficient RAM and storage, especially when compared to modern PCs. It may not be ideal for running resource-heavy programs like Portal. However, it could serve as a convenient platform for integrating PLC and HMI functions on a single device with an external screen. One impressive feature is the ODK (Open Development Kit), which allows for the inclusion of C++ programs that can be accessed by the PLC.</p>

            <p>After spending some time working with the S7-1515SP Open Controller, I can confidently say it has proven to be reliable and durable. Unlike some other models, the 1515SP is made of metal, most likely magnesium, giving it a sturdy feel. Even during operation, it only becomes slightly warm to the touch.

The PLC component of the S7-1515SP is incredibly powerful, possibly surpassing even the 317 model in terms of performance. In my experience, a program that previously ran at around 5 ms on a 315 model now runs at an impressive 1 ms on the 1515SP. The Windows interface, however, leaves something to be desired. While it can handle the WinCC RT HMI adequately, there is a slight delay when switching screens, indicating its limitations in terms of processing power.

One drawback I have encountered is the need to frequently toggle the EWF filter on and off, which can become tedious. Additionally, while the TIA software offers many positive features, there are also some drawbacks that can be frustrating. Overall, working with the TIA component has been both fulfilling and challenging, warranting further discussion.

One major concern I have is the requirement for a high-performance internet connection to be able to go online with the controller. TIA software seems to require more data exchange compared to STEP7 Classic, making it crucial to have a reliable connection. This is particularly important for remote access scenarios via VPN, which is commonly used in our operations.

If anyone else has worked with the S7-1515SP Open Controller and would like to share their experiences, I would appreciate hearing from you.</p>

            <p>One interesting CPU parameter I recently discovered is "enable minimum cycle time for cyclic OBs." This parameter is enabled by default and is set to 1 ms. I have yet to experiment with turning it off, but this could be the reason why the cycle time consistently stays at 1 ms. In the future, I plan to test this parameter with a more demanding program to see how it performs.</p>

            <p>According to JesperMP, the 1515SP is a sturdy and well-built device, constructed from metal (likely magnesium) rather than plastic. During operation, it only becomes slightly warm to the touch, similar to the PG device. JesperMP also noted that the PLC section of the 1515SP is highly robust, potentially even more powerful than the 317 model. After comparing performance metrics with the Open Controller and other Siemens models, JesperMP observed that the 1515SP offers impressive cycle times and accuracy, particularly compared to the older nanoboxes.

In terms of the Windows component, JesperMP found it slightly lacking in performance due to the hardware limitations. The CPU benchmarks revealed that the 1515SP's Dual-Core 1 GHz AMD G Series APU T40E processor is adequate for PLC tasks but falls short in running demanding software alongside the HMI program. While the device allows for IO modules in the rack, it is not as powerful as newer generation models or the Microboxes.

JesperMP also highlighted the inconvenience of having to toggle the EWF filter on and off, mentioning that it is a feature that can be more of a hindrance than a help. Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the device's online functionality, with JesperMP noting that a strong, reliable connection is required for effective remote programming. To mitigate potential issues with slow VPN connections, JesperMP recommended setting up a local PC at the remote site with the necessary software and project data for seamless access and minimal disruptions.

In conclusion, while the 1515SP offers commendable performance as a PLC with some limited PC capabilities, users should be prepared for minor inconveniences with the Windows component and online connectivity challenges when operating remotely. By adopting practical strategies like remote PC installations and project management, users can maximize the device's functionality and efficiency.</p>

            <p>Is the price still around 1800 euros? I can't give an opinion on the controller, but I wanted to share my experience with the TIA software. There are both positive and negative aspects to it. Working with the TIA part can be both satisfying and frustrating, which could be a topic for another discussion. My main concern at the moment is the need for a reliable internet connection to be online with TIA. It appears to transfer more data than STEP7 Classic, and the online concept is different. What if you have a slow VPN connection to a distant site? This is something we frequently encounter. If this doesn't work well, it could be a major drawback.

It's interesting because I've recently switched back to Step7 after using TIA for a while, and I find myself struggling with certain aspects. Why can't I easily copy things over? Arrays are not as efficient... Importing to a panel is challenging. The software still has its flaws, and the response time could be improved. However, I believe the engineering time is shorter overall, thanks to its useful features. Once you get used to it, the software can significantly speed up processes (patience is required).

We have been using it since version 10.5, and most of our stations are on gprs-VPN connections. Despite being slow to establish and start monitoring, it is stable and reliable. We have connected to them numerous times without issues. If the process allows, we increase the communication percentage. Overall, there shouldn't be many concerns about using it.</p>

JesperMP worries that having a slow VPN connection to a remote site may pose challenges when trying to access the PLC online, especially considering their extensive use of VPNs.

A drawback JesperMP pointed out is that as the program size increases, the online view startup becomes slower and more data is transferred in TIA due to downloading the full header information of the entire online program. Making any changes to the program requires going offline and then back online, resulting in the repeated transfer of data.

JesperMP suggests that having the option to disable the "compare always the complete program" feature in TIA, with the default setting off, would be beneficial. STEP7 Classic only compares the timestamp and block checksum of the specific block being viewed. Siemens made online performance modifications in V13 SP1, but JesperMP hopes for further improvements from Siemens in the future.</p>

            <p>Thomas_v2 suggested adding an option to disable the default "compare always the complete program" feature, as not everyone may find it necessary. In Step7/Classic, the comparison is based on timestamp and block checksum of individual blocks. With the online performance modification in classic S7 with V13 SP1 by Siemens, there is hope for a fix in the future. In newer S7 versions like 1200/1500, checksum calculations for individual blocks may no longer be used, making comparisons complicated. Having to compare multiple timestamps and header info for each block can lead to false differences. I am optimistic for improvements in v14, with the addition of checksums for better security. Despite its shortcomings like crashes and bloat, I still prefer Portal over Simatic Manager for its user-friendly interface.</p>

            <p>I am planning to look into the system clock to obtain more accurate cycle time information out of curiosity. The approximate list price for the version without the bundled HMI is as stated by m_turk. In my opinion, opting for the bundled HMI package offers a cost-effective solution, providing a robust PLC (similar to a 317) along with an industrial-grade PC for the HMI software, Windows licenses, and WinCC RT licenses, all at a fraction of the cost compared to a conventional solution.</p>

            <p>Hello Jesper, I was wondering if connecting the HMI to a SCADA requires assigning one of the ethernet ports as a dedicated HMI port. Your insight on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Interface88, what is meant by 'connecting HMI to a SCADA'? Does this refer to allowing a SCADA system to access the HMI tags of a WinCC RT running on the 1515SP PC? This can be achieved by configuring the WinCC RT as an OPC Server, although I do not have prior experience in this aspect. Alternatively, does this refer to 'connecting the open controller PLC to a SCADA'? If so, if the SCADA system is connected to the port designated for the open controller (X1), no special actions are required. However, if the SCADA system is connected to the Windows-port (X2), routing must be set up between the Windows section and the open controller using virtual Ethernet ports in the configuration. Please refer to this guide for detailed instructions: [Link to guide on routing setup].</p>
