                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have been pondering a pressing issue lately and am seeking advice on best practices and insights. I am currently dealing with a plant that has a large DH+ network which is causing numerous problems. Initially designed for a small packaging line, the network has since expanded to encompass approximately 30 nodes. This extensive network layout seems inefficient to me, lacking smaller sub-networks for specific equipment communication needs. Covering 3 production lines and various support equipment, I have also observed circular connections such as both a & b channels connected on a DHRIO bridge.

Before devising a plan for moving forward, I believe it is crucial to map the physical layout of the network to gain a comprehensive understanding. I intend to utilize a software called NetDecoder to identify machines communicating with each other and compile a list of message instructions in use. However, I am facing a challenge in tracing the actual cables. My current plan involves unplugging all connections when the system is down and using a cable tracer on each connection, but the thought of potentially missing a controller and damaging the communication port makes me apprehensive. Given the size of the facility, this method seems impractical and time-consuming.

Has anyone encountered a similar situation or can offer any suggestions for tackling this issue effectively?</p>

            <p>I once had a customer with around 20 nodes connected, which I initially thought was too many. The number of nodes depends on the amount of data being passed through. DH+ works by transmitting data in a single puck from node to node. To optimize performance, I recommend splitting the data into 3 pucks - one for each production line. If budget allows, consider adding a bridge to divert some traffic to Ethernet.

DH+ is known for its industrial strength and reliability. If you encounter issues, ensure that terminal resistors are in place at the end nodes. If problems persist, it may be due to an excessive number of nodes or data overload.

My customer had a significant amount of data, with new recipes being loaded every few hours. These recipes included various temperature, pressure, and vacuum ramps, which could potentially cause performance issues.</p>

            <p>In order to troubleshoot the connections at a large facility, one suggestion is to disconnect all cables while the systems are offline and use a cable tracer on each connection. However, this method can be daunting as there is a fear of missing a controller and damaging the communication port. It may seem like a time-consuming task, but it is important for ensuring proper functionality.

To simplify the process, consider using RSLinx to access the network and identify all active nodes. From there, create a map of the network by determining which devices are communicating with each other. This task may prove to be challenging, but it is crucial for maintaining a smooth operation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to geniusintraining, DH+ served as a reliable industrial network that can withstand wiring mistakes to some extent. However, optimal performance is achieved with proper wiring. The network is designed to be a daisy chain without any tees or branches, and should have a terminating resistor at each end. While it may function in unconventional setups with branches and stars, this is not recommended.

To troubleshoot network issues, it is advisable to follow geniusintraining's suggestion and use RSLinx to explore the network while it is operational. This will help identify connected devices and channels. However, assessing the cabling arrangement requires physically tracing the cables. Start visually and use a tracer if cables disappear into complex wiring setups or conduits. Note the position of each conductor when disconnecting cables to ensure correct reconnection, as inconsistent connections can lead to functionality issues and unnecessary troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>I recently encountered a similar situation and ended up having to trace the wires to resolve it. While Net Decoders is highly regarded as top Industrial communication software, it lacks the capability to map network cabling. I'm curious if the DH+ network experienced deterioration after the addition of DHRIOs. In my experience, the PLC 5 / SLC built-in DH+ ports were more reliable and powerful compared to DHRIO. I recall reading a white paper recommending the use of only one channel for DH+ communications and keeping the other channel off, as well as limiting the attachment of devices to a single 1756-DHRIO card to 16. If I come across the paper, I'll make sure to provide the link here. Good luck with your situation.</p>

            <p>Struggling with how to use multi-quote? Users like @joseph_e2 have faced similar issues due to using non-standard cables with different colors, leading to incorrect connections by vendors. They eventually resorted to running new cables to fix the problem. 

Initially a small packaging line, the system has evolved to connect various machines to conveyors and other equipment in the plant. @Jmeadows7676 made a valid point about channel 1 that could be worth exploring further, especially given the plant's history of brownouts and power losses.

It seems that during power outages, one PLC may be reverting to node 1, causing a duplicate node and disrupting the network across all 3 lines. The plant experiences difficulties restarting afterwards, indicating a recurring issue that needs to be addressed.</p>

The default DH+ address is set by dip switches on channel "1A" during Powerup for PLC 5, while the address for DHRIO cards is set using dip switches as well.
