                    <p>As a newcomer in the field of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), I am interested in learning how to automate an overhead gantry crane using Siemens or B&R PLC systems. What equipment and components are necessary for this type of automation? My goal is to control four motors using inverters and integrate a conveyor belt into the system. When the conveyor belt is empty, the crane moves to pick up an object which is then manually secured by an operator. The crane then places the object onto the conveyor belt. Additionally, I plan to incorporate a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for easier operation. I would appreciate any insights or guidance on implementing this automation setup. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Having completed numerous projects like this before, I can assure you that it is not a task for beginners. However, if you are up for the challenge, there are a few key recommendations to keep in mind. Firstly, I highly recommend using Magnetek drives specifically designed for crane duty, as they outperform standard VFDs. Incorporating a laser positioning system will ensure precise positioning, while a reliable PLC, preferably with AB processors, should be used to manage operations. Additionally, it is advisable to have manual control directly linked to the drives for added security in case of any issues. Opting for radio controls over pendant or cable systems is also recommended to avoid potential long-term problems. If you find this overwhelming, feel free to reach out to me for professional design assistance.</p>

            <p>Beginners should avoid attempting this task due to potential risks associated with swinging masses causing damage to objects and individuals. The key technique involved in this process is known as input shaping. Peter considers the use of PID - InputShaping essential for achieving optimal results.

Input shaping is commonly utilized in industries such as cranes, where it is necessary to move a vibrating or swinging load into position without any oscillations. My instructional video on YouTube provides a detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts involved in this technique, which is crucial for successful implementation.

One of our customers was inspired by my video and successfully applied the mathematical concepts on a RMC system. An example of input shaping control can be seen in action with an overhead crane at HCMUT.

While input shaping effectively eliminates sway angles of payloads, it may result in a longer duration for the move due to one oscillation cycle. A bit of history behind this technique involves a former student from MIT, Mark Singhose, who pitched the idea to us in Eugene OR. Despite initial limitations in our older motion controllers, our current third-generation controller is now capable of implementing this algorithm.

Mark Singhose has since become a professor at Georgia Tech, specializing in input shaping among other subjects. His doctoral thesis, which I possess, contains errors that were identified by me but overlooked by his PhD advisors.

Ultimately, while input shaping may not be suitable for beginners, its effectiveness and applications have been well-documented in various industries.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey cautioned against inexperienced individuals attempting a technique that involves moving swing masses, as it can pose risks to both objects and people. The solution lies in a method known as input shaping. This control strategy, commonly utilized in crane operations, is essential for positioning vibrating or swinging loads smoothly without causing oscillations.

My video presentation delves into the mathematical concepts behind input shaping, showcasing its practical applications. While the process may seem complex, it is manageable with the right understanding. However, implementing it on a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) may not be advisable.

Notably, a customer who viewed my video successfully applied the input shaping algorithm on a RMC system. An example of this technique in action can be seen in the control of an Overhead crane, as demonstrated in a video from HCMUT.

The idea of input shaping was brought to my attention by Mark Singhose, a former MIT student, who sought to introduce the concept to our company years ago. Despite the limitations of our earlier motion controllers, advancements in technology have enabled us to integrate this algorithm effectively.

Despite its effectiveness, input shaping does have a drawback – it can extend the duration of a move by one oscillation cycle. This method was even considered for the Space Shuttle arm but lost out to the Canada Arm developed by a team from MIT.

In a real-world scenario, an automated pipe transfer crane at a ductile iron pipe plant showcased the effective use of input shaping to handle heavy loads securely. By strategically lifting to maximum height with each pick, the sway issues were minimized, allowing for smooth and precise transfers using a PLC5 system.</p>
