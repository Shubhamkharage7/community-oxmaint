            <p>There are numerous solutions available for addressing vertical pump resonance issues, however, reducing the length may not necessarily improve performance. I am curious as to the origin of this unconventional suggestion and whether it is backed by any factual evidence. -Walt</p>

            <p>Making the decision to remove a vertical column from a pump can significantly affect its performance, potentially leading to a decrease in efficiency. It is strongly advised to consult with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) before making any modifications to avoid any negative impacts on the pump's operation. Regards, Mohammad.</p>

            <p>I want to express my gratitude to Walt and Mohammad for their concern. We have made the necessary adjustment by removing the second column, leaving only two columns installed (the first and third, near the bowl). As a result, the natural frequency has shifted from 19.8 to 22.5 Hz. The pump is no longer experiencing high vibration due to resonance, and it has been running smoothly for over 2 months now, compared to its previous lifespan of only 2 months. Additionally, the discharge pressure and temperature are within acceptable levels. Thank you, Am.</p>

            <p>It is important to verify the wet well level for inconsistencies, especially after raising the intake bowl, to ensure that there is sufficient positive suction head for the pump at maximum drawdown.</p>

            <p>Amorz, it is important to regularly check the Motor current and bearing temperatures. If you recently adjusted the NPSH by removing a column (especially the middle one) without altering the liquid level, the motor could experience increased current and run hotter due to the low NPSH. Changing the NPSH also affects discharge pressure, leading to shifts in bearing load and potentially higher bearing temperatures. Best of luck with the modification. Regards, Mohammad.</p>

            <p>Hello Mohammad, I make sure to regularly check the current and temperature of the bearings. Currently, the motor current is 114A at a valve opening of 95%, and it was 141A before any deductions at 100% valve opening. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
