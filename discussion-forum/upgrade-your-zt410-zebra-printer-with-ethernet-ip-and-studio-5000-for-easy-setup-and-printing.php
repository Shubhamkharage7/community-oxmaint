                    <p>Hello everyone! I recently received a new software package for my ZT410 Zebra printer, which includes firmware updates for the printer port (EIP) and an Add On Profile (AOP), along with detailed setup instructions. Setting up the printer is a breeze, whether you're using a 2D code like a QR code or a traditional barcode. Simply design your label using ZebraDesigner software, save it to the printer's flash memory, transfer ASCII characters to your PLC's printer buffer, and then send the data to your printer - it's that simple!

            <p>Recently, there has been a buzz around Zebra printers. After seeing discussions online and working on a project involving a Zebra printer myself, I realized the importance of utilizing efficient methods for printing labels. In my project, I automated the process of printing labels by triggering it when a specific event occurred in the CompactLogix PLC. To simplify the task, I opted to use the ZebraDesigner software, a user-friendly tool that allows for visual designing of labels. By utilizing the Print To File function, I generated the ZPL code required for the label. Additionally, I developed a parser for AdvancedHMI to extract data from the ZPL file and replace specific placeholders with the relevant information. Ultimately, the finalized ZPL string was sent directly to the Zebra printer for printing. This streamlined process not only saved time but also ensured accuracy in label printing.</p>

            <p>The application I submitted was a revision of a previous implementation that was in place before I became involved in the system maintenance. The previous setup utilized WonderWare to monitor the PLC bit, which then collected data and transmitted it to an OmniServer through OPC, and finally to the Zebra printer. Issues with this setup occurred about once a month, causing the printer to stop functioning. Problems ranged from OPC errors to Wonderware license issues, and even OmniServer going into demo mode after a power outage, shutting down every 2 hours. If considering the WW->OmniServer->Zebra printer solution, it may be wise to explore alternative options. Feel free to update me on the progress of your AdvancedHMI project. Is this system located in Colombia?</p>

Hello everyone,

I recently obtained a software package for my ZT410 Zebra printer, which includes firmware for printer port (EIP), AOP (add-on profile), and setup instructions. Setting up the printer is a breeze - whether you're using 2D codes like QR codes or traditional barcodes. Simply design your label on ZebraDesigner software, transfer it to the printer's flash memory, copy ASCII characters to your PLC's printer buffer, and send the data to your printer. Easy as pie!

            <p>Our system integrates Intermec and Zebra printers by storing printer codes in an SQL server. A Windows service continuously monitors PLCs for print requests, detecting triggers in the PLC and reading PLC tags to generate printed tags. This service then communicates via WCF to a printer handler service, which uses the tag data as parameters in a stored procedure call. The stored procedure retrieves the complete printer string, allowing the print handler service to direct the print job to the appropriate printer. Any modifications or updates can be made seamlessly in real-time through SQL.</p>

Relying solely on a PLC for printer management can be challenging as it may not be the most efficient tool for the job. Choosing an industrial IT solution over an automation solution could offer better long-term benefits and performance.</p>

            <p>Attention everyone...In case you are interested, the developer's package from 'widelto' has been shared with me, and most of its contents can be found on the Zebra website. Unfortunately, the kit itself cannot be located easily; its unique part number is CAG-P1096531 and it includes various components. Strangely, even distributors seem unaware of its specific contents, making it difficult to procure. Allow for a few days for delivery, as it also comes with Z Points for printer downloads. Ensure that you purchase enough points to cover all your downloads – for instance, I estimate needing 2700 points for setting up nine printers. Please fact-check this information, as it could be beneficial to you in a broader sense.</p>

            <p>Recently, I completed a project that involved setting up a Zebra ZT230 printer to communicate with a CompactLogix PLC via Ethernet IP. To facilitate this, I utilized ZDownloader software to flash the firmware. In order to proceed, I had to input my license key to unlock 300 Z-points. However, obtaining the necessary firmware and license key proved to be a bureaucratic ordeal. Thankfully, our printer supplier is currently in the process of providing us with printers that come pre-installed with LinkOS firmware.</p>

            <p>I have a love-hate relationship with Zebra Printers. They can be quite finicky, especially when paired with the Weber applicator. In my workplace, I became the go-to person for fixing these printers and getting them running smoothly. Most of the time, it required some IT magic to get them working properly. Dealing with the tension issues in the belt assembly and the hassle of removing and reinserting the ZE500's was a real headache. To make matters worse, the custom labeling software used by my employer was a mess.

Despite these challenges, I built strong connections with key individuals who could assist me when needed. The helpdesk team knew to follow my instructions and send issues directly to the right people. In urgent situations where production was at stake, I bypassed the helpdesk and contacted my trusted contacts directly.

Thanks to my extensive IT background, I was often spot-on with troubleshooting and fixing issues. I was the only person in the plant who could navigate the complexities of the systems and networks involved. If my initial solution didn't work, I knew exactly which group to turn to for further investigation.

Overall, my expertise and proactive approach saved the day on numerous occasions. Despite the challenges posed by Zebra Printers and complex software, I was able to consistently resolve issues and keep operations running smoothly.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I recently joined this platform after stumbling upon a discussion about Zebra's Network Connect, which allows for the use of industrial protocols. Not every Zebra partner is authorized to offer this product, so they may not be equipped to address your inquiries. To access this feature, make sure to order printers with the Network Connect license pre-installed or obtain the license from a certified partner. Upon ordering the license, expect a processing time of a few weeks before receiving a firmware download and license key. Simply input the license key into the firmware downloader to download the specialized firmware onto your printer, enabling the industrial protocols.</p>

            <p>After working with an integrator to set up assembly cells, we decided to use Zebra ZT230 printers due to their Ethernet capability. However, this decision led to numerous issues, including random printer lock-ups and unhelpful tech support from Zebra. I eventually switched to using an RTA Automation module, the 435USB, to convert Ethernet to USB. This simplified the programming process and improved printing reliability, although we no longer receive printer status updates. Despite the initial learning curve of working with ZPL code, the new setup has proven to be more efficient. Our labels now feature part numbers, operator codes, time and date information, and a DataMatrix barcode. This experience has solidified my belief that troubleshooting technical issues can feel like a never-ending punishment.</p>

            <p>RTA - Reliable and Deterministic

MikeyN shared his experience with integrating Zebra ZT230 printers into assembly cells, facing random lock-ups despite proper configuration. Seeking a solution, he switched to RTA Automation's 435USB module, simplifying the process from 20 to 3 programming rungs. The module seamlessly converts Ethernet to USB, making printing more reliable with ASCII ZPL code transfer.

Transitioning to RTA proved beneficial, eliminating the need for complex programming and ensuring seamless data transfer into PLC tags. Unlike struggling with Ethernet configurations, the RTA module simplifies the process, making printing operations more efficient and reliable for operators. The transition to using RTA modules has been a game-changer, providing a hassle-free solution for integrating printers in assembly cells.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I have successfully sent data to the Zebra ZD420 printer from my Allen-Bradley 1769-L16ER-BB1B PLC using the following manual: Rockwell Automation's Ethernet Communication Setup Guide (https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/at/enet-at002_-en-p.pdf). To achieve this, I utilized the Message block (msg) to establish a connection through the ethernet port and transmit ASCII characters, which represent the ZPL II code. This method eliminates the need for special firmware. Cheers!</p>

            <p>I need to send more than 5 data tags from my L24ER PLC to a ZD410 printer and translate them into Spanish. While sending up to 5 data values is simple, using the raw parser method for more than 5 seems complicated.

            <p>When working with a CompactLogix, you can easily send ZPL code to a Zebra Printer using a MSG instruction by configuring a socket connection for TCP/IP. An example in the knowledgebase demonstrates how to modify the "FD" ZPL instruction by concatenating strings. Sending text in MSG through a Socket is all that is required. I successfully utilized a CompactLogix L16 for this task, and the L24 should also work smoothly. To send the MSG 20 times for different values, simply create a logic to repeat the process.</p>

I'm unsure if I can send MSG commands to the printer, as it is already equipped with the necessary firmware for AB Ethernet/IP communications. I attempted an example but did not receive a printout. I thought I only needed to adjust the IP address (192.168.1.206?port=9100) and the EWEB_Path ($01$00). After making these changes and toggling the test bit, I still couldn't get anything to print. I suspect it may be related to the firmware update on this device. If I'm overlooking something, please let me know for further guidance.

Widelto, I could use your help with the raw parser method. My label incorporates FN1-FN3 and then FN6-FN23. I need a simple way to input data into the raw parser tag and send it out as a whole. Since my tags are typically Reals and DINTs, I assume I must first convert them to a string before inserting them between ^FN6^FD and ^FS. Do you have a sample code that demonstrates how to load data into the parser tags (if that's what you did)? Thank you for all your assistance.</p>

Do you happen to have a sample code demonstrating how to load data into the parser tags (if this was the approach you took)? Thank you for all your assistance.

Upon further reflection, it appears that the solution may lie in the fact that you do not have the EDS of the Zebra Printer, and it is running on Conventional firmware. Unfortunately, as I have not utilized the Zebra printer in this manner before, I am unable to provide assistance in this specific scenario.</p>

            <p>JoelTorres26 shared: I now have a better understanding. The issue seems to be that you do not have the EDS of the Zebra Printer and it is running on Conventional firmware. Unfortunately, I have not encountered this scenario before, so I am unable to assist you at this time. Thank you for your help nonetheless. Perhaps I will consider your method in the future. Acquiring the printer with the upgraded firmware significantly increased my expenses.</p>

            <p>widelto mentioned that when starting this discussion, the goal was to avoid dealing with ZPL code and sockets. However, it appears that things have become more complicated than anticipated. The project involves four weight stations utilizing hardy platform scales, AdvancedHMI software on a PC as the HMI, and a PLC model 1769-L30ER. QR codes need to be printed from all four stations with up to 10 different variables every 20 seconds or less. If you have any inquiries, feel free to contact me. It is worth noting that if AdvancedHMI is being used, there is no need to invest in Zebra Enet/IP firmware; instead, the Zebra LinkOS SDK can be utilized.</p>

            <p>BachPhi mentioned that users of AdvancedHMI do not need to purchase Zebra Enet/IP firmware and can instead utilize Zebra's LinkOS SDK for printing. I appreciate the advice. Our standard hardware includes a CompactLogix L24ER and Panelview Plus 7 HMI. However, I am unfamiliar with using a printer in this context. We also operate a system with Siemens S7-1214 PLC and TP700 HMI, using a Gebe printer that functions adequately. Finding a suitable printing solution for AB systems has always posed a challenge. Despite attending the AB Automation fair in Philadelphia recently, I found that their printer options were outdated and representatives did not offer a satisfactory solution for printing from an HMI.</p>

            <p>Hello, it seems like I am encountering issues with my ZT410 printer. While I am able to ping the printer, the RSling is unable to recognize it. I am in need of the special firmware for download, but I am having trouble locating it. Can someone please provide me with the firmware along with any necessary instructions? You can reach me at [email protected] Thank you.

The Ethernet/IP driver for the ZT410 printer is not free and is restricted to 1 printer per driver. With over 40 printers, the vendor requested $500 for each driver, which we found unreasonable. As a solution, we opted to utilize Ignition for printing to our Zebra printers. If you require the driver, it is recommended to reach out to the Zebra representative in your area as they should be able to offer the driver for purchase.</p>

            <p>In addition, I developed a parsing tool for AdvancedHMI to locate specific data within brackets in the ZPL file (generated in ZebraDesigner software). This tool extracted the data within the brackets and used it as a tag name to fetch corresponding information for replacement. The modified ZPL string was subsequently forwarded straight to the printer for processing.</p>

            <p>One effective solution for managing a zebra printer is to utilize a server for the downloading of labels. The most efficient method of communication is through TCP/IP or socket communications between the PLC and the server. The PLC will simply scan the box, transmit information to the server, track the box to the printer, and prompt the application of the label. After scanning and verifying the label, the PLC will relay the information to the server to determine if it is a good label or not, allowing for the decision to divert the box into a reject lane or proceed straight to packaging. This streamlined process ensures smooth operation and accuracy in labeling.</p>

            <p>In a discussion, Pete.S. expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the zebra solution for demanding applications with multiple label variations. He noted the limitations of using only a PLC for printer control, suggesting that an industrial IT solution would be more suitable. Despite over 3 years and 38K views, the debate continues to gain momentum.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I've been following your discussions on connecting a Beckhoff PLC with a Zebra ZT610 printer. I'm wondering if any of you have had to customize the label design in Zebra Designer to ensure the variable text input matches the variable names in the PLC for accurate label information. 

Currently, I have created the label file using Zebra Design Essentials 3. After printing the file and converting it to .zpl format using an online zpl viewer, I can successfully test print the label by communicating with the printer through Zebra utilities software. However, I am facing issues with getting the correct label information to display when the PLC triggers the print command. The printer is connected to the Beckhoff PLC using Tcp/IP settings for the port.

Any suggestions or insights on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello @widelto, I urgently need your help with sending the firmware file and program code. I am facing a problem with my PLC and have very little time to solve it.

Hello everyone, I recently received a new software package for my ZT410 Zebra printer. This package includes firmware for the printer port (EIP), AOP (add on profile), and instructional documents for setting up the printer. Setting up the printer is a simple process, whether you are using a 2D code like QR code or a barcode. All you need to do is design your label using ZebraDesigner software, send it to the printer's flash memory, copy ASCII characters to your PLC's printer buffer, and then send the data to your printer. 

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the attached files.</p>

            <p>Arturo Morales recommended: "Take a look at this example, it helped me understand all the data that was requested. You can download it here: http://www.vdt-automation.ru/files/kb32962.pdf. The important thing to note is that the PLC is the client sending the data and the printer is the server, not the other way around. You can find the port by accessing the printer's settings. Check it out." Can you provide more details about your application since the link you shared is no longer accessible?</p>
