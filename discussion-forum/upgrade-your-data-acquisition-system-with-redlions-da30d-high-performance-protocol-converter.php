                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>My current system is outdated and reaching the end of its service life, but since it is still functional, management is hesitant to replace it. The HMI is running on an XP machine with Lookout software, posing a potential risk in the future. To ensure data capture for when the system eventually fails, I am considering adding a DA30D to store historical data and restore the system to its previous state. There is a vague recollection from an engineer who worked here 20 years ago, mentioning that the system could not be networked, hence the need for a crossover cable. After reviewing the manual, it seems that adding a switch to connect the PLC, computer, and Redlion may not be feasible. Is this information accurate?

            <p>The manual diagram shows a 171-CCS-760-00, but the photo displays a 171-CCC-960-30, which indicates a significant difference in connectivity. The former features an RJ45 RS232 serial port, while the latter comes equipped with an Ethernet RJ45 port. According to the manual, the 171-CCC-960-30 has an industry-standard pinout, making it compatible with prefab patch cables. It is unclear why a crossover cable is required if the processor adapter should be able to communicate over a network through a switch without any issues.</p>
