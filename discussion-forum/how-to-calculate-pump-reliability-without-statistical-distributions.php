            <p>It appears no one has responded yet. Allow me to illustrate with an example: if a pump fails 3 times in one year with a mission of 8760 hours, how can we calculate its reliability without relying on a statistical distribution? Does anyone have the answer to this question?</p>

            <p>Reliability can be defined as the likelihood of a successful mission. When pump failures are random, the mean failure rate is around 0.000342 failures per hour. This allows for the calculation of reliability for any given mission length. For example, for a 1,000-hour mission, the reliability R of a pump can be calculated as R = exp(-0.000342*1,000) â‰ˆ 0.710017. This means that there is a 71% chance the pump will not fail during a 1,000-hour period. The reliability will adjust accordingly based on the duration of the mission. Is this in line with your expectations? Rui</p>

            <p>Thank you, Rui. You are currently employing an exponential distribution to determine the reliability of a system under the assumption of a constant failure rate.

            <p>Hey Rui, I wanted to discuss the setup of my main and standby pumps on a 90-10 basis. The duty pump is expected to run 90% of the time, which translates to approximately 0.9 * 8760 hours per year. On the other hand, the standby pump is expected to run 10% of the time, which is around 0.1 * 8760 hours annually. Have you considered the combined reliability of both pumps in this scenario?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your inquiry, Svanels. While I am unsure of the specific conversation thread on this topic, I wanted to share a brief comment following Lucas's remark. It is important to consider factors such as reliability, availability, and costs when determining the effectiveness of a 90-10% pump regimen. When operating with two pumps - one as the duty pump and the other as the standby pump - it is crucial to understand that their mission time is equal. The duty pump operates 90% of the time while the standby pump operates for the remaining 10%, swapping roles when necessary. This system ensures that if one pump fails, the other can easily take its place while repairs are being made. I hope this explanation clarifies any confusion. Best regards, Rui.</p>

            <p>In the forum discussion on operating philosophy, we also touched upon the topic of the Best Strategy. Your assertion regarding the mission time being the same for both the main and standby pumps is quite straightforward. While the main pump's primary mission is to function effectively, the standby pump is designated as a backup, regardless of the time. This distinction is crucial in ensuring operational efficiency and preparedness in case of any unforeseen circumstances.</p>

            <p>Luca, do you have a different perspective on the definition? Rui Assis originally stated, "Reliability is defined as the probability of success for a certain mission." If reliability is based on probability, is it necessary to search for alternative mathematical methods or procedures for its calculation?</p>

            <p>There are alternative methods to assess reliability beyond using a probability distribution formula. One option is to utilize addition, such as adding 9 multiple times to reach a total of 81. However, personally, I find multiplying 9 by 9 to be a more preferable approach.</p>

            <p>I am comfortable using statistical distributions, but I am looking for an algebraic formula that is easy for my management to understand. It seems that managers prefer simplicity when it comes to calculations. While exploring further, I discovered that availability, a statistical parameter, can be calculated using the formula MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR). I am curious if there is a similar formula for reliability. Where do managers study anyway? It appears they struggle to comprehend anything beyond basic algebraic calculations like x+-/.</p>

            <p>I am interested in finding an algebraic formula for determining reliability. If we use an exponential distribution, the reliability of a one-year mission can be calculated as R=exp(-N) where N represents the number of failures. In the case of N=3, the reliability is 50%. What are your thoughts on this approach?</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering the example of having 3 failures in a year, it is important to understand the patterns and probabilities at play. For instance, if a component has been failing every 4 months and the last failure was 2 months ago, the likelihood of another failure within the next 3 months is 100%. However, if the failures occur at irregular intervals with no apparent pattern, it may seem unpredictable. Only through investigation can it be revealed that the failures are due to chance occurrences, such as random events like a stone hitting a car's windshield.

By analyzing the time intervals between failures and applying the exponential probability function, a mathematical pattern can be observed. This function, commonly used in various scenarios like waiting lines and system failures, can help determine the probability of success or failure within a specific timeframe. It is important to note that relying solely on a suggested formula may not always be accurate.

In conclusion, understanding the probabilistic nature of failures and utilizing mathematical models like the exponential probability function can aid in predicting and managing reliability. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out. Regards, Rui</p>

            <p>In response to Rui's statement, it is important to note that when using the exponential distribution, the probability of success (reliability) or failure can be determined for a specific time period (such as running hours, miles, cycles, etc.). The formula suggested by Rui is incorrect. If we consider an exponential distribution, the reliability for a one-year time mission can be calculated as R=exp(-N), where N represents the number of failures. In our example, with N=3, the reliability would be 50%. To clarify further, the calculation would be: R=exp(-(3/8760)*8760)=exp(-3)=exp(-N). Apologies for any confusion, but it appears there was a misunderstanding in the previous email.</p>

            <p>Just kidding, don't be upset. Let's revisit my question about reliability. The reliability factor represents the probability of success. If we analyze historical data to calculate reliability, consider this example with a popular pump that experienced 3 failures in 2005. The reliability can be computed as rel=exp(-3) using an exponential distribution, which is a statistical method. Does this calculation seem accurate to you, or do you have a more effective approach?</p>

            <p>Are you looking for a Maintenance Engineering Manager who can effectively oversee and maintain equipment and plant facilities worth millions of dollars? Our ideal candidate is experienced in applying various scientific and engineering principles to equipment, managing maintenance budgets exceeding $$$ million, and supervising a team of engineers and technical professionals. They should be able to effectively communicate with colleagues from different backgrounds and handle complex mathematical formulas, such as R = exp (- N * t). As someone who learned to use exponential functions in High School with a basic calculator, I believe that those who struggle with this concept may not have the necessary qualifications for a leadership role in maintenance engineering. With my Bachelor's in Industrial Engineering and ongoing pursuit of a Master's degree, I am confident in my abilities to excel as a Director or President in this field.</p>

            <p>When assessing reliability, one commonly used metric is the mean time between failures (MTBF) of a pump. The MTBF for your pump is calculated to be 2920 hours, indicating the average time it takes for a failure to occur. However, it's important to note that this number doesn't guarantee the pump will fail every 2920 hours, as the actual failure pattern may vary. To delve deeper into this, statistical methods can be employed to analyze the failure distribution. For instance, if failures are assumed to be random, an exponential distribution can be used. Understanding the failure distribution allows us to determine the probability of the equipment functioning as intended at a specific time, expressed as a percentage.

For example, if through effective maintenance the pump experiences fewer failures, decreasing from 3 to 2 per year, the MTBF would increase to 4380 hours. This improvement indicates a higher level of reliability compared to the initial MTBF of 2920 hours. To further understand the likelihood of failure, a detailed statistical analysis is recommended.</p>

            <p>Luca, Snap Ring is correct in pointing out the importance of statistics in dealing with uncertainty. When faced with an uncertain situation, statistics provide us with the tools to analyze and make informed decisions. For example, if you have observed 3 failures in a period of 8,760 hours, it is essential to carefully note the time elapsed between each failure. By analyzing this data, we can identify the type of failure and estimate its parameters with confidence intervals.

If we assume that the failures are occurring randomly, we can apply the exponential distribution with a failure rate of 0.000342 failures per hour. Using this information, we can calculate the reliability of a system over a given period of time. For instance, the reliability of a system not experiencing a new failure within 1,000 hours would be 0.710017.

In a scenario where failures occur at regular intervals, such as every four months, the reliability of a system can vary depending on the timing of the last failure. If the next mission is scheduled for one month from now, the reliability would be 0. However, if the mission is delayed to three months, the reliability would be 100%, as the system has proven to be reliable during that timeframe.

In conclusion, statistics play a crucial role in understanding and managing uncertainties in various scenarios. By employing statistical methods, we can make informed decisions and optimize system reliability. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask. Regards, Rui.</p>

            <p>Luca, possessing knowledge in both theory and practice, allows you to understand the distinction between deterministic and probabilistic processes. Deterministic processes, such as chemical reactions and dynamics governed by definable equations, yield predictable outcomes. On the other hand, probabilistic processes, like failures and accidents, follow gaming laws and are best analyzed using statistical methods. Attempting to simplify these processes with algebraic or arithmetic expressions is equivalent to forcing a square peg into a round hole. Rui and others are diligently working to address your inquiries, with Rui even developing a simulation model for this purpose. Their efforts deserve recognition, as acknowledged by Eugene and Svanels. However, it may be difficult to fully satisfy your query as you seem inclined to disregard the statistical aspect of probabilistic problems.</p>
