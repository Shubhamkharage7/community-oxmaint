            <p>Hello Rennie, The OREDA database is a valuable resource for HVAC data in the oil and gas industry. Although access to the full database is restricted to participating Oil Companies, a condensed version is available in book format through DNV Norway. It is important to note that there are four editions of these books, and newer editions may not include the same data as older ones. Be sure to verify which book or books contain the specific data you need. Please be aware that these books come at a cost of approximately $200 each.</p>

            <p>Looking for reliable offshore reliability data? Check out the "Offshore Reliability Data Handbook" 4th Edition, (OREDA 2002) as recommended by Vee. This comprehensive handbook can be purchased for NOK 4,250, which is approximately Eur 545 or USD 680 including shipping/handling charges. For more information, visit http://www.sintef.no/static/tl/projects/oreda/handbook.html.

            <p>Unfortunately, obtaining specialized information on reliability, maintainability, and risk can be challenging as it is typically only available from manufacturers and private databases, which can be costly. While some books on reliability may include data in their appendices, the information is often limited. One recommended book that stands out in this area is "Reliability Maintainability and Risk" by Dr. David J. Smith, published by BH (Butterworth & Heinemann) in its sixth edition in 2001. To find more comprehensive information, consider checking out this book at a library or bookshop. Good luck in your search for information on reliability! Best regards, Rui.</p>

            <p>For student research purposes, universities should allocate a budget sourced from student fees to ensure access to essential reference materials. Additionally, consider exploring potential interchange programs with institutions like Imperial College to expand resources. It has been reported that engineers and similar professions spend a significant portion of their time searching for information. It is essential to overcome this hurdle by leveraging available resources. Reach out to your librarian or professor for further guidance.</p>

            <p>I invested in the Faradip.three database mentioned by Rui, which has been a valuable tool for cross-referencing our data. We purchased it for approximately $700 US, and it has helped improve the reliability of our shaky data. The database contains similar information to "Reliability Maintainability and Risk". In my opinion, it is worth purchasing the book as well.</p>
