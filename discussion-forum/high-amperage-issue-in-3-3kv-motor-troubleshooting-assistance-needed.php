                    <p>Greetings, our workshop recently received a motor from our plant with the following specifications: Voltage: 3.3 kV Power: 300 kW No load current: 25A Full load current: 68 A Solo run (no load) current: 33.4A Brand: ABB RPM : 989 RPM The issue at hand is that the current during the solo run exceeds the permissible value by 48%, which should ideally be 20% of the full load current (63A), equating to 33.4A. Despite conducting a successful megger test with a 5kV test voltage (resulting in over 100 MegaOhm), performing maintenance tasks such as cleaning the stator, rotor balancing, bearing replacement, and metal spraying did not resolve the issue.

            <p>Pisemude: High current under no-load conditions (assuming the motor is not coupled) can be attributed to various factors. While you have addressed many of these factors, there are additional areas that should be examined to assess the situation. Firstly, consider if the motor has undergone rewinding in the past as changes to the windings may lead to high current due to a subpar repair job. Additionally, a damaged core can also result in elevated no-load current as it affects circuit impedance and motor losses. 

To further troubleshoot the issue, ensure that the motor is operating at the specified nameplate voltage. Any deviation from this voltage can cause an increase in no-load current, with noticeable changes starting at around 3% above or below the nameplate value. Voltage imbalances between phases can also contribute to this issue. Rotor malfunctions can lead to reduced torque and subsequent high current under no-load conditions. Various methods such as growler testing, single phasing, infrared testing, vibration analysis, and dye testing can be employed to evaluate the rotor's condition during repair processes. 

With advancements in technology, motor circuit analysis and current signature analysis have become more accurate in detecting rotor bar issues. Growler testing, for example, involves inducing power into the rotor while using metal filings or magnetic paper to inspect rotor bars. Single phase testing, infrared testing, and vibration analysis are other effective methods to detect rotor faults. Analog current meters and inductance testing can also be utilized for diagnosis purposes. Current signature analysis remains a reliable technique for identifying severe rotor bar conditions.</p>

            <p>Valuable insights from Howard. One point of contention is the idea that low voltage can lead to high current during no-load operation. In reality, reducing voltage will always result in decreased current in such situations. It is crucial to ensure that the voltage does not exceed the nameplate rating by more than 10%. Additionally, it is important to verify balanced currents, as any imbalance could be linked to power system voltages or the motor itself. It is worth considering if a wye motor has been incorrectly connected in delta, as this could significantly increase current. While a no-load current of 33A~ 50% FLA may seem high for a 4-pole motor, the criteria of 20% FLA appears overly strict. The source of the listed "No load current: 25A" is unclear and seems to surpass the 20% threshold you mentioned.</p>

            <p>The relationship between voltage and current in an electric motor is complex, with various factors influencing the results. Higher voltages can lead to increased current due to excitation of the stator and rotor cores, as well as circuit impedance. On the other hand, lower voltages may cause the motor to generate a weaker magnetic field, resulting in more slip and increased losses.

During motor starting, there is a significant spike in current, sometimes reaching up to 21 times the nameplate current. This is known as the 'half-cycle peak.' The initial high current is a result of the locked rotor condition, with both the stator and rotor experiencing full line frequency.

As the motor reaches higher loads, losses play a smaller role, while at lower loads, losses become more significant. This is reflected in a standard NEMA chart showing higher running currents at lower than nameplate voltages.

Issues such as broken or damaged rotor bars can also lead to higher currents, as the motor struggles to generate enough torque, causing increased slip frequency and pulsating current.

The question of where a specific idle current value of 25 Amps comes from is raised, noting that different motor types may have varying idle currents. Rule of thumb estimations are common, but it is important to consider the specific characteristics of the motor in question. In the USA, similar 6-pole machines often have idle currents around half or just over half of the full load current.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>A decrease in voltage results in a decrease in no-load current. This is due to the fact that, in equivalent circuit terms, as we approach a no-load condition where the synchronous reactance (s) approaches zero, the rotor branch R2/S essentially disappears (as if it were an open circuit). At this point, only the stator leakage reactance and magnetizing reactance remain, creating a constant impedance below saturation levels. Therefore, reducing the voltage across this constant impedance will lead to a decrease in current flow.</p>

            <p>When considering motor performance, it is important to note that assuming the voltage is at the nameplate value may not always be accurate. The S~0 method of conducting a no-load test suggests that the motor will operate at synchronous speed even at lower voltages. This method simplifies calculations for comparing with blocked-rotor tests and estimating performance. For smaller motors with light rotors, such as integral or fractional horsepower motors, this assumption holds true until the voltage decreases significantly. However, larger motors may exhibit different dynamics. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the actual idle current to accurately assess motor performance.</p>

            <p>When the voltage drops below the nameplate rating by a factor of 2 or more, the current will initially decrease. However, if the voltage continues to decrease further, factors such as friction and windage can cause the current to increase once again. It is possible that the current mentioned in the original post is not abnormal. It is important to note that the 20% full load amperage (FLA) figure cited is not realistic for a 6-pole motor.</p>

            <p>Dear Mr. Howard, The 25A current is sourced from the name plate, with a 50Hz frequency supply. The issue has been resolved, as it was caused by an unbalanced supply from the main feeder. Our panel testing did not show any high current readings. Many thanks to both Mr. Howard and electricpete for your valuable assistance and information.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I am pleased to hear that your issue has been resolved. In terms of curiosity, I am interested in exploring how much voltage would need to decrease in order to observe an increase in current above the normal full-voltage no-load current for a typical motor. Losses typically account for less than 5% of output power, with friction and windage making up 10% of those losses. This means that friction/windage is less than 0.5% of output power. Theoretically, it should be possible to reduce voltage by a factor of 10, resulting in a torque reduction of 100, while still being able to accelerate the motor easily.

It is important to note that the load component of the current is likely to be higher than the friction load, by a factor of the voltage ratio (10). This would mean that the load component of the current is 5% of full load current. Taking into consideration that the magnetizing current has decreased by a factor of 10 to a maximum of 5% current, the total current would be the sum of the load component and the magnetizing component, resulting in a total of 10% current.

Based on these calculations, it appears that voltage would need to be decreased by more than a factor of 10 below the nameplate before seeing an increase in current above the full-voltage no-load current. Exploring further, if voltage were decreased by a factor of 30, the current would not exceed the locked rotor current over voltage ratio, which is around 17%, still lower than the full-voltage no-load current.

Therefore, the range of voltage reduction that could potentially increase the no-load current would fall somewhere between 10x and 30x below the nameplate voltage. If the voltage falls outside of this range on either side (but remains below the nameplate voltage), the current would still decrease.</p>
