            <p>As I approach the twilight of my career, I have gained valuable insights that I would like to share. It is crucial to understand that Maintenance involves managing Residual Risks, as there is no room for a Risk Appetite in this field. Disregarding this can lead to severe consequences. Asset Management encompasses the entire lifecycle of assets, requiring each asset to be meticulously data mapped to its Parent/Child relationship and System. Identifying the steward of each asset is essential. Following the manufacturer's guidelines for equipment maintenance may seem trivial, but it could be the key to protecting yourself legally in case of a mishap. Building a strong relationship with the finance department enables you to have a say in the fixed asset register valuation and familiarize yourself with Activity Based Accounting. Best of luck on your journey! ------------------------------ Mark Tripet Strategic Asset Manager ------------------------------ 
Rephrased Message: 
Recent advancements in my career have equipped me with valuable insights that I wish to impart. Recognizing that Maintenance involves managing Residual Risks, rather than having a Risk Appetite, is crucial to avoid legal repercussions. Asset Management encompasses the entire lifespan of assets, requiring accurate data mapping for effective management. Understanding the manufacturer's recommended equipment maintenance guidelines can potentially safeguard you in case of legal disputes. Establishing a collaborative relationship with the finance department will allow you to influence fixed asset register valuation and comprehend Activity Based Accounting. Best wishes on your endeavor! ------------------------------ Mark Tripet Strategic Asset Manager ------------------------------</p>

            <p>Congratulations on your new role! With over 30 years of experience in maintenance, I am currently collaborating with an AI/ML company specializing in asset management and maintenance operations. Data consistency and quality play a crucial role in driving best practices and future AI/ML initiatives. I recommend conducting a comprehensive data gap audit on your existing Asset and Work Management data. This audit will assess the quality of your data, identify areas for improvement, and pinpoint gaps that need to be addressed to enhance your asset management and maintenance decisions. It is essential to differentiate between a true data gap analysis and a data process gap analysis to ensure accurate insights. While many consulting companies offer data process gap analyses, a true data gap analysis related to asset management and maintenance operations is still uncommon. As maintenance organizations transition to AI/ML software, understanding the importance of a thorough data gap analysis will be paramount.

            <p>After reviewing your question and the responses from your colleagues, congratulations on your new role as the lead of Maintenance and Asset Management. It is important to clarify that Maintenance Management and Asset Management are not the same. To kick off your new position, consider conducting an Initial Assessment or Gap Analysis to align with industry standards and best practices.

Asset Care Management involves adopting various standards, including ISOs 55000, 9001, 14000, 50001, 37000, 45001, 31000, and 14224. These standards provide a comprehensive framework to meet your company's needs. Implementing these standards, along with methodologies like RCM and TPM, can help identify business risks, optimize maintenance activities, and improve asset performance.

While TPM may not need to be fully adopted, integrating its principles can enhance your maintenance strategies. Creating an integrated plan for this process is essential for success. Collaborating with different functional areas and leveraging techniques like RCM and TPM can lead to a more efficient and effective approach to Maintenance and Asset Management.

In conclusion, starting with an Initial Assessment and incorporating industry standards and proven methodologies will set you on the right path towards developing successful Asset Maintenance and Asset Management practices. Good luck on your journey to optimizing maintenance and asset performance in your new role!</p>

            <p>Congratulations on your new role! Having retired in 2020 after over four decades in the industrial gases sector, particularly in reliability management for production facilities globally, I understand the challenges you may face. One crucial starting point I recommend is determining the real cost of downtime for your operations. As you introduce new programs and technologies to enhance reliability, securing funding from executive management will require showcasing return on investment (ROI) metrics. To accurately calculate ROI, understanding the impact of downtime is essential. Without knowing the cost implications of reducing reliability from 98% to 96%, you may struggle to make a compelling case. In the business realm, everything should contribute to margin performance, with maintenance seen as a fixed rather than variable cost. At IMC2021, I presented "Selling Reliability ROI & ROC," a session that could offer valuable insights. Be cautious of internally-developed CMMS programs, as they often lack financial integration - financial implications should underpin all decision-making to align with business goals and maintain reliability for meeting customer and investor expectations.

            <p>Are you clear on your areas of responsibility? When it comes to Asset management, are you responsible for storeroom/inventory management, or just asset operations? Is your role primarily data-driven, such as a CMMS administrator or scheduler? Conducting a gap analysis is a beneficial starting point, unless the current system is too complex to navigate efficiently. Familiarizing yourself with the department's workflow can help in conducting a basic inventory assessment, including how work orders are processed, parts procurement, and shift scheduling. Once you understand the current situation, you can identify areas that need improvement. These are just some initial recommendations to help you kickstart your role as the lead for maintenance and asset management. For more insights, feel free to reach out.

Subject: Where do I start?

I have recently taken a position within my company as the lead for maintenance and asset management. I want to get off to a good start and was thinking the best place to start would be to do a gap analysis and inventory of our systems. We have a home-grown Asset and Work Management system, and I know some data fields are present, but I am seeking suggestions on how to determine what new data fields should be added to develop Asset Management and Asset Maintenance practices and plans.</p>

            <p>What is the detrimental cycle of reactive maintenance, known as "The Vicious Cycle"? This cycle involves constantly fixing equipment breakdowns after they have already occurred, resulting in higher costs and increased workload for maintenance teams. This leads to temporary repairs that ultimately cause more re-work and a heavier maintenance burden. As costs rise, pressure builds on budgets and head count, leading to cuts that further strain the maintenance team. With fewer resources and more work, the backlog grows, work standards drop, and morale decreases. Missed preventive maintenance tasks then lead to more breakdowns, restarting the reactive cycle. To break free from this cycle, two key steps are crucial: prioritizing work through planning and scheduling using methods like the Ranking Index for Maintenance Expenditure (RIME) and Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM), and eliminating repeat failures through defect elimination. Optimizing your preventive maintenance program is also essential. This approach can help you escape the destructive cycle and avoid unnecessary stress and anxiety.</p>

            <p>Congratulations on your new role! The insights shared here are invaluable, and I highly recommend point 1 made by @Mark Tripet - in an ideal scenario, nothing would malfunction, but unfortunately, breakdowns are inevitable. Therefore, maintenance is crucial to minimize risks. Another important aspect to consider is that everything starts at the ground level: assets are meant to function. If you are new to the role, take advantage of the opportunity to visit the plant and implement some quick improvements before getting caught up in meetings. While systems are essential for support, remember to prioritize the assets themselves.
