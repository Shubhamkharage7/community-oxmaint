                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I need assistance with repairing a piece of ground service equipment at Van Nuys Airport. I hope this request aligns with forum guidelines, as I have seen a similar inquiry regarding DC motor windings. The issue at hand involves an electric aircraft tug previously manufactured by JetPorter, which is now under the ownership of Tronair. Unfortunately, the technical data from the original manufacturer has been lost. The equipment operates on a hydraulic system with a pump and a pump controller that were replaced by a previous mechanic, resulting in the pump malfunctioning. The Curtis-made pump controller has 4 terminals (B+, B-, M-, & A2) for power distribution, while the motor has 2 terminals (T1 marked D1E1 and T2 marked A2E2). It is evident that the current motor is not suitable for the 72-volt system as it is labeled for 48 volts. Before acquiring a new motor, it is crucial to determine the correct winding configuration. It is assumed the new motor should be a 3-wire, unidirectional motor wired to B+, M-, and A2 on the speed controller outputs. When connected to B+ and A2, the speed controller does not activate the motor but does provide 59 volts to open the ground path on M-. Any guidance on the proper winding for this motor would be greatly appreciated, as the equipment's functionality is vital for airport operations. Thank you in advance for any assistance provided.</p>

            <p>The electrohydraulic transmission system may rely on the hydraulic component for speed regulation, while the electric motor operates at a consistent pace. In this case, only 2 wires may be necessary for operation. Are there any comparable systems in the vicinity that we can observe to better understand its functionality?</p>

            <p>If you're looking to set up a speed controller for a permanent magnet motor using armature wire, seek advice from golf cart repair forums. These forums hold a wealth of information on DC motors and controllers, with enthusiasts sharing their insights on making or modifying speed controllers and motors. In the industrial sector, DC motors were phased out in favor of VFDs due to their cost-effectiveness. Explore these forums to tap into the tribal knowledge for similar projects.</p>

            <p>Are you looking for assistance with a custom motor drive system? Most equipment typically runs on 48v, but custom systems can use different voltages. Hydraulic pumps typically operate at a fixed speed, while DC motors have various lead configurations. Armature (A1/A2), field (F1/F2), and series field (S1/S2) connections determine motor power. Varying field current controls speed, and changing polarity controls direction. If you're uncertain about your motor system, consider replacing both the motor and drive with more standard options. Figuring out a custom system without documentation may be challenging, but using an ohm meter to test the windings could provide insight.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, I appreciate it. Tronair has acquired the company that created the electric tug JetPorter, and there seems to be limited information available on the 72-volt system. They now offer a comparable 48-volt unit, which was sold to a previous mechanic who was unable to get it running. The mechanic also purchased a 1204m speed controller, for which I have attached literature and pictures of my DC motor terminals. The equipment is a combination of parts from two different machines since the 72-volt system is no longer in production and lacks technical support. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>I am unable to find a way to operate a two-terminal brushed permanent magnet motor. It is clear that the motor has only two terminals and operates in one direction, spinning as expected at different speeds when connected to various voltages such as 12, 36, and 72 volts. While it may potentially spin in the opposite direction with reversed polarity, this is not essential for its operation. This motor is likely designed for use with a pressurized accumulator. I understand the wiring configuration for a golf cart sepex with four wires, but I believe this motor specifically requires a sepex motor controller.</p>

            <p>In regard to the electrohydraulic transmission, it is possible that the hydraulic component controls speed while the electric motor maintains a constant speed, requiring only two wires. Have you observed a similar system in operation nearby? The transmission consists of two 72-volt motors directly powering the wheels, operating independently with the exception of hydraulic braking when the foot pedal is released. The aftermarket parts displayed were installed by a previous mechanic who is no longer with the company, leaving behind a custom setup that requires further customization. I am in the process of managing the components from various manufacturers that were purchased by the company. Thank you.</p>

            <p>The Plug Diode plays a crucial role in the operation of a motor, acting as a brake when reducing speed or coming to a stop. In braking mode, the motor transforms into a generator with reverse polarity, allowing the braking energy to be directed back to the battery for regeneration. The attached documents demonstrate the process of reversing the motor by altering the polarity of the field. It is worth noting that smaller motors may not have a shunt field, eliminating the need for S1 and S2 connections. It is important to always consider the current flow and polarity, as the current flow is reversed during braking. Moreover, it is essential to never run a DC motor without an armature load and field current, as this can lead to motor speed limitations or even explosion. These precautions are crucial for proper variable speed control using DC motors.</p>
