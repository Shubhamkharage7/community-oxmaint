                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am seeking advice regarding a recurring issue we are facing in our system. Despite cleaning out our Call Horizons, Scheduling Period, and other relevant Scheduling parameters, we are still experiencing a problem with a work order's Latest Allowable Finish Date defaulting to the same call date. This is perplexing as our system has been set up to allow some flexibility in the planned end date. I am curious if this issue could be related to any backlogs of planned dates in the system that have not been called yet, even though our next calls are not necessarily dependent on previous confirmations. Our shift factors are straightforward. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Chigozie.</p>

            <p>Delving too deep into programming intricacies without a solid grasp of planning and scheduling could lead to complications. Understand the fundamentals of planning and scheduling before getting too involved in programming details to avoid any potential issues.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Are you properly setting up the system to account for some flexibility in the scheduled end date? It seems like there may be some confusion regarding how the scheduling parameters impact future plan due dates in SAP. These parameters dictate how SAP adjusts the next plan due date based on whether the previous call was completed before or after the due date, factoring in any specified tolerances. It's important to note that these parameters do not establish a range of allowable start and finish dates for the current call.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Thank you, Josh and David, for your feedback. As I mentioned earlier, our systems are set up to calculate LAFDs based on compliance categories at the task list, taking into account tolerances deducted from Maintenance Frequencies. This works well for the majority of our work activities, with Maintenance Planning and Scheduling functioning smoothly. However, there are occasional workorders that are generated solely based on LAFDs during auto deadline monitoring. I'm curious if others have experienced this issue, as it seems to be specific to our SAP system and not a common problem.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Diagnosing issues remotely can be challenging. However, if the problem only occurs with a few orders, it's important to pinpoint what sets them apart from other orders that are processed correctly. Consider whether these orders follow a common strategy and if they meet the selection criteria for regular deadline monitoring, or if they are only included in a batch process. Additionally, clarification is needed on what is meant by compliance categories in a task list and how they are configured within your company.

It's worth noting that Normal Early Start and Early Finish tolerances in a maintenance plan are calculated based on the shortest package in a strategy, which may differ from individual maintenance tasks. This discrepancy can often lead to confusion among users.</p>

            <p>Hello David, our Maintenance Plans vary from Single Cycle to Strategy Plans based on Time & Performance. This issue is present in both types of plans, although it is not widespread. I may not have all the information about how our IMG system works in relation to your specific inquiries, but this issue seems to be present in various settings. I will take some time to investigate further and hopefully pinpoint a pattern. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.</p>
