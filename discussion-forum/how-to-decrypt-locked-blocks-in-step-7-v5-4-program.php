            <p>It appears that these blocks have been encrypted using Block Privacy instead of Know_How_Protect. Without the password, it is unlikely that you will be able to decrypt them. It is also possible that the manufacturer did not choose the decompilation option during encryption. For more information on Block Privacy, please visit this link.</p>

Without the password, it's unlikely that you'll be able to decrypt them. It's also possible that the manufacturer didn't choose the decompilation option when encrypting. Check out this lnkBlock Privacy for more information. Thank you to slp530 for pointing this out. The block property indicates that decryption is possible. Attached is a screenshot for reference.</p>
