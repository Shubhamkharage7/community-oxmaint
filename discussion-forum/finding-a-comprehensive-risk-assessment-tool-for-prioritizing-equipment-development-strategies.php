            <p>Attached is a helpful spreadsheet that can assist in filtering equipment based on failure consequence. By combining historical costs and losses, one can identify which equipment should be a top priority for further analysis using RCM/FMECA. When it comes to spare parts, it is important to first determine which equipment has the highest consequences of failure or is the most probable based on historical data. Next, analyze this equipment using an RCM process to develop a maintenance strategy. This strategy will then guide decisions on spare parts, such as in the case of implementing condition-based monitoring. For more information on improving reliability, check out the first three posts in the "Reliability and Availability Levers" section under the "Posts about Improving Reliability" forum. Download the attached spreadsheet for more details.</p>

            <p>In 1994, I learned from one of the original creators that MPDS software, originally developed by BHP Engineering, was influenced by Tony Kelly's "Strategy Based Maintenance." It is still widely used by various BHP companies and numerous consultants who were involved in its development. Many maintenance engineers in Australia have experience with MPDS, which has now evolved into RCMTurbo. Following BHP Engineering's acquisition by Hatch Engineering, MPDS and other products were acquired by Strategic and rebranded. Other products from that era, such as "Lumpies" (now known as "Ca$H") and "SCAS" (spares criticality and assessment system), were also part of this transition.</p>

            <p>Dear kencj, I would advise against starting your analysis with a criticality type of approach, such as Fuzzy logic matrices or other quantifiable criticality matrices. It is essential to understand how a system can fail and the impact of each failure mode before determining its criticality. Thus, it is recommended to prioritize a prioritization approach over a criticality approach. One effective multi-criteria decision-making methodology to consider is the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). AHP is known for its speed and reliability in aligning with corporate objectives. Implementing AHP can help you identify the assets with the greatest impact, as agreed upon by company decision-makers, and guide your analytical work efficiently. Rather than getting bogged down in defining functions, failures, and quantifying impacts right from the start, focusing on prioritization can accelerate your analysis process. As you progress through your reliability analyses, you can gradually assess the criticality levels. In my personal opinion, this post is relevant to these threads. Best regards,</p>

            <p>Daryl, I concur with the feedback regarding criticality and prioritization methods. In my view, all equipment's importance is relative, with no absolutes. Thus, it is crucial to categorize equipment to effectively manage the site. Combining everything in one category does not lead to progress. Do you believe there are no shortcuts in this process? Is performing a full FMECA or RCM analysis on all equipment mandatory? I suggest that companies start with the most critical equipment due to resource constraints. While this approach may pose initial risks, it should not be the endpoint. The program should evolve, with more equipment analyzed each year, based on each company's capabilities. If funding limits a company to a partial analysis, is this better than none at all? Should a company prioritize historical cost or use filters to assess consequences? Or is it wiser to conduct a complete RCM analysis on a specific plant section? Ultimately, the answer depends on individual perspectives, opinions, and past experiences. Additionally, a company's change management and sustainability processes will impact the overall value gained from these analyses.</p>

            <p>Hello Jaz, I want to clarify my previous point. While I believe Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is crucial, it may not be applicable to every situation. Therefore, some level of targeted effort is necessary. This is not a shortcut, but a practical approach. Instead of ranking equipment based on criticality, it may be more beneficial to prioritize based on their alignment with current corporate objectives. To learn more about prioritization techniques like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), you can visit the following links: [ExpertChoice AHP software](http://www.expertchoice.com/customerservice/ahp.htm) or [Wikipedia page on AHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_Hierarchy_Process). In summary, the AHP process involves listing corporate objectives, having decision makers rank them, analyzing their responses for consistency, and aligning project benefits with these objectives to determine their priority. This method has proven effective, particularly in industries like nuclear where court support has been obtained. Typically, focusing on 20% of assets can yield 60%-80% of benefits, while the next 30% may provide 10-15% more. This concept aligns with the Pareto Principle. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Thank you, Daryl, for your response. I want to clarify that my "clunky" filter is aligned with the company's goals, although this might not have been clear initially. I haven't disclosed all the key criteria specific to my workplace, but for some, health, safety, and environmental priorities can be prioritized based on importance and the situations to avoid. There are additional scoring criteria that I haven't shared, which are set by decision makers to achieve corporate objectives. However, my filter does not incorporate Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). In marketing, the AHP method is used by automobile manufacturers to determine consumer priorities such as power, fuel efficiency, cargo volume, and occupancy. These criteria are compared and scored relative to each other to identify the most crucial qualities to focus on. These priorities may change due to external factors like high oil prices or shifting demographics. Maintaining "orthogonality" in criteria, as highlighted in the Wikipedia article, is essential. I hadn't considered using this approach to select equipment for analysis, which is thought-provoking. In a previous discussion, you mentioned that this may not align with your approach – could you provide further explanation on this?</p>

            <p>Hello Jaz, When I say "not my system," I mean that I did not create it but rather implement it. This approach has been instrumental in organizing RCM analyses, prioritizing capital spending portfolios worth up to half a billion pounds, and evaluating strategic initiatives within asset transformation programs. Once I grasped the system's mechanisms and benefits, I discovered numerous opportunities to utilize it effectively. Moreover, it fosters engagement from senior management in daily reliability operations within the plant, organization, or institute. Warm regards,</p>

            <p>The AHP method is a valuable tool, but it's crucial to remember that timing plays a significant role in the success of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) initiatives. When deciding which assets to prioritize for RCM, consider what matters most to stakeholders at the time. The assets chosen for the initial RCM assessments do not have to align with quantitative rankings of priority or criticality. Implementing RCM successfully involves a cultural shift, and it's important to engage key management personnel early on. Identify assets that impact both safety and operations to gain buy-in from all involved parties. Clearly communicate the benefits of RCM to stakeholders and involve an experienced consultant for the first project. To maximize the impact of RCM, encourage a shift in mindset within the organization by focusing on early successes on highly visible equipment. This approach will set the stage for a systematic analysis and ranking of assets for future RCM initiatives.</p>

            <p>I incorporate Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) into my management consulting services. Additionally, I utilize fuzzy logic criticality analysis, depending on the specific scenario. While some may have questioned the distinction between the two methods in the past, I firmly believe that the variance is significant and impactful. A few examples of projects where I have successfully implemented AHP include capital planning, operational expenditure planning, RCM analysis prioritization, and allocation of improvement funds. Once the concept "clicked" for me, the potential applications of this method seemed endless. Regards,</p>
