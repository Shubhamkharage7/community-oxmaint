                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Last night, the large grinder experienced an electrical issue just as I was getting ready to leave, following an 11-hour work day. I am seeking advice on potential root causes and preventive measures for the problem. Despite the upcoming installation of new knives and a screen from the supplier, the grinder is currently not running smoothly, resulting in plastic entering the bearings and causing significant stress during startup. Interestingly, the 100HP AC induction motor's starter, which is relatively new and appears to be in good condition, is showing signs of sluggishness. To remedy the situation, I have found that turning the disconnect off and on, followed by the third or fourth push of the start button, allows the contactor to close and the motor to operate properly, as long as the start button is held down for a few seconds. Otherwise, the motor starts and stops abruptly, indicating a possible issue with the auxiliaries. While all buttons and contactors seem to be in good condition (aside from one e-stop, which I replaced the contacts for), I am curious if others have encountered similar behavior. I have not yet disassembled the starter, as I needed to leave for the day, but plan to address it on Monday morning.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I came across a similar issue at a manufacturing facility previously. The frequent activation and transition of equipment may contribute to this recurrent problem with the starter. What exactly is an e-stop? Could it be referring to an emergency stop function?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>An e-stop, also known as an emergency stop palm button, is designed to remain engaged once pressed until intentionally released. This type of button is crucial in emergency situations where machinery or equipment needs to be immediately halted for safety reasons.</p>
