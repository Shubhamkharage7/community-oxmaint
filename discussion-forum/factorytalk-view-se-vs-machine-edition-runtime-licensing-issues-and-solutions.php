                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently facing challenges while trying to run a Machine Edition Runtime (.mer) on a server. Despite activating Factorytalk View SE, which my distributor insisted was the correct version, Rockwell has pointed out that the issues may be due to my serial number being registered to the distributor. Strangely, my Studio license has been functioning smoothly without any issues. I suspect that the distributor may have provided the wrong version, as indicated by the error message I have encountered. I have explored various options within the Studio software to resolve the issue, but to no avail. The pressure is on as I have a deadline to meet and key stakeholders, including the CEO and contractor, are expecting results. Could it be a case of the distributor delaying in order to make a second sale or am I missing something obvious? Additionally, I have included a direct link to the image to provide more context: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q415mn9zj8hqwj1/liscence.png</p>

            <p>The MER file is specifically designed for FT View ME, rather than FT View SE. To operate this file on a PC, a valid FT View ME Station license is required. The license is based on the number of displays within the project, with the minimum starting at 15 displays. The size of the license needed will be determined by the total number of displays in use.</p>

            <p>Your image reveals everything. You possess a license for FT View SE Station, not ME, so that option is not viable. ME is typically utilized on a PC rather than a server. Compatibility hinges on the ME version, server OS version, and whether it is 32 or 64 bit. If I were in your shoes and had an existing ME project, I would recommend converting it to SE and utilizing the SE station license at your disposal. Why are you interested in running ME on a server? It appears to be excessive.</p>

            <p>The Plc Kid pointed out that a FT View SE Station license is required instead of an ME license for the project to work properly. ME is typically used on a PC rather than a server, but compatibility depends on the ME version, server OS version, and whether it is 32 or 64 bit. It is recommended to convert an existing ME project to SE and utilize the SE station license available. Running ME on a server may be unnecessary and excessive. Ensure you have SE Studio, as ME Studio alone will not allow conversion to SE.</p>

            <p>Baldone emphasized the importance of having SE Studio over ME Studio for compatibility with SE conversion. When looking into the thread, it became clear that the initial software package provided did not include SE, resembling the frustration experienced with the Chinese version. Despite now having the SE version installed, issues arose such as losing alarms, macros converting to text files, difficulties accessing global connection settings for macros, and activating the email activex control tag. There is a desire to have stuck with the ME server, allowing employees to log in remotely over a VLAN as they currently do.</p>

With your guidance, our project successfully overcame its initial obstacle, and we are now monitoring our first two sites! This weekend, I am focused on mastering the process of triggering emails. Previously, I would trigger emails using a global macro and send alarms to a tag in machine edition. Now, I need to figure out how to accomplish this task. I appreciate that setting up alarms is much simpler in Site Edition. So far, I have not had to write any if-then-else expressions to compare my tank levels.</p>

            <p>According to brendan.buchan, the .MER file is specific to FT View ME and not compatible with FT View SE. To run the file on a PC, a FT View ME Station license is necessary, which is determined by the number of displays in the project. Licensing typically starts at 15 displays. An inquiry was also made about whether FT View ME is needed to load the .MER file onto the HMI, with a mention of potentially using a USB drive instead. This is an older issue that needs clarification.</p>

            <p>In a forum thread, kbelyeu asked about loading .MER files onto an HMI without the need for FT View ME software. While it is possible to use a USB drive for this task, a more convenient option is to utilize the ME Transfer Utility. This utility allows users to transfer and load files directly onto the HMI from a laptop via Ethernet. You can easily download this utility for free. Alternatively, you can follow a guide on transferring .MER files to the HMI using a USB drive or memory card for PanelView Plus models. Learn step-by-step instructions on how to do this in our detailed article on The Automation Blog.</p>

            <p>In response to Brendan.buchan's query, Kurt is advised that there is no need for FT View ME to load the .MER onto the HMI. It can be done through USB or by using the ME Transfer Utility, which simplifies the process of transferring and loading files directly onto the HMI from a laptop. By knowing the IP address of the HMI, transferring files over Ethernet becomes even more convenient. The free ME Transfer Utility can be easily downloaded. Users can also refer to a guide for loading files via USB in the PanelView Plus – .MER Runtime: Transfer To Terminal using Memory Card article on The Automation Blog website. Inquiring further, Kurt questions the benefits of having a licensed copy of FT View ME. Wondering if it is worth the investment, Kurt seeks advice on whether getting a copy is advisable beyond just fulfilling a sales initiative.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the benefits of owning a licensed copy of FT View ME can be quite beneficial. While it may seem like a sales tactic from the sales team, having a copy can actually come in handy. Having FT View ME is particularly useful if you plan on modifying the existing HMI program or updating firmware versions of the .MER runtime. However, if your goal is simply to backup/restore the .MER file to the same PanelView Plus HMI's, then FT View ME may not be necessary. It's worth noting that HMI's usually support backward compatibility in terms of firmware versions. For example, if your .MER file is on firmware V6, a HMI with firmware V9 should still be able to run it smoothly. So, investing in FT View ME may depend on your specific needs and requirements.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In order to make changes to your existing HMI program or update firmware versions of the .MER runtime file, you may need FT View MT. However, if you simply want to backup/restore the .MER file for PanelView Plus HMI's of the same type, FT View MT may not be necessary but it's always good to have on hand. PanelView Plus HMI's are typically backwards compatible with different firmware versions, so even if your .MER file is on firmware V6, it should still run on a later firmware version like V9. Your assistance has been greatly appreciated, and I owe you a pint if our paths ever cross! -Kurt</p>
