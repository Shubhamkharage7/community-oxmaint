                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>For efficient remote access to my projects outside of my home, I decided to utilize Weintek's solutions after conducting thorough research. I successfully set up my first Weintek touch screen yesterday, along with a domain on WeinCloud for a secure VPN connection. The setup also included a remote access card purchased for around $90 AUD. By configuring the screen with the appropriate IP addresses and connecting it to a modem with a data-only SIM card, I was able to seamlessly access the screen using EasyAccess software and Weintek CMT viewer. Additionally, I connected my PLC to the touch screen's second Ethernet port and my laptop to the PLC via a switch, enabling online access to the PLC. The process involved setting up a cloud connection and adding the PLC's IP address. I was impressed by the ease of the setup compared to older methods involving expensive equipment and complicated configurations. Weintek screens offer good graphics and compatibility with various PLC brands, making it a cost-effective solution for remote access. I look forward to exploring additional features such as email notifications and push messages to mobile devices through WeinCloud. My customers will also benefit from accessing the screen using the EasyAccess app on their mobile phones and computers. Next week, I plan to set up another system and provide detailed instructions for my colleagues. While Red Lion offers a similar solution, I found Weintek to be more affordable and feature-rich. They even offer specialized solutions for CODESYS and Siemens PLCs, although my experience is limited to Omron PLCs. Overall, setting up remote access with Weintek was straightforward, with the only additional requirement being a DNS server such as Google's default DNS 8.8.8.8.</p>

            <p>Hello Bob, welcome to the other side! I have been selling these products for quite some time now. I currently only offer one model, which is not only affordable but also highly effective. This model caters to a wide range of drivers, making it suitable for everyone. It is also available for private labeling by several manufacturers. According to feedback I've received, many customers prefer the Maple model manufactured by Weintek because of their exceptional customer support. Additionally, there are rumors that they are working on integrating Arduino technology into their HMI, which would be a great feature to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Thank you GT! I am currently looking to find maple products in Oz, but have not had much luck. The local distributor offers a variety of sizes, including 10", 12", and 15". Initially, I encountered some difficulties with support, but was able to resolve them. A friend suggested checking out YouTube for more information, which was somewhat helpful.</p>

            <p>I have been utilizing them for a significant period of time. The quality of the graphics is impressive, and the drivers are a major advantage. Setting up Modbus for CoDeSys (especially with Wago products) is straightforward. Additionally, they provide their own CoDeSys I/O solutions, but it's important to choose the right unit for your needs. I have even used their products for replacing old SLC systems with both serial and Ethernet connections, outperforming PV options. Furthermore, Maple offers excellent customer support if you ever require assistance. Both Weintek and Maple have their own dedicated YouTube channels where you can find comprehensive guides and tutorials for configuring a unit effectively.</p>
