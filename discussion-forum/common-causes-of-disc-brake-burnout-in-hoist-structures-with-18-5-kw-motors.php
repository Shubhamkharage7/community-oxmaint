                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, 

We have hoist structures in our PTMS that are supported by powerful 18.5 kW motors. These motors are equipped with an electromagnetic disc brake that is activated by a BME 1.5 rectifier. Recently, we encountered a problem where the disc coils were burned, and we are struggling to identify the root cause of this issue. The brake rectifier is connected directly to a 3*400V line through a circuit breaker rated at 3.5-5A, as well as a contactor that triggers its activation.

We are curious about the potential reasons behind a disc brake burning out in this scenario. Our motor operations are overseen by a VFC, with brake activation controlled by a PLC.

Thank you for your valuable insights and time.</p>

            <p>Alij mentioned an issue with hoist structures in their PTMs supported by Sew 18.5 kW motors. These motors come equipped with an electromagnetic disc brake activated by a BME1.5 rectifier. After experiencing burnt disc coils, the cause of the problem remains elusive. The brake rectifier is linked directly to a 3*400V line through a 3.5-5A circuit breaker and a activating contactor. What factors could be contributing to disc brake burnout? The motors are controlled by a VFC, with brake activation managed by a PLC. It is crucial to consistently monitor the air gap, as wear on the brake disc can lead to increased air gap that requires adjustment. When replacing a burnt coil, consider replacing the rectifier as well. By adhering to proper maintenance practices for brake motors, instances of failure have significantly decreased.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Have you confirmed that the coil is specifically designed for direct current rather than alternating current? Connecting an AC coil to DC power can lead to serious damage. It seems unusual to have a brake connected to 400V DC.</p>

                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>05-11-2024</span></li>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure optimal performance and safety, it is essential for the power to the brake coil to be DC. It appears that a 3-phase full-wave rectifier is used to power the brake coil, with most brake modules automatically reducing power to prevent coil overheating. It is important to avoid applying 3-phase or any AC power to the brake coil to prevent damage and ensure proper functioning.

Regular inspection of the brake system is crucial to ensure the brakes are still effective in holding the load when the power is off. It is recommended to check if the disk can fully retract to prevent coil overheating. Make sure that the brake coil is energized to release the brake, as the spring should engage the brake when the power is off. Proper maintenance and inspection of the brake system can prevent potential issues and ensure smooth operation.

In my experience designing and building crane systems, I have observed minimal wear on the brake pads even after over 5 years of constant operation. To further extend the lifespan of the brake system, it is advisable to only engage and release the brake when the motor is stopped, unless in the event of a power failure. Regular maintenance and careful operation can help prolong the life of the brake system.</p>

            <p>It is important to be able to sense the engagement and disengagement of SEWs, as they play a crucial role in operation. Despite not working with SEWs for a while, I recall overseeing over 100 units in the plant without encountering any malfunctions. These SEWs were designed to be fail-safe, primarily serving to hold rather than stop operations, as Gary mentioned in case of a power outage.</p>
