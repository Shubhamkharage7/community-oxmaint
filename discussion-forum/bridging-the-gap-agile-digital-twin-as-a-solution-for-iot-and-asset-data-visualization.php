                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>The use of IoT and other asset data is commonly showcased to stakeholders through BI/KPI dashboards such as Tableau and Domo. These platforms effectively display performance metrics through charts and graphs, with some offering more visually appealing graphics. While some options like PowerBI are cost-effective, they have limitations when it comes to handling large amounts of data, especially real-time data, and may not be as engaging as dynamic visualizations seen in everyday media like games or movies. On the other hand, Digital Twins (DTs) require significant data inputs, making them expensive to develop and maintain. A full-scale DT can take months or even years to create, potentially causing delays in implementation. While DTs are valuable for tasks like designing jet engines, they may not be as effective for modeling real-time asset data. Recognizing this gap, we propose the concept of an Agile Digital Twin that bridges the divide between traditional dashboards and DTs. This approach would offer a middle ground in terms of data volume, cost-effectiveness, and speed of implementation, blending a development philosophy with streamlined technical requirements. We welcome comments, thoughts, and feedback on this idea from the community. -------------------------------- Kenneth Smith, Co-Founder of Hopara --------------------------------</p>

            <p>Consider exploring Matterport and the innovative Connex platform developed by JFC & Associates. By merging IoT and EAM technologies, they offer 3D visualization capabilities for digital twins. Through sensor integrations and EAM system back-end integration, they provide a comprehensive visual overlay and asset management system linkage. Based in Florida with a presence in Boston, JFC & Associates' expertise in Matterport is worth reaching out to. Discover more at https://www.jfc-associates.com/matterport. I would recommend connecting with them, Kenneth. ------------------------------ John Gould ------------------------------ 

Original Message: Sent: 06-07-2023 15:20 From: Kenneth Smith Subject: Is there a gap in the IoT/asset data viz space between BI/KPI dashboards and Digital Twins IoT and asset data are typically showcased through BI/KPI dashboards like Tableau and Domo. While effective for displaying operating performance charts, these systems have limitations in handling real-time data and engaging visualizations. On the other hand, Digital Twins require significant data and time investment, making them less suitable for real-time asset data modeling. MIT's AI Lab team sees an opportunity for Agile Digital Twins to bridge the gap between dashboards and full-scale Digital Twins, offering more data capabilities at a lower cost and faster launch time. Your feedback is welcomed. ------------------------------ Kenneth Smith, Co-Founder Hopara ------------------------------</p>

            <p>When considering both cost and effectiveness, the use of wireless options for monitoring systems may not always be the revolutionary solution it claims to be. Wireless systems can come with a range of expenses, including sensors, batteries, battery replacements, monthly data storage costs, and the need for analysts, whether AI or human. These costs can add up to a substantial capital outlay, especially when implemented remotely at remote sites. While wireless monitoring may be a cost-effective option in certain scenarios, such as at remote locations, it may not be the most suitable choice for manufacturing facilities at this time.

Despite the use of wireless sensors, traditional methods involving trained personnel on-site with analyzers and data management skills are still necessary to ensure accurate data collection and analysis. Managing defective sensors and base stations can be a challenging task that is often underestimated. Additionally, wireless sensors may not be able to detect certain issues that human personnel can, such as packing conditions, lubrication problems, and equipment malfunctions.

Ultimately, it is the people and the organizational culture that make a plant reliable, not just the technology. While wireless sensors may have their advantages, they may not be the ultimate solution they are marketed to be. Perhaps in the future, advancements in technology will make wireless sensors more effective, but for now, they may not be the ideal choice for every situation.</p>
