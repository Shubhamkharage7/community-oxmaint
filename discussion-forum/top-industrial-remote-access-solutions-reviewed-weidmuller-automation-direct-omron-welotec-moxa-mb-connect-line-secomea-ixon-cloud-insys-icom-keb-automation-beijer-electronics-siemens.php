                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>After deciding to charge for a previously free service, I have been exploring alternative options. If you have experience with any of these services or knowledge to share, please do so. Storing all my eWONs on separate accounts would now cost £17,000 per year, which is not feasible. Here is my research on potential alternatives, listed in no particular order as I discovered them.

Weidmuller offers quick access for simplified maintenance, either stand-alone or with extended Industrial IoT functionalities. The service appears to be free for the first 6 months, but pricing information for subsequent periods was difficult to find due to excessive irrelevant information on their website.

Automation Direct provides a basic free VPN service, or users can opt for paid services such as cloud logging and alarm notifications. The initial device cost is $400.

Omron's Remote Access Solution appears to only have a Windows client available. Pricing information was inconsistent, with some sources stating the device had been discontinued.

Welotec offers VPN and Industrial Remote Access solutions for secure networking. Deployment seems to be handled in-house by the company.

Moxa's Remote Connect Suite, while secure, is priced over $1000 per device, making it a costly option.

MB connect line's mbNET industrial router is a versatile and secure option for connecting machines to the Internet. They offer a basic free type, but the company is affiliated with Redlion and HMS Networks.

Secomea's remote access solution offers scalable plans, but pricing details have to be requested through a quote.

IXON Cloud provides transparent pricing with a free standard package. The device price is around £405 from a UK supplier.

INSYS ICOM's VPN service offers a free trial, but pricing information must be obtained from a local partner company.

KEB Automation's C6 ROUTER allows for remote maintenance of industrial plants with a specially designed VPN router. There is no mobile app connectivity available.

Beijer Electronics' CloudVPN Gateway Ethernet device is priced at $710 with no apparent ongoing charges.

Siemens' Remote Networks Overview requires an IT department to set up a VPN server system.

If you have additional information on any of these systems or know of any other companies or devices I may have missed, please share your insights.</p>

            <p>According to BryanG, the Phoenix Contact mGuard Secure Cloud requires an in-house VPN server, making it ideal for companies with an IT department. To access the free Secure Cloud, users must purchase and set up a Phoenix Contact mGuard Router and install a VPN client on their computer. Exor offers a similar solution with Corvina Cloud, available in HMIs or gateway devices. Users can opt for pay-as-you-go VPN access or an unlimited option at an affordable price.</p>

            <p>To enhance the security of your network, it is recommended to add a Phoenix Contact mGuard Router, available in various versions, and ensure a VPN client is installed on your device. Phoenix Contact offers support for several compatible VPN clients. Are you looking for an Ethernet mGuard Router part number and pricing information? Additionally, are you interested in mobile phone VPN clients? Feel free to provide any corrections or additional details.</p>

            <p>Another option to consider is the Tosi-box, although the pricing may fluctuate. It is expected to be in a similar range as the Beijer one. Alternatively, Tailscale VPN is a potential solution that claims to be user-friendly within networks, eliminating the need for router and firewall configurations. It might be beneficial to explore this option, especially since they offer a free tier for testing purposes.</p>

            <p>BryanG stated his thanks for the correction and inquired about the part number and price for an Ethernet mGuard Router, as well as the availability of mobile phone VPN clients. The entry-level option would be the CLOUD CLIENT 1101T-TX/TX - Router with the Phoenix Contact part number 1221706, priced at around $590. The product page for this router can be found here. According to Phoenix Contact mGuard Secure Cloud documents, it is compatible with iOS VPN clients, although this compatibility has not been tested yet. More information can be found on the Phoenix Contact website.</p>

            <p>I currently utilize Weintek screens and Weincloud for automation purposes. With a one-time purchase of an access card for approximately $80 AU, you gain lifetime access. The system offers a secure VPN setup and features like email and push notifications. It seamlessly connects to PLCs with the help of a budget-friendly modem and a data-only SIM card. The screens support a wide range of drivers for different devices, making them versatile for various applications. While they may not have all the features of Omron NS screens, the cost savings are significant.</p>

            <p>Another option to consider is Tailscale VPN, which has been gaining popularity as an alternative to Tosi-box. While Tailscale offers a different approach, some users have raised concerns about the use of a USB key for Tosi-box. Additionally, there is a SoftKey available for Tosi-box priced at £130, though it is not clear if this cost is per user or per year. To get a better idea of pricing, you can refer to this link: [Link to Tosi-box Pricelist]. Considering the updated features and pricing, Tosibox may no longer be a viable choice for some users. For those interested in learning more about Tailscale VPN, you can find detailed information on how it works on their website. Keep in mind that Tailscale requires a compatible device to run on within your network.</p>

            <p>BryanG shared a comprehensive guide on the functionality of Tailscale, addressing the common query of how it operates. The team had been hesitant to provide details due to frequent changes, but now they have stabilized the system. To get Tailscale running, you must have a compatible device within a network. Simply install it on a Raspberry Pi and integrate it into the network using DIN-mount boxes designed for RPIs. Explore more about Tailscale's functionality at tailscale.com.</p>

            <p>Currently, I utilize Weintek screens alongside the Weincloud platform. However, Exor offers a comparable system that is HMI-centric, restricting communication only to the HMI and connected PLC. This limitation hinders my ability to interact with other devices such as serial servers, onboard computers, and video cameras.</p>

            <p>Certainly, aligning with the others, a specific device is required within the network. Simply install it on a Raspberry Pi and place it within the network. Some even come with DIN-mount boxes for the RPIs. On the website, I found a scrolling list discussing Raspberry Pi, Android, iOS, and MacOS. It details their operation without the necessity of fixed IP addresses, although to me, it seemed somewhat like 'black magic'. Explore further by clicking to expand.</p>

            <p>In 2020, after conducting research on the Stridelinx, I decided not to install it on any customer setups. Recently, I have been receiving emails about an expiring license for the Stridelinx "Card View" feature, a cloud-based HMI. The communication about the expiration was unclear and sent to a large number of recipients. Despite this, I find the Stridelinx system easy to set up and appreciate the common portal for accessing it. Our customers can remotely view Red Lion HMI screens via their own routers. Additionally, there are free Android and iPhone apps available for accessing the HMI on mobile devices. The basic VPN and HTTP Services features are expected to remain free in the future.

Regarding the Tosibox setup, I recently ordered another one for an upcoming in-house project. I was initially impressed by its security features when a vendor, who is now out of business, dropped one off on my shelf. Although we never sold or paid for it, the Tosibox system caught my attention. Unfortunately, we missed the opportunity to promote and utilize it due to timing constraints.</p>

            <p>I recently discovered these helpful products from Helmholz that have been a game-changer for me. Thank you for bringing them to my attention, as I was not aware that Helmholz offered such solutions. In the past, I have explored various alternatives to the S7-1200 memory cards, and Helmholz has consistently impressed me with their offerings.</p>

            <p>In 2020, I conducted research on the Stridelinx but never implemented it in any customer setups. Recently, I have been receiving emails about my expired license, even though I never purchased one as it was available for free at the time. I have also explored the Tosibox setup and have just placed an order for another one for an upcoming in-house project. This update from AD was poorly executed, with a product advisory being released two days after the license expiration notice, causing widespread confusion among users. It is worth noting that both StrideLinx and Beijer are white-labeled Ixon devices. While Ixon offers excellent direct support, purchasing through them may not be as straightforward as buying through AD.</p>

            <p>We appreciate your decision to link Stridelinx and Beijer to IXON devices. IXON offers a free basic account with a range of features, making it a convenient choice for many users. Additionally, one of our trusted suppliers carries IXON devices in stock. It may require some research, but IXON even provides an App for MacOS, catering to a variety of users including those who prefer Macs.</p>

            <p>Ixon provides their IXAgent application as a standalone option, which can be easily installed directly onto specific hosts without the need for their hardware. This gives users the flexibility to utilize IXAgent independently for remote monitoring and management.</p>

            <p>IXon also provides the IXAgentClick software, available for Raspberry Pi, Linux, and Windows operating systems. While Raspberry Pi runs on Linux, it is also compatible with various PLC/HMI manufacturers. However, one drawback is that the IXAgent software does not support Routing. Despite this limitation, I am highly considering IXon as my top choice, as I believe it is a leading solution for VPN access to machines when combined with a Linux edge data logging computer.</p>
