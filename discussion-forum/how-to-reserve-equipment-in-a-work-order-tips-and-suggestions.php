                    <p>Hello, are you familiar with how to reserve equipment in a work order? I have been trying to set up a process using PRT and creating a designated work center for a particular piece of equipment, but I am struggling to make it work. I am specifically looking to reserve a crane for a work order and ensure that no one else can use it until the work order is finished. Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to achieve this?

            <p>On average, what is the typical timeframe between when a job is physically completed and when the work order is marked as completed (TECO) in the system? Is it feasible to have a situation where a tool/equipment is reserved in the system but available in the shop physically? When designing our system, we deliberately chose not to incorporate this functionality.</p>

            <p>Joe, it's important for you to collaborate with an IT engineer to implement this new feature. Specifically, you need to ensure that your tools are registered in the SAP Plant Maintenance software. Once the implementation is complete by IT, be sure to conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to ensure the functionality is working correctly.</p>

            <p>Work centers can be utilized for machines in workshops or cranes in various industries. However, they are predominantly used in maintenance departments overseeing personnel. This is why I suggested utilizing PRT in SAP PM for efficiently reserving and handling tools and equipment. It is advisable to seek guidance from a SAP PM specialist for further assistance.</p>

            <p>In our workflow, we utilize work centers for cranes and typically designate them as sub-operations to the main operation they are needed for. This allows for automated scheduling of the crane along with its parent operation during capacity planning. I personally prefer work centers over PRTs as they are more user-friendly for our maintenance team and are widely understood, while PRTs are typically only comprehensible to advanced users.</p>

            <p>Great suggestion, David! I'm curious, if we have a single crane allocated to a work order, can we still use it for another work order? Does the work center setup have formulas in place to avoid double-booking the crane? I'm looking to improve my knowledge on capacity planning, so excuse me if my question seems basic. Appreciate your feedback.</p>

            <p>Production/Resource Tools, also known as PRT, are a type of equipment that can be assigned to activities in IE25. Unlike machines and fixed assets, PRTs are movable operating resources that are essential for completing tasks and can be used multiple times. One challenge is preventing others from using a PRT when there is only one available, as there is currently no way to secure or "lock it up."</p>

            <p>To prevent SAP from scheduling a work center, such as a crane, multiple times during the same period, adjust the work center's available capacity to 1 and set overallocation to 0%. For more information on capacity planning, utilize the advanced search features on this website and look for "capacity planning". Narrow your search to my postings for access to informative articles on the topic. Please disregard any previous comments about not using capacity planning, as I have since transitioned to a new location.</p>

            <p>We would like to discuss our process for scheduling heavy equipment, such as cranes and forklifts. Initially, we set up an operation on the maintenance order with a designated work center for the heavy equipment department, like EQW_EOY. Next, we allocate the necessary hours through a separate transaction, involving a conference call with all maintenance stakeholders and the heavy equipment department to select the top-priority tasks. Thank you, Mansour.</p>

            <p>Mansour, it is highly recommended to utilize Outlook or other email/scheduling software to reserve equipment efficiently. This method is commonly used for reserving conference rooms and has proven to be very effective. Calendar systems are a convenient tool for managing equipment reservations.</p>
