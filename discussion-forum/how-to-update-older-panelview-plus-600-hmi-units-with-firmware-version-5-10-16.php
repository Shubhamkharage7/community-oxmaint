                    <p>Hello, I have a few older PanelView Plus 600 HMI units (2711P-T6C20D, Ser D) that I wish to update with the latest firmware. The firmware version I am looking to install is v5.10.16, which I have already downloaded and executed. However, I am encountering an issue with the Firmware Upgrade Wizard as it does not provide the option to select the v5.10 firmware. The only options available are for versions ranging from v6.10 to v14.00. Can anyone advise me on how to proceed in order to select and generate a v5.10.16 CF card? Thank you.</p>

            <p>The device you possess is a "PanelView Plus 6" terminal, with a firmware version that is being indicated by the wizard. It seems you have the most current model from the previous series, but it may not be compatible with your current setup. The PanelView Plus terminals range from version 5.10.16 for the PanelView Plus, version 6.10 for the PanelView Plus 6, and the most recent version for PanelView Plus 7 (minimum revision unknown).</p>

            <p>Thank you for your input. I understand the situation and am aware that I have a PanelView Plus 600. However, I am facing difficulties in finding v5.10 in the Firmware Upgrade wizard as a selectable option to create the CF card for upgrading to v5.10.16 (currently on 5.10.06).</p>

            <p>Let's start by addressing the unfortunate news before clearing up any confusion. Unfortunately, you will need to utilize FT View Studio version 11 or an earlier version as the newer updates no longer support the older PanelView Plus terminals. However, you can easily download the older version and install it on a different device without needing a license if it is solely for a firmware upgrade.

To clarify the difference between PVP and PVP6: While PanelView Plus and PanelView Plus 6 may appear similar from the front, the logic modules at the back differentiate them. The Plus 6 models have a distinct wavy heatsink on the logic module, unlike the original Plus which has a flatter appearance with no wavy heatsink. Additionally, the Plus model logic module comes in silver or gold colors, whereas the Plus 6 is greyish in color. Another notable distinction is that the "Plus" uses a CompactFlash removeable media, whereas the "Plus 6" uses an SD card. Since you mentioned a CompactFlash card, it is clear that you have the original PanelView Plus model.

Remember, you will need to have version 11 or an earlier version to successfully complete the firmware upgrade process.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information. I currently have various versions of the software, including FT6, 6.1, 7, and 14. I will try to download v11 and proceed from there. Your detailed explanation has been very helpful. I am concerned about potential issues arising from trying to install an older version on top of a newer one (FT VS). Should I uninstall the current version (v14) to avoid any compatibility problems during installation?</p>

            <p>To avoid the hassle of uninstalling your current version to install an older one, consider using a virtual machine. Many users in this forum rely on virtual machines for their flexibility and convenience. VMware Workstation Player, a popular choice, was previously available for free for personal use. VirtualBox is another option that offers its software for free, with the option of an Extension Pack for additional features. It's worth exploring these options, especially if you prefer not to clutter your physical machine with manufacturer software. Consider the licensing implications for commercial use, and make the choice that best suits your needs.</p>

            <p>Utilizing virtual machines (VMs) is highly recommended for running automation software, especially if you encounter issues like software crashes or instability. Personally, I first turned to VMs when my RSView Studio (now known as FT View Studio) software crashed and was impossible to completely uninstall, reinstall, or repair. Currently, I have VMs set up for various versions of View Studio including 5.00, 5.10, 8.2, 9, 11, and 12.

In my experience, View Studio can be a bit unstable at times, which is why running it in a VM sandbox environment is ideal. This ensures that any issues are contained within the VM, making it easier to restore and preventing any disruptions to other systems. Virtual machines provide a secure and isolated space for running View Studio and other automation software, offering peace of mind and easier troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>I have experimented with running VMware on both Windows 11 as a host and as a guest, but I encountered constant freezing issues that hindered my ability to perform tasks such as drag and drop for software installation. It is essential to investigate this further, considering the ample power of my PC. If I had a Windows 10 ISO file, I would have likely opted to install it as the guest operating system instead.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I encountered compatibility issues between earlier versions of VMware and Windows 11 on my host machine. This resulted in blue screen errors and continuous reboots in my virtual machine's operating system. Upgrading to VMware version 17 resolved these issues, as I was previously using VMware v15.

I have not yet tested Windows 11 as a guest OS, as I primarily use Windows 10 for virtualization. To prevent freezing, it is essential to allocate an appropriate amount of RAM to the virtual machine. For instance, if your computer has 16GB of RAM, allocating 8GB to the VM should leave sufficient memory for the host system to operate smoothly. Over-allocating RAM to the VM can cause system slowdowns or crashes. It is essential to assign only the necessary amount of RAM to the virtual machine to avoid performance issues.</p>
