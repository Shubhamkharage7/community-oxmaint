                    <p>Upon attempting to alter the data from a specific format to another, an Error was encountered by the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) indicating that the data type is invalid and the argument must match the parameter data type.

            <p>Unlike boolean operations, FLL instructions primarily work with words (whole bytes) when handling values, similar to other instructions like MOV and CLR. Many users tend to steer clear of bool arrays due to the fact that most of their intended functionality can be accomplished by manipulating individual bits of a DINT. However, if you find it necessary to utilize a bool array, consider placing it within a User-Defined Data Type (UDT) as certain operations will accept a UDT as a valid destination regardless of the data types it contains.</p>

            <p>By pressing F1 on the FLL instruction, you can access detailed information about it in your web browser. Unfortunately, this feature does not function with BOOLs. One workaround is creating a separate array of false bools and transferring them to the one you are unlatching. Alternatively, a more efficient method is consolidating all BOOLs into single bits of a DINT, allowing for easy unlatching by simply moving a 0 into the DINT.</p>

            <p>When using a Function Block in PLC programming, it's important to remember that the input source should be an integer value (such as SINT/INT/DINT), not a BOOL value. Trying to input 32 bits into a single bit will not work effectively. It's best to avoid using BOOL arrays as they have limitations and many instructions do not support them as a source or destination. Instead, consider creating a User-defined Data Type (UDT) with multiple BOOL members. For example, I created a UDT with 64 individual bool members and used it in an FLL instruction. By manually setting some BOOL tags and triggering the FLL, I was able to zero out all 64 bits. This process may be tedious as it involves creating each BOOL member of the UDT individually, but copy and paste can help streamline the process. Feel free to experiment with larger UDTs to see how the FLL handles more than 32 bits effectively.</p>

            <p>For improved memory usage and efficiency, consider using bits instead of bools. You can achieve this by creating an Array of Two Dints and utilizing the bits of the dints. The first bit would be AutoCalNotReady_1.0, while the last bit would be AutoCalNotReady_2.31. Simply compare the value of the dints - if AutoCalNotReady_1 is greater than 0 or AutoCalNotReady_2 is greater than 0, set not ready to 1. This approach is not only more efficient but also helps optimize memory usage.</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, Ken Moore recommended using bits instead of bools to improve memory efficiency in programming. He suggested creating an Array of Two Dints and utilizing the bits of the dints for better memory usage. This approach, such as with AutoCalNotReady_1.0 and AutoCalNotReady_2.31, can lead to more efficient memory usage. By comparing the value of the dint and checking if AutoCalNotReady_1 or AutoCalNotReady_2 is greater than 0, it is possible to determine readiness.

Hi Ken, I am currently focused on reducing memory usage in my program and I found your suggestion about using arrays of DINT instead of BOOL quite intriguing. After researching the memory sizes of different data types, I came across a helpful article on PLC Data Types & Structures - Allen Bradley PLC RSLogix 5000 Basics Programming BOOL INT DINT Arrays.

Based on my findings from the article, an INT is 16 bits while a DINT is 32 bits. However, I encountered some confusion when it came to determining the size of a BOOL. Some sources online suggest that a BOOL equals 4 bytes (16 bits), unless it is part of an array where it becomes 1 bit. This discrepancy makes it challenging to ascertain the exact size of a BOOL. It seems questionable that a single BOOL could be the same size as an INT.

I would appreciate it if the community at PLCTalk could provide further clarification on this matter.</p>

            <p>In the world of ControlLogix, a bool may only be 1 bit in size, but it actually requires 1 word (equivalent to 32 bits) of memory storage. This means that for every bool used, a whole word is dedicated to storing it. It's almost as if using a BOOL is akin to using a DINT in terms of memory usage, which may come as a surprise to many PLC users.
Moving forward, it might be wise to be more conservative with the number of BOOLs used in programming, considering the memory implications.
A common question that arises is regarding the memory usage of BOOL arrays. If a BOOL tag like BOOLTAG takes up 32 bits of memory, what about a BOOL array like BOOLARRAY[7]? Would each element in the array also require 32 more bits, leading to a total of 64 bits for a 32-element BOOL array?
It's important to understand how memory is allocated in ControlLogix systems to optimize programming efficiency.</p>

            <p>As pointed out by alan_505, the CLX platform operates on a 32-bit system, meaning each bool is stored in a 32-bit memory location. This results in 31 bits of wasted memory for each bool. This information is typically covered in CLX training sessions. If you create a 32-element BOOL array, it will consume the same amount of memory as a 32-element DINT array, with each bool requiring 32 bits. Therefore, using DINT arrays ensures no memory is wasted, allowing you to utilize all 32 bits for single instructions. In the past, a common practice was to create a large array of DINTs, typically around 10 elements, and label the array as "BITS." When needing to use a memory bit in logic, an alias tag like "One_Shot_1" would be created and linked to a specific bit in the BITS array, such as BITS1.0.</p>

            <p>In a quest to optimize program memory usage, thehoneybadger sought advice on utilizing DINT arrays instead of BOOL in PLC programming. Research revealed that an INT is 16 bits while a DINT is 32 bits. However, determining the exact size of a BOOL proved challenging. Some sources suggest that a BOOL equals 4 bytes (16 bits), but the size may vary when used in an array. Seeking clarification, thehoneybadger turned to PLCTalk for guidance.

According to theLogix 5000 Controllers Design Considerations manual, a minimum memory allocation for data in a tag is 4 bytes. Data is stored in multiples of 4 bytes, regardless of the actual size of the data type used. To further optimize storage, either arrays or User-Defined Data Types (UDTs) can be employed. Arrays allow for contiguous storage, while UDTs can pack data efficiently in memory.

In a surprising revelation, thehoneybadger learned that using a standalone BOOL in Logix PLCs consumes memory equivalent to a DINT. This fact, while not widely advertised, is a common aspect of computer systems where data is accessed in word chunks. To minimize memory usage, it is advisable to use fewer BOOLs and consider the overhead associated with arrays and tag names, which consume memory per character.

Upon questioning the memory consumption of BOOL tags versus BOOL arrays, it was confirmed that a BOOL array of size [32] will only use 32 bits for storage. The memory requirement increases incrementally with the size of the array, with a small additional overhead for being an array. Therefore, a 32-element BOOL array will require a total of 64 bits, taking into account both storage and overhead.</p>

            <p>When thehoneybadger posed an additional question related to a repetitive task, it sparked a conversation on finding a more efficient method. The task, similar to the one described earlier, involves comparing 48 "OR" possibilities. Is there a way to streamline this process for better results? One suggestion offered by robertmee is to use a loop and increment an integer for each xic[index]. If the integer does not equal 0, at least one true statement exists. The code snippet provided demonstrates the execution of 48 ORs, showcasing the potential for optimization in the comparison process.</p>

            <p>In agreement with alan_505's observation, the CLX platform operates on a 32-bit framework, leading to 31 bits of memory being wasted for each bool stored. This information is typically covered in CLX training sessions. When creating a 32-element BOOL array, the same memory consumption as that of a 32-element DINT array is incurred, with 32 bits allotted per Bool. Opting for an array of Dints ensures that all 32 bits are utilized efficiently without any waste, allowing for the allocation of each bit to single instructions. A preferred coding approach involves using DINTS with aliasing bits. Although there may be a temptation to convert BOOLs to DINT bits, sticking to this strategy can prevent unnecessary headaches. This method has proven successful in my programming endeavors and I plan to continue implementing it in the future. For detailed insights into CLX practices, PLCTalk (for me) is a valuable resource.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, user drbitboy shared code labeled as "48ORs" in a programming context. The code snippet involves a loop labeled as "ORloop" that engages with specified indexes for source A and source B. The snippet also includes various commands like "ADD" and "JMP" for processing the data. After receiving this information, the user expressed their gratitude and mentioned attempting to implement the code for further analysis.</p>

            <p>According to the Logix 5000 Controllers Design Considerations manual, a minimum of 4 bytes of memory is allocated for data in a tag. Memory is accessed in words, meaning that even when using just a single bit, the processor has to handle a full 4-byte word, resulting in wasted space. Whether it's an 8-bit SINT, a 16-bit INT, or any other data type, all tags occupy a multiple of 4 bytes due to the 32-bit processors utilized. This information is crucial for efficient memory management in industrial control systems.</p>

            <p>I tried to optimize my code by converting the index to an array, enabling me to use a consistent "index" reference for all future loops in the program. However, I encountered an error message stating "Invalid array subscript specifier" when referencing the OTU, B_Engaged_TS[Index[0]]. Strangely, the other instances of using Index[0] are working fine. Any suggestions on why this specific instruction is not accepting it and how I can troubleshoot this issue?</p>

            <p>Looking back at some amusing memories, I set out to streamline a repetitive task by implementing more efficient code in the hopes of reducing memory usage. I ended up replacing four redundant tasks with four identical loops, and monitored the memory usage after each modification. The result: I successfully achieved my goal of code elegance, but unfortunately fell short on reducing memory usage.</p>
