            <p>In this particular situation, appearances can be deceiving when it comes to energy levels and the color green. This complexity is characteristic of TS OTL/U, making it challenging to decipher at times. It's important to remember that OTU is a valid factor in this scenario, influencing the perceived energy levels. Is it starting to make sense now?</p>

            <p>When it comes to TS OTL/U, looks can be deceiving. Just because something appears green and energized doesn't mean it's functioning correctly. This can make troubleshooting TS OTL/U issues tricky. It's important to remember that appearances can be misleading, and OTU may be the cause of your OTL looking correct. Still confused? It may just be a visual glitch. Click to expand for more insight.</p>

            <p>Hershfam asked if the issue was primarily a visual bug. When examining the specific bit, both (L) and (U) appear green because they represent the same value. It's important to focus on the actual value of the bit, whether it is 0 or 1, and make decisions based on its true status.</p>

            <p>When troubleshooting programs, I often insert "traps" such as adding a rung after the OTU rung with XIC LatchedBit OTE ItIsTrue. These traps help me identify issues and test the functionality of the program effectively.</p>

            <p>Hershfam clarified that it is not just a visual bug, but rather an indication of the tag's state. The OTL/OTU/OTE instructions show the value of the tag, which can only be 0 or 1. Even if both latch and unlatch instructions are true, the color displayed only represents the tag's value. If you are experiencing a situation where the tag keeps reverting to 1 when toggled, it is likely due to another instruction later in the scan setting that is setting the tag to 1.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to dmroeder, the status of the OTL and OTU indicates that the tag being used in both instructions has a value of "1". It is common for individuals to misconstrue the meaning of the Unlatch when observing it. When an OTU is highlighted, it signifies that the tag is currently activated, not unlatched. The OTE/OTL/OTU displays the real-time status of the tag value, not the specific action being executed. It is possible that there may be another instance of OTE or OTL later in this code that is overriding the current display. It is important to note that a "toggle" impacts the tag, not the logic of the program. Although the logic may respond to this alteration, the toggle itself does not alter the program's logic. Therefore, if you toggle the bit off, the logic may automatically turn it back on. OG</p>

            <p>Bob O described it as "That's a feature, not a bug." This choice was made by the Allen-Bradley (A-B) IDE programmers in the past. It's important to note that not all PLC IDEs follow the same convention. By searching for "otl otu bit display green" on Google or this site, you can find past discussions on this topic. A-B IDEs display relay logic based on whether the relay instruction is an input or an output. Inputs show the result of a contact instruction's output rung, while outputs show the operand bit's value for output coils. The display reflects the operand bit value retrieved at a specific point in time, which may not align with when the instruction was assessed. 

One drawback is that in online mode, you don't see the actual result of the rung at the time of evaluation. This would be resource-intensive in terms of computation and memory usage. However, one advantage is that the display remains consistent in both online and offline modes. The screenshot provided likely depicts offline mode, as the OTU input rung would appear as True otherwise.</p>
