My manager is a fan of Automationdirect and after doing some research on Google and YouTube, I found that some of their instructions lack details. It could also be that I didn't fully understand them, which is why I couldn't figure out how to solve the problem at hand. I will gather more information and seek clarification. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Newbie PLC programmer PLCnoobTW expressed gratitude for the valuable information provided by the community. After completing some introductory training and undertaking minor projects involving simple commands, they are now encountering difficulties with VFD control in Do-More programming. The challenge lies in comprehending the existing programs left behind by a former employee, as updates are required in the coming years. Why not share your program here for assistance in understanding specific sections? Sometimes, starting from scratch and developing your own program can be the best way to gain a solid grasp of the concepts involved.</p>

            <p>The connection between a VFD control and a PLC is crucial for efficient operation. It can be established through various means such as communication protocols or digital/analog I/O. To provide more accurate and helpful responses, it is important to specify details like the PLC and VFD type. Sharing additional information, such as drawings or code snippets, can lead to better suggestions and solutions. Feel free to upload PDFs or images (keeping in mind size limits) to enhance the discussion.</p>
