                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As a Siemens user, I am delving into my initial AB program project. The client has requested the use of Ladder logic for all programming tasks. I am faced with the challenge of handling a significant amount of data, specifically 3 integers worth of boolean values, which are being extracted from a set of non-concurrent words received via the bus. These words need to be broken down into individual boolean operators. While I am aware that I could manually convert each word bit into a local argument through a ladder run or directly use the boolean operator from the word, I am considering creating a User-Defined Data Type (UDT) structure to streamline the process. However, I am unsure if this is achievable in AB programming.

Initially, I explored using BTD to retrieve and organize the words, but it seems to be incompatible with UDT type placement. I also considered utilizing a COP instruction, which works efficiently for individual words but falls short when dealing with 3 words. I attempted to create an array of words, transform my non-concurrent words into a concurrent format, and then use the COP function to transfer them into the UDT structure. Unfortunately, COP rejected being assigned to the header of the array instead of a direct array address.

Is there a method or technique that I have overlooked in accomplishing this task efficiently in AB programming?</p>

            <p>It seems like you are heading in the right direction. If your User-Defined Type (UDT) includes 96 BOOL variables, you should be able to efficiently copy data using ARRAY[0] as the Source and the name of the UDT instance as the Destination with a Length of 1. (In this case, ARRAY refers to a DINT[3] array, and ARRAY[0] is the initial DINT value in the array.) This approach can help streamline your programming and optimize data transfer processes.</p>

            <p>To copy the first 48 (96?) bits of the_array[0], the_array[1], and the_array[2] to the_udt, with the assumption that the UDT consists of 3 words, you can use the following code: Code:COP the_array[0] the_udt 1. This operation will transfer the specified data seamlessly.</p>

            <p>Utilizing structured text for this task could be effective, but the customer specifically requests all information to be formatted in a ladder logic. In the ladder instruction related to COPy, I am able to indicate a length, but cannot determine a destination location if my User-Defined Type (UDT) is defined using individual BOOLS. It is possible that I may be misinterpreting your guidance. If it were possible to specify a destination address with the COPy function, this solution could potentially be successful.</p>

            <p>In response to CM3's request for structured text, it is possible to provide ladder logic format as preferred by the customer. The data copied by a COP instruction is dependent on the destination data type. For example, if the destination is a 3 DINT long UDT, it will copy 3 DINTs of data starting at the Source (and repeating if Length is greater than 1). Specific members of the UDT do not need to be specified unless only a portion of the UDT needs to be copied.</p>

            <p>In ladder logic programming, the data copied by a COP instruction is based on the destination data type. For example, if the destination is a UDT that consists of 3 DINTs, the instruction will copy 3 DINTs of data from the source. If the length is greater than 1, the process will repeat. The mnemonic form used for specifying ladder logic in many Allen-Bradley IDEs is essential to understand. By double-clicking on the rung number, a text box will appear displaying the mnemonic form for that specific rung, or it will be blank if the rung is empty.</p>

            <p>If I understand these instructions correctly, by instructing the copy function to start at the first DINT in the array and copy 48 bits, it will effectively copy all 3 DINTs within the array.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure accurate copying, specify TempWordStack[0] as the source. The copying process does not automatically start from the beginning of the array. Even if the array is shorter than 48 bits, the copying process will still function, but the additional bits will be sourced from unexpected locations. Set your Length parameter to 1, with the unit of measure being the data type of the destination. As 'SW' consists of 48 bits, the copying process will iterate 48 bits with each cycle. In essence, you are instructing it to copy '[Length] * [size of SW]' bits. If you are not working with BOOL, you could directly target the first member with the COP and adjust the length accordingly. However, COP does not directly interact with BOOLs. While data alignment may sometimes require copying 64 bits, it is irrelevant in this scenario.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that the copy length should be set to 1, as the "destination element" is seen as a single array of elements, rather than the total of 48 individual elements. Thank you to everyone for your valuable input, it is truly appreciated!</p>

            <p>CM3 mentioned that the length of the copy should be set to 1 because the "destination element" is considered as one array of elements, not as the individual 48. Many thanks to everyone for the helpful input! In essence, COP duplicates 'chunks of data' and determines the chunk size based on the destination. If the destination is 'Array,' it means copying the entire array. If the destination is 'Array[X],' it signifies copying one unit of the array data type from position X (with the option to increase the length for further filling of the array). Keep in mind that a User-Defined Type (UDT) may be more complex than a simple array. In cases where the data is non-contiguous and being copied from something that is contiguous, this could lead to problems.

OkiePC then added that they now have four copies of the 861-page manual. It's advisable to inform people about the nature of hyperlinks in your content. And don't forget, if you purchase a dozen copies, the next one is free!</p>
