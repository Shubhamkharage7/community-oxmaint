                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>We have two lines equipped with S7-414 PLCs that are running the same program. Our Maxon valves are used to kickstart the combustion process, which is closely monitored through safety blocks. However, there is an issue that arises occasionally when attempting to relight the furnaces: the PLC enters STOP mode when opening the final Maxon valve out of six, with no consistent pattern in which valve triggers the issue. Our OEM has investigated the problem with assistance from Siemens, but a solution has not been found yet. The diagnostic fault buffer indicates data corruption in the safety program before outputting to the F I/Ologics. After performing a warm restart, the system goes back to normal operation, but this issue may persist a few times before all the Maxon valves can be opened smoothly. It is worth noting that the Maxon valves are 110VAC, while the PLC control runs on 24VDC.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If the F-CPU enters STOP mode and shows a "Data corruption in the safety program..." message in the diagnostics buffer, what should you do? When it comes to Siemens and S7 safety expertise, it's recommended to reach out to Siemens Support directly rather than going through an intermediary. Assessing the competence of the OEM is crucial in such situations. Dealing with safety issues is never simple; it requires expertise and prompt action.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  What could be causing the S7-414 PLC to enter STOP mode when opening the Maxon valves?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The issue could be related to data corruption in the safety program as indicated by the diagnostic fault buffer, leading to the PLC entering STOP mode. The inconsistent triggering of the issue by different valves suggests a potential underlying problem within the safety blocks or communication between the PLC and the Maxon valves.</p>
