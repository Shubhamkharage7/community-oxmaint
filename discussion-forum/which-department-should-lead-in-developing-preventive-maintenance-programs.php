            <p>Individuals or teams with expertise in equipment design, operation, failure modes, and maintenance requirements are crucial for effective maintenance planning. These professionals are able to assess equipment manuals, technical documentation, industry standards, and regulations that influence preventive maintenance (PM) schedules, drawing from past experiences to determine necessary tasks and frequencies. Key roles in this process typically include Maintenance Planners, Area Maintenance personnel, and Engineers. While Operations staff may provide valuable input based on their familiarity with equipment behavior, their involvement in PM development is contingent upon their technical knowledge. In many cases, Operations may alert Maintenance to unusual occurrences or issues, leading to the creation of new PM tasks. However, the ultimate decision on PM validity and frequency rests with the Maintenance Engineering team, which creates and approves PM task lists in collaboration with technicians and supervisors. Safety recommendations from HAZOP studies also play a crucial role in refining the PM program, with Operations, Engineering, and Maintenance all contributing insights. Feedback from Operations and Quality Assurance (QA) during equipment lifecycle may prompt adjustments to the PM program as part of corrective or preventive actions, subject to review by Maintenance Engineers before incorporation into the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Overall, any new PM tasks or modifications require approval from Maintenance Engineers before being implemented in the CMMS.</p>

            <p>I strongly recommend that all four options be considered. One of the main challenges I encounter when transitioning between organizations is the time-consuming and ineffective nature of PM programs. It is crucial for our craftsmen or area maintenance staff to take the lead on PM programs, with the rest of the team providing support. This will help maximize the results and minimize instances of ineffective completion of PM tasks. In many cases, PMs are simply being "pencil whipped" without real benefits. Management often focuses on tracking PMs for upper management approval, losing sight of the original purpose of PM tasks. In summary, it is vital for area maintenance or craftsmen to take responsibility for PMs, while engineers should offer support and resources to the maintenance team.

            <p>One common issue I encounter when moving between different organizations is the time-consuming and ineffective nature of project management programs. These programs may be deemed worthless due to a lack of involvement from technical experts in their development, or because technical professionals are using non-technical approaches to define project requirements and timelines.</p>

            <p>Often, the PM sheet is commonly used as a checklist. However, when craftsmen are properly trained and educated, they view the list as a valuable tool, much like the idiot light on a car dashboard. The checklist should serve as a guide to help remember what needs to be checked, rather than as the sole focus of their job. It is essential that PMs are viewed as a tool for craftsmen to utilize, rather than as a task to be completed by management. This shift in mindset allows for a greater focus on the equipment itself, rather than just completing tasks on a checklist. The key reasons why some PMs may seem ineffective include not identifying the correct issues, lacking the necessary skills to address root problems, not being held accountable for equipment maintenance beyond the checklist, and prioritizing quantity of completed PMs over Mean Time Between Failures.

            <p>To address common issues, it is essential to include in the maintenance manual clear instructions on inspecting and cleaning the XYZ part or section of the equipment. These instructions should detail the appropriate methods for cleaning, including the use of solvents. By regularly cleaning this specific section, technicians have the opportunity to assess the condition of its components. This process enables technicians to identify wear and tear, loose parts, or any other issues that may require immediate attention.</p>

            <p>Allow me to share my extensive experience in assisting organizations in developing and reviewing maintenance programs for over two decades. One crucial point I want to emphasize is the importance of involving operators in the maintenance process. Operators play a key role in the day-to-day upkeep of equipment, with some industries relying on them for over 75% of preventive maintenance tasks. It is essential to recognize operator inspections and cleaning tasks as integral parts of the maintenance program, as overlooking their contributions can lead to duplication of efforts and a loss of credibility among technicians.

Furthermore, it is not enough to simply write preventive maintenance tasks; documenting the rationale and failure modes behind each task is equally important. Storing this information securely ensures that it can be easily accessed for future reference and enhances the efficiency of the maintenance program in the long run. Neglecting to establish a proper system for documentation may result in confusion and inefficiency when equipment failure occurs.

In conclusion, involving operators in the maintenance process and documenting all preventive maintenance tasks are critical for the success of any maintenance program. By following these practices, organizations can ensure smooth operations and minimize downtime due to equipment failures.</p>

            <p>I have observed a concerning trend within organizations when it comes to developing and implementing comprehensive maintenance strategies. Since the late 90s, I have faced challenges in securing resources for maintenance strategy programs in both large and small organizations. This task has become increasingly difficult over the years, making it almost impossible since the early 2000s. The push to transfer knowledge and shift the working culture, while commendable, can often lead to failure in implementation. Many companies struggle to allocate the necessary time and resources for this process, making it virtually impossible to do it justice. This is not an easy viewpoint to express, but it is a reality that needs to be addressed.</p>

            <p>Steve, you make a valid point when you emphasize the importance of operators being involved in the development of maintenance tasks. Without their input, organizations miss out on a crucial aspect of maintenance. In addition to the reasons you mentioned, it's important to consider the following points.

1. The consequences of equipment failure often impact operators the most. They are at a higher risk of being harmed and are often responsible for cleaning up any environmental damage. When production is affected, they bear the brunt of the consequences. By involving operators in the risk evaluation process, we can better identify and mitigate potential risks.

2. The operational context of equipment plays a significant role in determining the maintenance strategy. Operators are well-positioned to provide insights on the operational context. It's essential to invest the time and expertise of the most competent individuals within the organization to develop a high-quality maintenance strategy. Cutting corners on strategy development can lead to unnecessary costs in the long run.

While it may be tempting to outsource strategy development to consultants due to time constraints, it's important to remember that no one understands the equipment and operations better than the internal team. Consultants can provide guidance and support, but ultimately, the maintenance plan should be devised by those who have firsthand knowledge. Remember, the goal is to create a sustainable and effective maintenance plan, not just to make a quick profit for consultants. Despite the challenges of implementation, sticking to these principles is essential for long-term success.</p>

            <p>Creating PM checklists can be beneficial for operators in the oil and gas industry. Operators typically focus on monitoring process and equipment parameters, while also conducting tasks like checking oil levels and performing minor top-ups. Their observations are then recorded in a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for the maintenance team to address.

It would be advantageous to see operators playing a more active role in developing formal PM checklists or participating in Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) processes. In other industries like mining or manufacturing, drivers who also serve as operators of heavy vehicles or machinery may take on maintenance responsibilities as well.

If you have any examples of operators being involved in PM development or taking on maintenance tasks in addition to their regular duties, please share them. This level of involvement can ultimately lead to more efficient and proactive maintenance practices in various industries.</p>

            <p>Vee, please don't take this personally. The strategic importance of allocating resources for this type of work has been widely discussed. However, the availability of these resources is becoming increasingly limited. As a managerial discipline, our aim is to promote strong reliability and effective risk management practices across all industries, not just those willing to invest extra resources to overcome implementation challenges. This is a key modern challenge we face. Our focus should be on a pragmatic approach to encourage as many organizations as possible to adopt good asset management practices. Regards,</p>

            <p>Operators should consider implementing PM checklists as part of their maintenance strategy development process. It is crucial for operators to actively participate in creating and implementing maintenance strategies instead of being sidelined. Incorporating 'best practices' and seeking input from operators, maintainers, specialists, and vendors is key to a successful maintenance approach. Neglecting these practices could result in serious consequences.

It is important to remember that not every maintenance task is carried out by a maintainer, and not every operational task is performed by an operator. Both maintenance and operational tasks are essential for keeping assets in working order. Tasks such as testing for hidden failures, instrument zero-checking, lubrication, cleaning, and tightening are commonly done by operators but do not fall under operational work. Operators may also undertake simple dismantling and reassembly tasks typically assigned to maintainers. These tasks are often not documented in the CMMS system, which is an important point to consider when evaluating Steve's observations.</p>

You mentioned that our goal as a managerial discipline should be to promote good reliability and effective risk management practices across all industries. It is important to emphasize that this should not be limited to only those industries open to advice and willing to invest additional resources to overcome implementation challenges. Consider a Quality Improvement project, for instance. Would all team members need to be consultants? Likely not, as having a facilitator from a consulting firm guiding the process may suffice. While quality is crucial, it is important to recognize that reliability plays a key role in achieving quality. It is essential for management to understand the significance of allocating resources appropriately to ensure reliable outcomes. Investing in high-quality resources is necessary for a job that could potentially cost us significantly if not done correctly. There is a correct approach and a more practical method to address resource shortages. It is crucial to get things right the first time to avoid lingering implementation challenges.</p>

            <p>According to Steve, it is essential to differentiate between operator inspections and cleaning tasks as part of maintenance. While operators may conduct some inspections and cleaning, the focus should be on preventive maintenance (PM) tasks. Operators should be responsible for equipment cleaning, but when it comes to PM, the emphasis should be on tasks beyond what operators typically do. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for PM should not overlook the time operators spend on cleaning and inspections. If operators align with the maintenance criteria outlined, they can contribute to PM development with approval required before inputting data into the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). Otherwise, they should provide recommendations or information for evaluation by the technical team handling PM development.</p>

            <p>In a discussion initiated by Josh, questions arose regarding the extent to which operators are responsible for the majority of preventive maintenance (PM) workload within a facility. Is this based on the number of work orders, manhours, or costs? The percentage seems notably high. As someone working in the pharmaceutical industry, I can attest to the detailed cleaning procedures required for manufacturing and packaging equipment. This involves operators disassembling, cleaning, reassembling, and inspecting equipment. Surprisingly, none of the time spent on these tasks is logged in the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) as PM hours or orders. While operator cleaning is crucial for equipment functioning, it is not accounted for in maintenance key performance indicators (KPIs) or the CMMS module. Instead, such cleaning is typically integrated into Production Planning processes. The only cleaning activities included in the PM workload are those carried out by mechanics as part of their scheduled maintenance tasks. These tasks may involve cleaning non-product contact areas such as chains, sprockets, and motors – aspects that fall outside the scope of operator responsibilities.</p>

            <p>Josh, I need some clarity on how we calculate the PM workload during shutdowns. Do we take into account overhauls and failure finding tasks, or do we only focus on online maintenance? Typically, our overhauls are included in PM Orders based on equipment and manufacturer recommendations. Are inspection tasks also factored into the PM workload? Here's how it breaks down: Maintenance personnel conduct inspections that are documented in PM Orders. Some PM inspections are assigned to Utilities Operators who are treated like another Maintenance crew, and these are also documented in PM Orders. However, inspections carried out as part of the daily, weekly, or monthly routines of Utilities Operators (or other Operations units) are not included in the CMMS.</p>

            <p>Dear Vee, I firmly believe in the importance of the topic we're discussing, and I won't waste time arguing about it. Quality and reliability are both crucial aspects, and rather than debate which is more important, I believe there are various approaches to consider. If a client is willing to invest in a reliability program, with a focus on knowledge transfer, change management, and project efficiency, then that's fantastic! I've been following this approach since 1991 and continue to do so whenever possible. However, not every client may have the resources to prioritize reliability in this manner. The landscape of reliability management is complex, and we must explore alternative solutions. We have a duty to promote the application of reliability concepts across industries, even when faced with challenges like limited resources or existing service provider contracts. It's unfair to label clients as wrong for seeking different solutions. Instead, our goal should always be to support them in improving their situation. Reliability enhancement is key to achieving this goal, and it's why we are here. Warm regards,</p>

            <p>Josh pointed out that while operators play a crucial role in maintenance tasks and checklist development, it's hard to believe they handle more than 50% of the workload. Let's delve into the numbers: in a two-shift operation, operators spend 15 minutes each shift on checks, totaling 1 hour per day and 400 man-hours annually. Technicians handle weekly, monthly, bi-annual, and annual tasks, amounting to 71 man-hours per year. In process plants, it's common to see operators conducting 4 hours of inspections per shift, with continuous surveillance in the control room. These figures provide valuable insights for maintenance planning. Feel free to analyze the data further. Steve</p>

            <p>Vibration analysis (VA) is an essential component of preventive maintenance (PM) workload, especially when integrated into a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This online monitoring activity should not be overlooked. Instead of eliminating VA from PM tasks, I recommend incorporating all significant PM activities to accurately assess the overall PM workload and provide a comprehensive perspective on maintenance needs.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Josh, in my opinion, online monitoring should be considered a vital component of preventive maintenance (PM), just like vibration analysis (VA). It seems we both share this perspective. Whether the monitoring is conducted through a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) or a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is not a crucial factor. 

For example, in a manufacturing setting where overhauls are predominantly based on the condition of the equipment, the approach may differ from that of a process industry where more intensive inspections are carried out. If these inspections lead to shutdown maintenance, they could be classified as preventive maintenance tasks, while the subsequent repairs may fall under corrective maintenance. 

In process industries, operators often dedicate a significant amount of time to conducting inspections throughout the day, every day, and during every shift. This daily inspection workload can be substantial and comparable to the preventive maintenance tasks performed by technicians.

My intention was not to delve into a debate on what constitutes PM and what doesn't, although it is indeed an intriguing topic. Instead, I aimed to contribute insights on the role of operators in PM analysis. 

On a related note, during a recent project in Taiwan, I observed that operators were skilled tradesmen with a strong tradition of passing down their expertise from one generation to the next. This signifies that the workforce in certain countries known for low-cost production is not merely inexpensive labor but rather skilled professionals contributing to the industry's competitiveness.

            <p>Steve, I believe we should clarify the statement that operators do more than 50% of the preventive maintenance (PM) workload. This statement may not be entirely accurate, as the percentage could be lower if we incorporate all PM tasks such as overhauls, failure finding, and inspections. It seems like major PM tasks carried out by the Maintenance team, like overhauls and inspections, were not considered in your calculation. Instead, you focused on comparing operator checks to technician checks. It's important to note that process parameter checks by operators and 24/7 surveillance by the Control Room on plant conditions are not typically classified as PM tasks. However, first line maintenance carried out by operators is considered PM and referred to as operator maintenance. If the technicians transition into operators, it could improve first line maintenance effectiveness.</p>

            <p>I apologize if there is any confusion, Josh. The numbers provided already factor in time-based overhauls, meaning parts are replaced regardless of their condition. Most organizations have shifted towards a more modern maintenance approach, primarily focused on condition-based maintenance. This approach differs from the traditional annual shutdowns where components were replaced regardless of condition.

We are discussing thousands of operator inspection hours, with a significant amount of work being done during yearly shutdowns. However, a lot of this work is corrective and based on condition. Attached are some verified results from a chemical plant. I can provide you with contacts at the plant who can further discuss these numbers. Feel free to reach out if you need more information.

While it is important for all departments (such as Planner, Operations, Area Maintenance, and Engineering) to be involved in the process, it is crucial to have a champion overseeing the program to ensure its effectiveness and continuous improvement. In my opinion, Engineering should play a key role in developing PM programs for crucial assets in a plant setting, as they typically handle the global aspects of plant operability and can optimize PM schedules.

While I agree with this notion to some extent, I believe it is important to consider the semantics of the situation. Instead of labeling them as Maintenance Engineers, perhaps we should refer to them as Reliability Engineers. This individual could come from various backgrounds such as engineering, technical operations, or consulting, but their primary focus is on championing reliability within an organization.

The role of the reliability engineer is to ensure that all necessary measures and resources are in place to maintain reliability. While the Maintenance Department may excel in performing tasks related to maintenance, they may not always be the best at developing reliable processes and procedures. This is where the reliability engineer steps in to create a strategic approach to Preventive Maintenance (PM) development, which is essential for ensuring reliability within an organization.

In essence, PM development should be a collaborative effort led by the Reliability Engineer. This individual takes into account the bigger picture and devises a strategy to enhance reliability. This is how I perceive the importance of having the right maintenance practices at the right time within my own organization.</p>

            <p>Eugene mentioned that there are a few options available. One example can be found at http://www.plant-maintenance.com/books/0831131543.shtml, although the reviews on the page are not very favorable. Has anyone else read this book and formed a different opinion? After reading negative reviews, I decided to both raise my PR and cancel it at the same time.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Steve, for clarifying the reason behind the high figure for operator preventive maintenance (PM). It appears that you incorporate operator monitoring as part of PM, which differs from our approach. Regardless, your strategy proves effective for overall plant management.</p>

            <p>After coming across some negative reviews, I decided to raise a purchase request and then promptly cancel it. A colleague of mine, who has a background in computer programming, highly recommends a certain book. He is skilled in detailed planning using Microsoft Project and is well-versed in CMMS. He even attended a workshop by Joel Levitt.

When it comes to maintenance books, there are countless options available. Some are practical guides, while others are more academic in nature. If you're in a new organization that lacks established procedures and systems, it's wise to avoid diving into complex theories like "RCM, RCM2, Weibull, and the like." Instead, focus on resources by Levitt and Wireman.

On the other hand, if your organization is well-established and surrounded by academically-inclined individuals proficient in statistical analysis and data management, then delving into academic literature may be more suitable. But when it comes to implementing a practical lubrication plan for machinery, practical guides are key, not theoretical discussions about P-F intervals.</p>

            <p>In tackling Maintenance Engineering problems, it is crucial to utilize practical solutions that cut straight to the chase. Academic resources may be more appropriate when undertaking tasks such as writing a thesis for a Master's Degree or preparing a proposal for approval. These tools are essential for navigating the complexities of maintenance challenges and advancing in your academic pursuits.</p>

            <p>Let's discuss the simplicity of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). RCM is straightforward and can be easily explained to any accountant in just 20 minutes, unless they are hearing impaired. It's the engineers and statisticians who have made it overly complicated, perhaps in pursuit of advanced degrees. However, as long as you grasp the principles of RCM task selection, you can effectively implement RCM. These principles revolve around four maintenance options: Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), Fixed Time Replacement, No Scheduled Maintenance for evident failures, and testing hidden functions for hidden failures. Setting intervals may involve some rules, but they are not overly complex if you stick to setting tasks within reasonable ranges. Avoid being swayed by the vendors of sophisticated statistical packages, as they are often limited in their practical applications. In my 25 years of experience, I have never needed more than a histogram or Pareto chart to effectively practice RCM. Steve.</p>
