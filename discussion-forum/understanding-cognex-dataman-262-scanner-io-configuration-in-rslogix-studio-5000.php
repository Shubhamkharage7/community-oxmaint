                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have been struggling with configuring 3 Cognex Dataman 262 scanners provided by a customer for a project using RSLogix Studio 5000. Despite being prepared to write trigger and comparison logic for our sorting system, I am unable to find information on the functions of different bits within the IO for these units. While my units support ethernet TCP/IP and I am utilizing the Cognex Add-On Profile (AOP) for the 260 series, the IO map only displays arrays of SINTs, with the option to change to DINTs or REAL, but SINT being the default. I am unsure of the functionality of output tags, unlike other Cognex scanners such as the Insight 7000 series which provide descriptive tags for both status and control sections of the controller tags. Despite downloading a document titled Control Commands from the Cognex website multiple times, I found it to be an empty HTML document with headers but no content. I have also contacted Cognex for assistance, but have not received a response yet. Attached are images of the controller tags, with the descriptive one being from the Insight 7000 camera. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>widelto mentioned to @Dirtleg that they followed their lead by utilizing Cognex AOP and shared their findings. After running into some issues, they deleted all three scanners from their IO tree, removed the associated module-defined tags, and recreated the modules. Surprisingly, the results mirrored what @Dirtleg experienced. The cause of the issue remains a mystery to them, but the problem has been resolved and everything is working smoothly now. Thanks for the guidance!</p>

            <p>Hello, can you assist me in determining why the "Decode Complete" signal did not activate? I am new to a production line that has been in operation for 2 years, and the scanner in question has been functioning previously. The parts continue down the line regardless of their pass or fail status, but I am interested in retrieving the serial numbers of the parts in this section of the line. Any advice or assistance you can provide would be greatly valued. Thank you.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can one access information on the functions of different bits within the IO for Cognex Dataman 262 scanners in RSLogix Studio 5000?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Answer: While the default display in the IO map may only show arrays of SINTs, there may be options to change to DINTs or REAL for more detailed information. Utilizing resources like the Cognex Add-On Profile (AOP) and contacting Cognex for assistance can also be helpful.</p>
