The test is complimentary until September 30th, but the cost will increase to $350 per test after October.

Despite our product solely requiring 24 volts for power, we too are subject to these fees. With Red Lion offering a wider range of products at lower prices, these fees significantly impact the cost of items like smaller displays.</p>

            <p>Rob mentioned that he has not received any updates from the company in the United Kingdom. It is possible that they are prioritizing the United States for their rollout.

As long as you can prove your abilities and successfully complete a 3-month probationary period, you have a good chance of getting hired. However, despite building panels for shipping to the US, we are still subject to inspection by a UL official. Despite having reservations about UL's standards and practices, they have a strong hold on the market and often exploit customers.</p>

            <p>Rob expressed his disappointment with the standards and practices of the dominant player in the market, who seem to prioritize profit over safety. This organization, once a non-profit focused on safety, shifted to a for-profit model, causing a decline in quality. Despite the dedicated employees who still uphold the original values, it has become increasingly challenging to maintain those ideals in the current profit-driven environment.</p>

            <p>According to ndzied1, the organization used to prioritize safety as a not-for-profit entity. However, since transitioning to a for-profit model, there has been a noticeable decline in their commitment to those ideals. Despite some employees still maintaining a dedication to the cause, the focus is increasingly shifting towards profit. This move towards capitalism has resulted in a perception of the organization as overly bloated and lacking integrity. UL, once known for its dedication to safety, is now seen as a joke.</p>

            <p>Several years ago, the ex-president of Red Lion made a lengthy complaint about being forced to pay exorbitant UL fees for each device. Though the original post is now lost, the sentiment remains the same. Despite our product only requiring 24 volts for power, we are still required to pay these fees. This significantly raises costs for more affordable products like small displays. Jesse recently shared this post with me, sparking memories of how absurd the situation was. UL's policy of charging based on value rather than cost led to outrageous fees, such as $20K for a simple paper change. To make matters worse, Red Lion even trespassed on our tradeshow booth and left their logo sign without permission. This led to me taking drastic action by shooting holes in the sign and leaving it at our office reception. The UL representative claimed to feel threatened by this act, showing an extreme sensitivity. Surprisingly, the situation escalated to the point where a senior UL VP visited me to discuss a new customer engagement strategy. However, when I tried to follow up with him, I was informed that he had been fired. It seems he did not fit in with the company's culture.</p>

            <p>I recently completed the UL 508a Motor Exam, and it requires either knowledge of the answers or knowing where to locate them. The exam consists of 80 questions to be completed in a four-hour time frame, with some tricky questions to consider.</p>

            <p>When it comes to safety standards for engineers in Europe, many often compare UL 508 and TUV. TUV is often seen as the European equivalent of UL508, focusing on safety measures for machinery. TUV requires engineers to pass a test with around 40-50 questions within a 2-hour time frame, with a passing rate of approximately 90%. This certification emphasizes safety protocols and the implementation of control measures to prevent accidents and ensure the protection of individuals working with machinery.</p>

While I feel confident in my understanding of 508a requirements, I struggled with the wording of certain questions. Throughout my 40-year career, the NEC has been central to my work, shaping my interpretation skills. Surprisingly, this background may have hindered rather than helped me in navigating the UL world.</p>

It took me nearly the entire 4-hour time limit, even though I was familiar with where to find most of the answers in the standard. Some of the questions were poorly worded, which made it even tougher. I suggest having a digital version of the standard and supplement SA on hand for quick reference during the exam. Best of luck to you!</p>

He advised me to postpone taking the test until he and other Field Engineers complete the Study Guide they are currently developing.

            <p>Dear sirs,

If you have taken the test, I have some inquiries: 

1. The online guidelines mention acceptable materials as a print or electronic version of the UL 508A standard, print materials from UL 508A training sessions, the National Electrical Code, and calculators. However, the UL email specifies that allowable materials include a print or electronic version of the UL 508A standard, print materials from UL 508A training sessions, access to UL.com, calculators, pens, pencils, and paper. The crucial question here is whether the NEC specifications are also required.

2. For those who have retaken the exam, was it the same test or a different one?

3. What is the test format like? Are questions presented one by one or all at once? Will you be informed immediately if your answers are correct or incorrect?

Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>1. Compliance with NEC code is not necessary. 2. It seems that the retest may differ from the initial test, as some test-takers have mentioned unfamiliar questions possibly from a test bank. 3. Questions are presented individually without immediate feedback on correctness. The test is divided into four sections, with a percentage of correct answers provided at the end of each section.</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been a surge in online tests, but unfortunately, a large number of them lack credibility. One particularly memorable example asked a question about the communication range of Modbus TCP/IP cabling, implying it could reach the moon. Surprisingly, the correct answer was not "to the moon," highlighting the lack of knowledge of the test creator regarding fiber optics and network switches.</p>

            <p>In a discussion, Chud pointed out that labeling the moon as the answer to a connectivity question was incorrect, as the exam creator may not be familiar with fiber or network switches. While a direct cable connection between Earth and the moon would pose logistical challenges, a more specific query about the distance for a single copper cable would be clearer. The term "cabling" is vague and can lead to confusion.</p>

            <p>I recently researched the requirements for getting a control panel listed by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) such as UL. It seems like a significant investment to ensure the safety and compliance of a custom control panel. Is it necessary to pay a substantial fee to have an NRTL certify that the panel meets safety standards and won't pose any risks? For UL certification, the process involves an annual fee of $10,000, passing a test on their standards, and paying around $5,000 for inspection and listing of the panel.</p>

            <p>I have taken the test twice now and unfortunately, I have not passed either time. The test is 4 hours long and consists of 80 questions. While I felt confident in the math, SCCR, and fusing questions, I struggled with navigating through the UL508a codebook to find matching phrases or interpret codes. My advice would be to take the test immediately after completing the course to ensure the material is fresh in your mind. Taking thorough notes and asking questions during the class, no matter how simple they may seem, is crucial. I am planning on taking the refresher online course and seeking clarification from UL experts on topics that were unclear to me. I hope this information proves helpful.</p>

Despite referencing the standards for clarification, I still struggled to understand why I did not pass. Some questions were confusingly worded and lacked essential information for a proper answer.

            <p>UL MTR Exam Success Story! I aced the exam with an impressive 90% overall score, proving that diligent preparation pays off. While the test was challenging, I made sure to thoroughly prepare to avoid any surprises. Here's how I did it:
- I diligently watched the UL training video and took detailed notes, capturing both the content on the slides and the key points from the presenter.
- In addition to the UL video, I also studied informative videos from Bussman, Siemens, and other relevant sources on topics like SCCR, Group Motor, and UL508A regulations, ensuring I had a well-rounded understanding.
- I meticulously compiled both paper and electronic versions of my notes, the standard guidelines, and Supplement SA for quick reference during the exam.
- I invested time in searching for specific phrases or keywords from the exam questions to better prepare.
- I made sure to approach the exam questions with caution, as the wording can sometimes be tricky and confusing.
- Contrary to my initial expectations, the exam was split into four 2-hour sections, which could be taken separately. I opted to tackle two sections on Saturday and the remaining two on Sunday, revisiting my notes for each section beforehand.
- My advice to fellow test-takers: take your time, read every question carefully, and best of luck on your exam preparation journey!</p>

            <p>It's amazing how time flies - I posted this thread a year ago and I finally made the leap to take the test. I passed on my first try with an impressive score of 93.75%. The training program I mentioned in a previous post really paid off. The deadline to have a certified MTR on staff is quickly approaching, so it was crucial for me to complete the test. I even found a unique way to take the test - in the car on my iPad, connected to my phone while my wife drove us back from visiting our daughter. It was a bit risky with the time limit and internet connection possibility, but fortunately, it all worked out in the end.</p>

            <p>I recently completed an exam with little time to prepare, and I nearly passed despite encountering tricky and unclear questions. One question, for instance, asked about the required panels for a "Short Circuit Control Rating" but included potentially confusing terms like "Control" and "circuit." Another question debated whether a panel with only one power circuit meets the criteria outlined in 508A standards. There were other debatable questions as well, where challenging them could possibly boost my score to over 80. Unfortunately, I didn't see an option to take the exam in parts; it had to be completed in one 4-hour session with no breaks allowed.</p>

            <p>Anthony406 raised a question about the test format, noting that most sources mention taking the test in a single 4-hour session without breaks. However, it is actually divided into 4 parts, each with a 2-hour time limit. Each part is a standalone module, requiring a minimum score of 80% to pass. Surprisingly, the parts can be taken non-consecutively and not necessarily on the same day. In fact, the test-taker completed part 4 before part 3. To maintain test integrity, participants must agree not to disclose details or record any part of the test. Despite this, some information may be shared (as in this case) without compromising test security. As of the latest update, the test is structured in 4 parts with individual time limits.</p>

The exam's guidelines require it to be completed in one 4-hour sitting, with the timer continuing to run between sections. There is no opportunity to pause for a break. However, if you registered before the new 4-part format was implemented, you can still opt to take the old 80-question format.
