                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>How to effectively develop maintenance employees and ensure they follow established procedures for preventive and routine corrective tasks poses a challenge in a growing organization. As a contract manager in a company renting plant maintenance to manufacturing plants, the task of expanding the organization to handle additional orders requires hiring and integrating new craftsmen into the company culture. While new employees may bring valuable skills, some may lack knowledge and professional approach. To address this, a comprehensive maintenance task library is being developed, with procedures discussed and agreed upon in regular meetings. Craftsmen are required to fully understand and take responsibility for implementing these procedures, fostering a sense of formal accountability. Additional meetings are held to enhance cooperation and communication, aiming to alleviate any reservations employees may have about the formal procedures. Balancing practical training and emotional engagement is crucial in ensuring the success of the maintenance team in the long term. Comments and suggestions on this approach are welcome.</p>

            <p>What procedures require signature approval from craftsmen? Our process follows ISO9000 standards, ensuring all tasks are signed off by those completing them. Non-compliance is easily traceable. Additionally, utilizing experienced craftsmen to train and mentor new hires will help the senior craftsmen take pride in their proteges. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Implementing a mere signature to confirm understanding and agreement with procedures does not guarantee compliance. Instead, administer tests to ensure comprehension and proficiency. Identify less proficient individuals and provide tailored programs to enhance their skills. By investing in training sessions customized to their needs, employees will appreciate the effort and feel a sense of pride. For instance, conducting rigging and hand-signaling training sessions with pre-tests and post-tests yielded positive results. Initially met with skepticism, employees eventually became eager to participate in future training sessions, actively seeking knowledge and sharing their experiences. This transformative process is facilitated by experienced trainers who effectively communicate with the workforce.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the insights shared, as they uplift my spirits. Josh, you are absolutely correct in pointing out that simply jotting down statements is not enough. I aim to steer clear of treating this process as a mere formality on paper. It would be ideal to have experienced craftsmen leading each group, but the challenge lies in the limited number of senior craftsmen available to oversee the growing number of new groups. It is crucial to maintain the trust and confidence of all customers, especially long-standing ones, during this period of growth.

Svanels, your valuable advice aligns perfectly with my goal of gaining their support. The majority of our training sessions are conducted in-house, focusing on plant-specific equipment maintenance and essential tasks like installing new belts. While outsourcing training is not financially viable, we have dedicated supervisors to oversee these sessions, with occasional involvement from myself to connect with the team on a personal level.

One of the key challenges I face is individuals who possess adequate knowledge but have a tendency to take shortcuts in their work. This behavior needs to be addressed promptly, but time is a constraint. I am considering implementing a system to publicly recognize employees who consistently deliver error-free work, though it may be challenging due to the absence of overtly negative behaviors.

I have also contemplated the idea of deploying traveling inspectors for surprise checks, but this approach could potentially offend our diligent employees. The pressing question remains: how can we instill a sense of reliability and accountability among our team members quickly?</p>

            <p>When children are unsupervised, they tend to take shortcuts. Our company conducts monthly site safety talks lasting about 30 minutes, which are mandatory unless a valid excuse is provided. Additionally, we hold weekly group safety talks known as toolbox meetings, which are linked to our incentive program. However, supervisors and foremen need to be reminded to conduct these meetings consistently. Even mechanics can lead safety talks, such as the one on firecracker safety held two months ago. Despite these efforts, it is common to find violations in the field, such as lack of harnesses or improper use of scaffolding. It is crucial to prioritize safety over reliability alone, as safety issues are prevalent in day-to-day activities. Training sessions are essential, and while costs may be a concern in the US, we offer day-long trainings and cover instructors' fees. To ensure effectiveness, we limit training sessions to 15 participants and collaborate with instructors to create a cohesive program. It is advisable to leave training to specialists, as expertise in a subject does not automatically translate to teaching ability. Investing in developing instructors can prevent losing valuable employees who seek additional responsibilities. Consider hiring instructors from vocational schools or other companies to provide cost-effective training solutions.</p>

            <p>Hello DC2, I appreciate your focus on fostering pride and building a strong culture within your organization. It's great that you recognize the importance of both skills and procedures in achieving this goal. While skills and procedures are more concrete aspects, pride and culture are more intangible but equally important elements. It's crucial to address both aspects separately to see real progress. 

To develop pride and culture, consider implementing strategies such as having workmen sign off on each job, restarting equipment in their presence, recognizing and rewarding workmen who produce quality work with minimal repeats, promoting teamwork over individual heroics, and encouraging participation in Root Cause Analysis studies. Prioritize quality over speed to show your commitment to nurturing pride within the organization. 

Cultivating a positive culture is a more complex task, but it starts with fostering pride among employees. Ownership, team spirit, and trust are key components of a strong culture. Managerial missteps can easily derail progress, so it's important to focus on leadership development as well. Encourage fairness in recognition and rewards, and prioritize building a cohesive team environment. 

The road to improving pride and culture may be challenging, but with dedication and the right strategies in place, success is achievable. Best of luck on your journey. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>I appreciate everyone's understanding of the balancing act required in my role - blending the intangible qualities of pride and professionalism with the practicalities of procedures and documentation. As our team continues to grow, we have implemented a structured process known as "follow our procedures" to onboard new employees. This game incentivizes employees with rewards for successfully completing the initial phase, while also encouraging those who need extra support to put in more effort. This approach has proven effective in instilling the importance of adhering to necessary formal procedures while ensuring overall satisfaction with our work.</p>

            <p>dc2, Another important point to consider is utilizing your CMMS as a tool to empower your team. Allow them to take on some of the detailed planning and scheduling tasks, such as acquiring parts and consumables, requesting cranes, and more. Instead of simply supervising them, encourage supervisors to support and guide their team members. Provide training for supervisors to become mentors, offering technical knowledge and expertise. Additionally, consider dedicating an hour or two each month for supervisors to brush up on their mathematical skills and learn how to analyze key performance indicators like MTBF, MTTR, and compliance. By involving them in the analytical process, they can see the impact of their work and feel a sense of pride and ownership. Encourage supervisors to investigate failures beyond surface level analysis. These investments in training and mentorship can lead to a more efficient and engaged team. Best of luck. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Allowing employees to have input in creating their own procedures can greatly improve operational efficiency. It is common knowledge that the real-world experience often differs from what is laid out in manuals or during training. Implementing strict procedures can lead to unnecessary hurdles, as issues may arise that were not accounted for. It is beneficial to gather feedback after procedures have been put into practice and make improvements accordingly. While taking shortcuts can be advantageous in increasing productivity, it is crucial to ensure that safety and compliance with regulations are not compromised. In conclusion, fostering a culture of innovation rather than stifling it is key to success in any organization.</p>

            <p>I have a strong aversion to the term 'shortcut.' It gives off the impression that certain steps in a process are being skipped. In the field of motor repair, this could mean important elements like insulation being overlooked or machine fits being hastily done. These shortcuts may help a motor get through its warranty period, but they ultimately have a negative impact on its reliability. On the other hand, continuous improvement or optimization involves making changes that enhance the overall procedure. By documenting these improvements, everyone can benefit from the revised process and avoid any potential issues. Without proper documentation, relying on shortcuts can lead to problems resurfacing once those who implemented them are no longer around. The success of implementing new processes largely depends on the existing culture within a facility, which is heavily influenced by its leadership.</p>

            <p>Bill, I share Howard's viewpoint on empowerment. When I referred to empowerment, I meant giving workers the authority to handle the entire job, not just the manual tasks. Writing procedures requires more than just knowledge of the current methods; it also needs someone with a comprehensive understanding of the process and the ability to foresee potential issues. It's important to have one standardized procedure for each task, written at a higher organizational level. When making changes to existing procedures, proper change control and risk analysis are essential to avoid serious incidents. While I understand your mention of 'short-cuts' may not have the same context as my comments, some readers might misinterpret it, so I am issuing a cautionary note. - V.Narayan</p>

            <p>I admit using inappropriate language in my previous statement. Although I may not be familiar with everyone's background, I have recently transitioned from a hands-on role to a management position. From my experience, implementing procedures can be challenging in real-world situations. It is crucial to adhere to all procedures diligently, but it is also important to address any obstacles that hinder productivity. Often, people tend to overlook issues once they have passed, resulting in inefficient or impossible steps being repeated. I am passionate about improving procedures for better outcomes and urge for all necessary steps to be included in the process.</p>

            <p>I found this post enlightening and I firmly believe that protocols are essential in a diverse skill environment. Taking pride in your work and ensuring tasks are completed satisfactorily are crucial elements. However, pride alone is not sufficient, just like procedural systems and guidelines are not effective unless individuals possess a strong desire for continuous learning and see challenges as opportunities instead of just tasks. In my opinion, pride is not a trait that can be taught; it either exists within a person or it does not. Therefore, the selection process should begin at the initial stages, rather than after training. I understand that others may disagree with my perspective, but that is how I perceive things. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts.</p>
