                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, I am a beginner in Codesys and currently delving into it for a project we are working on. The project involves controlling a portable rollformer specifically designed for roofing metal. We are in need of a PLC with a 7" HMI, but with a unique requirement from the client - they prefer non-touchscreen operation. This means all interactions on the screen must be done through buttons, function keys, a membrane keypad, or a similar mechanism. Finding an HMI that fits these criteria, functions at temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius, and is readable outdoors has proven to be quite challenging. The equipment will be installed in enclosed trailers, with the screen positioned just inside the trailer door for easy access by the operator. After thorough research, the IFM CR1074 seems to meet all our requirements.

My plan is to utilize the CR1074 solely as an HMI and have it communicate with a Do-More BRX PLC via either Modbus or Ethernet/IP. I have experience mapping variables into Modbus memory blocks on the PLC side, but I am unsure about configuring this setup in Codesys. Specifically, I need to establish Modbus addresses and potentially convert registers to 32-bit integers as necessary. Additionally, some variables will be editable on the screen (e.g., entering quantities for parts to cut and target lengths using a USB numeric keypad connected to the CR1974). These edited variables must be written back to the PLC.

Typically, traditional HMIs handle data conversion and Modbus writes automatically, but I am uncertain about how this process works in Codesys. I am seeking guidance on whether the CR1074 should act as the Modbus slave or Master, and how to configure it to display values from the PLC while allowing input of new values to be written back. Any assistance or insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it would be more efficient to develop the PLC program using Codesys, taking advantage of the HMI's runtime capabilities, and then incorporating another system for remote IO. This simplifies the process significantly. If you have already invested a lot of time in the BRX platform and are not keen on switching to Codesys, you can still integrate Modbus data into the Codesys device smoothly. This allows you the flexibility to apply various logic and manipulation functions within the Codesys environment. There are plenty of valuable resources available online for Codesys, so a quick search using relevant keywords can provide great insights. You can also check out tutorials from experts like Tohid Alizadeh and Jakob Sagatowski on YouTube, as well as consulting Codesys documentation for additional support (although the help files may be concise).</p>
