            <p>Dear Sir, I would like to share a quote from my previous article titled "Captured by Data." In the article, I discuss the concept of "maintenance," which refers to the regular activities necessary to uphold performance standards during the operational lifespan of an asset. When designing a maintenance policy, factors such as the operating environment, available resources, and the asset's ability to meet performance standards must be considered.

The term "critical failure" has evolved over time to encompass failures with high-impact consequences, rather than solely those affecting safety. In this paper, "critical failure" refers to any failure that causes the asset to perform below the required standard. To achieve maximum cost-effectiveness throughout an asset's lifespan, a focus on managing critical failures is essential, emphasizing reliability.

As a policy designer, the goal is to develop cost-effective asset management programs, implement routine activities, and make procedural and design changes to prevent critical failures or minimize their likelihood. This approach reflects the principles of modern Reliability-centered Maintenance (RCM). The attached article provides further insights on this topic. Please note that the email address mentioned in the article is no longer active.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. After reviewing your message, I believe I can incorporate the concept of RBM (reliability-based maintenance) into my work. To be honest, I am still unclear about the underlying idea behind this term. Perhaps after reading the attachment, things will become clearer. Thanks once again for your input.</p>

            <p>In order to effectively manage maintenance operations and minimize downtime, costs, and safety risks, it is crucial to prioritize the reliability of the asset. Whether you refer to this approach as "Susan" or by any other name, its focus on preventing critical failures is key to success.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that RCM was not actually named by Stanley Nowlan and Howard Heap. Here are the details: 

In 1965, a rudimentary decision diagram technique was developed, and in June 1967, a paper was presented on its use at the AIAA Commercial Aircraft Design and Operations Meeting. This decision diagram was initially used for the maintenance steering group on the Boeing 747 aircraft, leading to the creation of the document MSG-1. 

Subsequent improvements from the use of this decision diagram were incorporated into a second document, MSG2, two years later. MSG3 was then utilized to create scheduled maintenance programs for various military aircraft, including the Lockheed 1011, Douglas DC10, Lockheed S3 and P3, and McDonnell F4J. 

The term RCM, named after author John Moubray, distinguishes industry-based (RCM2) from the original airline industry-focused RCM developed by Nowlan and Heap. Moubray, a student of Nowlan, sought to create a decision diagram applicable to land-based industries. 

For those interested, RBM (Reliability-Based Maintenance) is related to Condition-Based or Predictive Maintenance. Hopefully, this information clarifies any confusion. Rolly Angeles, Reliability Consultant.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that N&S were the first to name the process RCM in their groundbreaking work on Reliability Centered Maintenance published in 1968 through the Dept. of Defense. While N&S led the RCM study, there were also collaborators in the Maintenance Steering Group (MSG). As the RCM process was being developed, airline manufacturers and users were implementing MSG. John Moubray played a key role in popularizing RCM and authored the widely acclaimed book RCM II.</p>

            <p>Dear colleagues, the Reliability-Centered Maintenance document originally requested by the Department of Defense in 1978 is now available for viewing. The introduction and table of contents have been included for your convenience. The full document (~30MB) can be downloaded from the Reliability section of ReliabilityWeb or from my website at http://www.motordiagnostics.com/presentations.htm.

John Moubray's book, Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM II), was released in 1992 as an improvement over Classical RCM. The concept of RCM was developed over three decades, with a significant milestone being a report commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in 1978. This report, completed by Stanley Nowlan and the late Howard Heap of United Airlines, detailed the development and application of RCM in the civil aviation industry.

Since the early 1980s, the author and his team have assisted numerous companies worldwide in implementing RCM in various industrial settings. This experience led to the evolution of RCM2 for non-aviation industries in 1990.

Howard

            <p>In my previous post, the attached introduction explains the rationale behind the use of the term "reliability-centered maintenance" in their own words. The term "Reliability-Based Maintenance" had been trademarked by a commercial entity, possibly CSI, prompting the adoption of the former term. - Howard</p>
