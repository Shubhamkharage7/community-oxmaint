            <p>While it may not be what you were looking for, this technical guide discusses the transition from ME to SE. Unfortunately, I currently do not have SE installed to experiment with. Ideally, there should be an export/import process to transfer graphics and tags between the two environments. Since they share a similar runtime environment, the differences lie in their feature sets.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to transfer graphics from RSView32 to RSView ME for use on a PVP, it may be a challenge. I remember attempting this about a year ago without success. I explored the option of moving the graphics to RSView SE first and then converting them, but it didn't seem feasible. Consider reaching out to a distributor specialist for further guidance on this issue.</p>

            <p>Converting RSViewSE graphics to RSView ME may not be a straightforward process, as Rockwell Automation has not provided a specific method for this. However, I successfully completed this conversion a year ago. To do so, follow these steps: 1. Open the RSView SE graphics file in a Hex editor. 2. Search for the term "SE" and replace it with "ME" (remember to input the hex code for "ME"). 3. Save the gfx file. 4. Finally, utilize the import graphics function within the display module. This process may require some trial and error, but it is achievable with the proper understanding of hex editing techniques.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Yes, it is possible to convert displays from SE to ME, but the process is more complex than you may think. We had to convert over 25 displays, with a main concern being complex drawings. To import correctly, you need to first export the SE file as an XML and open it in WordPad. Then, you must modify the first three header lines related to the version and display type. The easiest way to do this is to export a blank screen from ME and copy the top three lines of the XML to the SE version.

If errors occur during the import process, they will indicate which fields are invalid. Common fixes include removing tooltip="" and exposetoVB="<something>" using find and replace. Additionally, any buttons in SE will need to be deleted, and images with the transpose property should be removed. Editing the XML files and removing specific fields should resolve any remaining errors.

Hopefully, this information will be helpful to anyone facing similar challenges. Knowing these steps would have saved us a significant amount of time when converting our screens.</p>

            <p>An update on the conversion process: While Alphanodewrote is correct, there are additional steps to take in removing certain elements. After converting RSView32 to FactoryTalk View SE, the goal is to import as much as possible into FactoryTalk View ME, focusing on screens excluding buttons, numeric displays, numeric input, and touch animation. To do this, navigate to the SE application, right-click on "Displays," then select Import/Export to export them as XML files. You can choose which displays to export. Edit the files as instructed below and import them into ME using the same method as you exported them from SE. Additionally, perform a search/replace to remove elements like toolTipText="", exposeToVba="notExposed", <button name= to </button>, <numericDisplay name= to </numericDisplay> (usually 5 lines), <numericInput name= to </numericInput> (usually 5 lines), <animations> calling out <animatetouch to </animations (other animations are fine, excluding touch animation), and <stringdisplay> down to </stringdisplay>. Using a regular notepad editor is recommended, and if you encounter errors during the import process, the error message will specify the line number and position. Be cautious not to delete beyond the object being removed, as this could result in the error report pointing to the wrong line. Best of luck with the conversion!</p>

            <p>JLHARV commented that a customer initially chose RSView32 for their system due to data logging needs, but later wanted to switch to PanelView Plus to move away from PC-based operations. This decision led to concerns about maintaining a large number of stand-alone systems throughout the plant, as seen in a previous experience with a similar project involving over 100 SLCs and PanelViews. It is important to consider the scalability and long-term maintenance implications when transitioning between different control systems.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone! I found this thread to be quite helpful, so I decided to revive it and share my contribution. I have developed a VBA script in Excel that streamlines the process of adjusting SE XML export files to meet ME standards. While the script may not be perfect, I have conducted thorough testing and successfully used it for numerous conversions. Feel free to enhance the script (improve the interface, add batch support, etc.) and share it with others! I quickly put this together after realizing I should have used ME instead of SE for a large project.All testing was carried out in FTView 8.1. To access the code and see what the macro does, simply press Alt+F11 or navigate through the developer ribbon in Excel. Rest assured, there is no harmful code in this file; however, exercise caution when dealing with files containing macros as they can pose risks. The macro's functionality may be disabled upon initial opening.There might be extra XML tags or attributes present in SE projects that need to be eliminated for ME imports. If you come across any and are unsure about modifying the code to accommodate them, feel free to share your experience and I will update the file accordingly! Thank you!</p>

            <p>This tool, as mentioned by bstiffler582, has proven to be incredibly useful for editing SE XML export files to meet ME standards. Although the VBA script in Excel is not fully refined, it has been successfully tested on numerous conversions. Users are encouraged to enhance the script with better interface design, batch support, and other features. The tool was specifically tested in FTView 8.1 and requires changing the file extension from .xls to .xlsm. By accessing the code through Alt+F11 or the developer ribbon in Excel, users can see the macro in action. While the file contains no malicious code, caution should be exercised with macro-enabled files. It may be necessary to remove additional XML tags or attributes from SE projects for successful ME imports. Users are welcome to share their experiences and suggestions for further refinement of the tool. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>In a post by bstiffler582, he shared a valuable thread that inspired him to create a VBA script in Excel for automating the editing of SE XML export files to meet ME standards. While the script may still need some refinement, it has been tested successfully on numerous conversions. Users are encouraged to enhance it with features like a better interface and batch support. The process was tested on FTView 8.1. I find the XML import/export feature in FTView Studio quite useful, especially when combined with VBA scripting in Excel. I appreciate the effort put into this. I look forward to trying it out for SE to ME conversions and will provide feedback on any improvements that could be made.</p>

            <p>Fantastic job on this bstiffler582! I am thrilled to have stumbled upon this useful application, which has been a lifesaver in saving both time and stress by eliminating the need to recreate work from previous SE projects. After downloading your V1.0 file and customizing it for our SE V14 conversions, I noticed that boatshoes had released a V2.0 update. Upon reviewing the changes, I discovered that they either mirrored what we already had or were insignificant for our purposes. Nonetheless, I have consolidated all modifications and incorporated them into a new updated version (see attached). This update has been tested with SE v14. As before, remember to change the file extension from .xls to .xlsm.</p>

            <p>How Long Does Rockwell Take for SE to ME Conversion?
Turn AroundJaxGTO mentioned that with Rockwell support, you can submit an SE application and they will provide you with an ME application in return. They have successfully completed several conversions for me before. Regarding the time frame for a conversion like this, I have a rsview32 project that needs to be transformed into FTview SE and the screens transferred to ME. Instead of starting from scratch, I would prefer to make slight adjustments.</p>

            <p>ChrisOrban commended the excellent effort of bstiffler582 on this useful application. Discovering this handy tool has been a lifesaver, saving time and reducing the stress of recreating work from other SE projects. While initially using the V1.0 file and customizing it for SE V14 conversions, an update to V2.0 by boatshoes was noted. After reviewing the changes, it was found that most were already integrated or not relevant. The updates were consolidated into a new version for convenience (see attached). Compatibility has been tested with SE v14, but remember to change the file extension from .xls to .xlsm.As always, thank you for the valuable updates.However, some users may encounter issues, such as the persistence of linkToolTipText="false." This has been resolved in Version 2.2 (attached), where minor tweaks and corrections have been made. Similarly, remember to change the file extension from .xls to .xlsm. Notably, ensure that the "backColor" parameter is lowercase to avoid errors (e.g., "black" is correct, but "Black" will cause issues).</p>

            <p>Bstiffler582 shared: Hello everyone, I found this thread helpful and wanted to bump it up to contribute. I developed a VBA script in Excel to automate the editing of SE XML export files to meet ME standards. Although it's not perfect, I have successfully used it for numerous conversions. If anyone wants to enhance it (improve interface, batch support, etc.), feel free to do so and repost it. I quickly put this together after realizing a project should have been done in ME instead of SE.

All testing was conducted in FTView 8.1. Remember to change the file extension from .xls to .xlsm. To view the code and understand what the macro is doing, press Alt+F11 or access it through the developer ribbon in Excel. This file contains no harmful code, but be cautious of files with macros as they can pose risks; the functionality may be disabled upon opening. You may also need to remove additional XML tags or attributes from SE projects for ME imports. If you encounter any and feel unsure about modifying the code, share your experience and I will update the file accordingly. Thank you! Click to expand... Feel free to share it.</p>

            <p>It is puzzling that the web links appear to be missing. This is the most recent edition I possess. I uploaded v2.0, but upon checking our server, I discovered v2.1. The variations between the two are unclear; they likely only consist of minor adjustments if I overlooked updating. I trust this clarifies the situation.</p>
