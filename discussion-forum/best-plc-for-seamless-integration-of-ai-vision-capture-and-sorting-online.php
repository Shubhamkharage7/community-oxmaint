                    <p>I have experience working with AB Micrologix on small projects, but now we are looking to capture and process photos online, sorting based on variables. Which platform or PLC is best for seamless integration with web components? Currently, we are using a Raspberry PI for vision capture as a proof of concept, but we are interested in upgrading to a robust industrial system with proper cabinet, safety measures, and more. Automation Direct has suggested considering the Productivity1000, 2000, or 3000 lines. Seeking additional insights from the community. Thank you!</p>

            <p>In all honesty, I would steer clear of using a PLC altogether. Instead, consider investing in the ruggedized Nvidia Jetson products designed specifically for industrial applications. By utilizing these products, you can ensure that your R-Pi code remains applicable and communication with a Logix processor is seamless. Are you currently utilizing Python and OCV for your projects?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>We utilize Python and OpenCV for image capturing, annotations, and API processing. Can you recommend a Logix processor that easily communicates with a Jetson? Our main task involves processing images and controlling sensors and air valves, usually with 24VDC actuators.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering sensors and valves for your project, it's important to first identify what you are familiar with and what your budget looks like. Whether you're working with a few sensors or valves, there are various options available that can make the process easier and more efficient.

For instance, if you are comfortable working within the GPIO of a Raspberry Pi, you could consider using an industrialized Raspberry Pi along with interface relays to control your sensors and valves. On the other hand, if you require a PLC for future expansion or standardization purposes, there are Python libraries available that allow communication through Ethernet/IP, Profinet, Modbus TCP, sockets, or serial connections.

In our experience, we started with a Raspberry Pi and later upgraded to a Jetson Nano for our project involving Gig-E cameras and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for vision evaluation. We were able to easily send data to a CompactLogix PLC using libraries like pylogix or PyComm. These communication methods also work with Micro, Compact, and Control PLCs, providing a wide range of options within the Rockwell ecosystem.

            <p>Many modern PLCs have the capability to communicate with non-PLC systems seamlessly. However, in some cases, you may need to set up the communication protocol yourself if it is not supported by the brand. For example, a PoC can utilize an S7-1200 PLC, which comes equipped with an OPC UA server, a popular open industrial communication protocol. Additionally, the PLC offers support for open socket TCP communication and Siemens provides multiple libraries for communication utilizing this method. An example is LHTTP, which enables HTTP Get/Post/Put requests. Visit SIOS support on industry.siemens.com for more information.</p>

            <p>In order to ensure your components can meet production speed requirements, there are several key questions that need to be addressed. Firstly, what is the production rate with a 30% increase? Secondly, what is the resolution of the camera being utilized? Thirdly, what type of camera is being used? Fourthly, what interfaces are connecting the camera, PLC, PC, and network? And lastly, what is the speed of the interfaces? Answering these questions will determine if your setup is capable of meeting the necessary production speeds. - James</p>
