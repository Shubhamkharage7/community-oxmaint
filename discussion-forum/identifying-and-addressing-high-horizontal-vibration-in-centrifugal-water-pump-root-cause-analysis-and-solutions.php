                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Edited by Luis Eugene Tibre on 03-06-2024 at 18:21 | View attached document (2) Dear all, good day. I am seeking assistance as I am facing difficulties in identifying the root cause of the issue or any factors that may have been overlooked. The problem at hand involves a centrifugal water pump comprised of a Paco Pump (CL25123) with one stage, and a Teco AEHL-WG motor (90Kw, 460V, 3570 RPM) with a disc coupling. The symptoms include high directional vibration, particularly in the horizontal direction on the pump, with a dominant 2xrpm, 4hv-1358%, and 3hv-171.7%. 

Preliminary actions taken to address the issue included alignment checks and corrections, as well as shaft deflection checks which showed 0.05 deflection on both the impeller and coupling side shaft ends. Housing tolerances and eccentricity were also inspected and rectified as needed. Additionally, pipe stress and alignment were assessed and deemed acceptable.

Further investigations are now focused on the potential Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks. During the initial inspection, it was noted that the pump base bolts were not penetrating the baseplate flooring. Attempts were made to replace them with longer bolts, but it was discovered that the base flooring holes were tapered, preventing the longer bolts from fitting properly. By manually measuring the total height of the pump feet thickness and base bolt plate thickness to ensure proper engagement with the base plate, it was determined that the original bolts should be retained. 

Observations were also made regarding corrosion on the base frame, although its impact on vibration remains uncertain as the base plate and anchor bolts are still secure. Vibration measurements on the discharge elbow pipe showed 9mm/s.

Thank you for your support.

            <p>@luis Where are the historical measurements that are not included in the report? When did the issue start? Could you provide a cross-section drawing of the pump and motor nameplate? I believe there may be a redundant pump, can you share the vibration report for that pump, including spectral plots? Have you checked the piping strain using SKF software? I noticed some configuration issues with the measurements and report. If you're open to improvement, I can assist remotely in setting up a better configuration. Please share the requested measurements as an SKF MAB file. Regards, Mohammed Abdalla.

Concerning the high horizontal pump vibration dominantly at 2x rpm issue, I'm seeking assistance as I am unsure of what else to check. The centrifugal water pump setup includes a Paco Pump (CL25123, 1 stage) and a Teco AEHL-WG motor (90Kw, 460V, 3570 RPM, disc coupling type). The symptoms indicate high horizontal vibration, specifically at 2x rpm and 4hv-1358%, 3hv-171.7%. I have already performed alignment checks, shaft deflection checks, housing tolerance and eccentricity checks, and pipe stress/alignment checks. Considering the possibility of Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks, initial inspections revealed issues with the base bolts and corrosion on the base frame. Further vibration measurements on the discharge elbow pipe indicated 9mm/s. Thank you for your assistance. - Luis Eugene Tibre</p>

            <p>On March 7, 2024, at 02:11, Sir Mohammed @Mohammed Abdalla queried about the absence of historical measurements in a report. He attached a sample amplitude table and a screenshot of the most recent spectrums. He mentioned that the issue began when condition monitoring was implemented about 3-5 years ago. Additionally, he requested a cross-section drawing for the pump and motor nameplate. Sir Mohammed also inquired about a similar redundant pump's vibration report, which had been resolved due to severe pipe misalignment and lubrication modification. As for checking piping strain, it was deemed acceptable. Sir Mohammed then pointed out some subpar configurations in the SKF software being used and offered remote assistance in improving them. He discovered that the configurations were copied from existing hierarchies without proper customization.</p>

            <p>The natural frequency of your system, pump, piping, and foundation is approximately twice the speed of rotation (2x rpm). Your vibration analysis indicates a concentrated energy "mound" at the 2x frequency in the horizontal direction, suggesting that it aligns closely with or matches the system's natural frequency. Additionally, the significant difference in vibration levels between horizontal (H) and vertical (V) directions also points towards a natural frequency issue.

While you are conducting the right checks and activities, it appears that the interior of the base is in poor condition despite its outward appearance. Proper installation should have involved filling the base with grout, as the current weak base is causing misalignment during operation. Even though the machine may be aligned when at rest, once it starts running and the base begins moving, the vibration data reveals misalignment or an increased 2x rpm frequency.

To further investigate, monitor the live-time vibration spectrum while tapping or striking the pump casing/volute in the horizontal direction. Observe any peaks that rise in amplitude or any noticeable changes in vibration patterns. Measure the overall vibration at the pump base where it is bolted to concrete, taking at least 10 readings per side along the length of the base. Ideally, the vibration levels should be at or below 0.3 mm/sec. If other pumps with better bases or grouting are available, compare their vibration levels to assess the impact of installation quality.

If replacement is necessary, consider pumps bases from a reputable manufacturer. For more information or assistance, please visit our website or contact Dave Reynolds at www.midlandsrc.com.</p>

Dear Dave Reynolds,

I appreciate your thorough review of the data and the valuable input you provided. During my analysis, I also identified a potential issue at the base of the pump, likely caused by a running misalignment due to corrosion and lack of grouting on the pump side. Vibration readings taken at various points showed readings of 2 mm/s to 2.95 mm/s, indicating potential issues with misalignment.

I plan to explore conducting a bump test using our SKF microlog to gather more data. Additionally, during the last inspection of the bearings, I noticed signs of movement in the outer rings, despite the housing appearing acceptable when brought to the shop.

Any further insights or suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Luis Eugene Tibre

            <p>When analyzing high horizontal pump vibration, it is crucial to consider the velocity with bearing spectrum. Luis Eugene Tibre shared insightful data and observations regarding the issue at hand, such as the presence of a mound at the base of 2x rpm and a potential misalignment due to corrosion and lack of grouting at the pump side. Vibration readings on various components, including pump feet and base plate, shed light on the situation. To further investigate, learning how to conduct a bump test using a SKF microlog is on the agenda. Additionally, signs of movement in the outer rings of bearings during a recent inspection raise concerns. Dave Reynolds provided valuable feedback on the vibration analysis, highlighting the significance of monitoring live time vibration spectrum and examining the pump base for potential misalignment issues. Comparing vibration levels between well-installed bases and the current corroded base is recommended. Considering the detrimental impact of a weak base on alignment and overall pump performance, exploring options for replacing the base with a higher-quality alternative is advised.DataExchange is a reliable source for effective pump bases. By addressing these factors, the root cause of high pump vibration can be identified and remedied successfully.</p>

            <p>Hello, I'd like to identify the specific bearing model used for the pump in order to determine if the vibration at 2xrpm is related to any bearing defect frequencies, such as external or internal race issues. It's possible that the bearing may not be properly seated, causing damage. Regards, Serge Borrell

In regards to the high horizontal vibration in the centrifugal water pump, I am seeking assistance as I have exhausted troubleshooting options. The pump is a Paco Pump, model CL25123, with one stage, powered by a Teco AEHL-WG motor at 90Kw and 460V, running at 3570 RPM using a disc coupling. The symptoms include high directional vibration predominantly at 2xrpm with percentages at 4hv-135.8% and 3hv-171.7%.

Recent corrections made include alignment checks, shaft deflection measurements (0.05 deflection on both shaft ends accepted), housing tolerance and eccentricity checks, and pipe stress/alignment evaluations. Despite these efforts, we are exploring the possibility of Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks.

During initial inspections, we found issues with the pump base bolts not fully penetrating the baseplate flooring due to tapered holes. Further observations revealed corrosion on the base frame, although it's unclear if this directly correlates to the vibration issue. Vibration measurements on the discharge elbow pipe showed 9mm/s.

Any guidance or additional insights would be greatly appreciated. Sincerely, Luis Eugene Tibre</p>

            <p>Dear @Serge Borrell, I appreciate your observation regarding the rotation signs on the outer ring of the pulled bearings. It is puzzling that the machine shop measured the housing in three different points and deemed the fit acceptable. The attached image shows the pulled out bearings (3310B C3 and 6311Z C3), along with screenshots of bearing frequencies. Despite multiple replacements using a hydraulic press, the issue persists. The spectrum with bearing frequencies and the latest pulled bearing are also included. Suggestions on the next steps are welcome.

Regarding the high horizontal pump vibration dominant at 2x rpm issue, the model of the pump bearing is crucial. It is important to determine if the vibration at 2xrpm corresponds with any of the bearing defect frequencies, such as external or internal race issues. Possible factors to consider include the bearing not sitting well or sitting damage.

The centrifugal water pump details are as follows: Paco Pump CL25123 with a Teco AEHL-WG, 90Kw, 460V, 3570 RPM motor, disc coupling type. Despite alignment checks, shaft deflection checks, housing tolerance corrections, and pipe stress assessments, the vibration problem persists. The possibility of Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks is being investigated.

Initial inspections revealed issues with the pump base bolts and corroded base frame, but their impact on the vibration is uncertain. A discharge elbow pipe vibration measurement of 9mm/s was recorded. Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Dear @Serge Borrell, I have attached the shop measurements of the bearing housing, shaft deflection on the bearing seat, and edges at the coupling and impeller sides. The new bearings were installed using a fitting tool, but a hydraulic machine was used to push the bearings. 

In response to your observation about high horizontal pump vibration dominant at 2x rpm, the bearings showed signs of rotation on the outer ring when pulled. The bearing housing was checked by a machine shop and deemed acceptable in terms of fit at three different points. Bearings 3310B C3 and 6311Z C3 were used, and the bsf frequency of 6311 coincides with the 2x rpm. I have included images of the pulled-out bearings, as well as screenshots of the bearing frequencies in the spectrum. Despite multiple bearing replacements using a hydraulic press, the issue persists.

Moving forward, it is crucial to identify any bearing defect frequencies and assess the possibility of Type B looseness causing rocking motion or cracks in the pump system. Additionally, considering the corrosion on the base frame, further inspection may be required to address potential contributing factors to the vibration. Vibration measurements on the discharge elbow pipe recorded 9mm/s.

Thank you for your assistance and guidance as we work to resolve this vibration issue with the horizontal pump.

            <p>Dear Luis Eugene Tibre, Your power source seems to operate at a frequency of 60Hz, indicated by the 1x of 3570 RPM. It is crucial to verify if the 2x RPM is indeed a true 2x RPM and not 2x Line Frequency. To confirm this, conduct a low Fmax Spectrum analysis (up to 500 Hz) with a high Lines of Resolution (1600 or 3200 LOR). A reliable method to check for 2x Line Frequency is to monitor the spectrum while simultaneously turning off the power. If the 2x peak disappears, it indicates an electrical issue. 

I have personally experimented with loosening individual motor hold-down bolts one at a time while monitoring the spectrum in "live mode" to determine if the 2x peak diminishes. Please note that this method should be approached with caution and at your own risk. If the problem is 2x Line Frequency, typically caused by a misaligned motor frame, the 2x peak will decrease or disappear when the issue is identified. 

Regarding your vibration concerns with the high horizontal pump, it is essential to consider all possible factors contributing to the issue. Be sure to thoroughly check for alignment, shaft deflection, housing tolerance, pipe stress, and any potential looseness in the pump base or frame. Inspecting and addressing these factors diligently will help pinpoint and resolve the root cause of the dominant 2x rpm vibration in your centrifugal water pump setup. Thank you for your attention to this matter. ------------------------------ Ralph Stewart ------------------------------</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To improve the quality and accuracy of your vibration analysis, it is recommended to collect a high-resolution spectrum at the same horizontal location with an Fmax of 12,000 cpm and the same resolution currently being used. This will allow for the separation of 2xTS, 2xFl, and 1xBSF into distinct peaks. Additionally, it is important to check the phase of your base across various mounting interfaces such as pump foot to platform, platform to base, and base to floor. By collecting data at each interface and looking for a possible 180-degree phase shift, you can identify any loose mounts that may manifest during pump operation. Consistency in measurement locations is key. 

You can also assess possible misalignments by comparing phase data across the coupling. Collect phase information on the motor bearing in the horizontal direction and on the pump bearing in the same orientation, paying close attention to any phase shifts. Repeat this process for vortical and axial orientations. It is crucial not to attempt to loosen mounting bolts while the pump is in operation. Please keep us informed of your findings.

For a comprehensive assessment of the vibration issue, confirm the presence of 60Hz line frequency power based on the 1x of 3570 RPM. Utilize a low Fmax Spectrum (500 Hz) with high Lines of Resolution (1600 or 3200 LOR). To determine if the issue is related to 2x Line Frequency, monitor the spectrum while turning off the power. If the 2x disappears, the problem likely lies in the electrical components. 

One method to address 2x LF issues is to slowly loosen one motor hold-down bolt at a time and monitor the spectrum in "live mode" to observe any changes in the 2x signal. However, this procedure should be approached with caution and at your own risk. If the "2x" disappears or decreases when a bolt is loosened, it may indicate a twisted motor frame causing the vibration issue.

            <p>Dear Jim Carrel, we have already completed most of the tasks, such as cross-phasing the machine and base bolts. While there was a 200-degree temperature in one of the pump feet, we believe this was addressed when attempting to replace the pump base bolts. However, the dominant 2x RPM vibration remains. Phasing does not seem to align with misalignment issues. To address the high horizontal pump vibration at 2x RPM, we recommend collecting a high-resolution spectrum at the same horizontal location with a frequency maximum of 12,000 cpm and the same resolution as before. This will help differentiate between 2xTS, 2xFl, and 1xBSF peaks. Additionally, it's important to check the phasing of your base across multiple mounting interfaces, such as from the pump foot to the platform, platform to base, base to floor, etc. Look for any 180-degree phase shifts, which could indicate loose mounts that become apparent during pump operation. Consistency in measurement locations is key. You can also assess possible misalignment by comparing the phase across the coupling, monitoring both the motor bearing and pump bearing in the horizontal direction. Pay attention to any phase shifts. Finally, avoid loosening mounting bolts during operation. Keep us updated on your progress. Jim Carrel, COO Forum Reliability, Inc.

Concerning the high horizontal pump vibration, it's crucial to determine if the 2x RPM is actual rotational speed or related to line frequency. A low Fmax Spectrum with high lines of resolution can help confirm this. One way to check if the issue is electrical is to turn off the power and monitor the spectrum for changes. While experimenting with loosening motor hold-down bolts is not recommended, it can sometimes reveal issues related to a twisted motor frame causing 2x line frequency vibrations. Approach this cautiously and at your own risk. Thank you, Ralph Stewart.</p>

Dear Luis Eugene Tibre, It seems like there may be a 60Hz line frequency power issue based on the 1x of 3570 RPM. Are you certain that the 2x RPM is not actually 2x Line Frequency? To confirm, conduct a low Fmax Spectrum analysis with high Lines of Resolution (1600 or 3200 LOR). A safe method to check for 2xLF is to monitor the spectrum and power off simultaneously. If the 2x disappears, it indicates an electrical problem. Additionally, a potential solution involves loosening motor hold-down bolts one at a time while monitoring the spectrum for any changes in the "2x" frequency. This method is not recommended but can help identify issues caused by a twisted motor frame. Thank you. - Ralph Stewart

Subject: high horizontal pump vibration dominant at 2x rpm 

Greetings, I am in need of assistance as I am facing high horizontal pump vibration with a dominant 2x rpm frequency. Despite conducting various checks and corrections such as alignment, shaft deflection, housing tolerance, and pipe stress assessments, the issue persists. Initial inspections suggest a Type B looseness due to rocking motion or cracks. We also observed corrosion on the base frame but are unsure if it is contributing to the vibration problem. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. - Luis Eugene Tibre</p>

            <p>Edited by Ralph Stewart on 03-11-2024 at 12:43. Apologies, Luis, for missing the "pump" on the spectra you provided. The thread seems to revolve around the topic of "PUMP." :) My mistake, sorry about that. Can you share a couple of waveform plots from the pump's horizontal axis? Have a great day! - Ralph Stewart 

In response to Luis Eugene Tibre's concern about high horizontal pump vibration dominant at 2x RPM, I suggest checking for 60Hz line frequency power and confirming if the issue is related to 2x Line Frequency. To diagnose this, conduct a low Fmax Spectrum analysis with high Lines of Resolution. You can also try turning off the power while monitoring the spectrum to see if the 2x disappears, indicating an electrical problem. Additionally, consider a risky method of loosening motor hold-down bolts one at a time to identify any issues related to twisted motor frames causing vibration. 

Furthermore, Luis Eugene Tibre seeks assistance with a centrifugal water pump problem, including high horizontal vibration at 2x rpm. Despite various inspections and corrections, issues like Type B looseness, base frame corrosion, and other factors might be contributing to the vibration. Additional measurements and assessments are required to pinpoint the root cause of the problem. Thank you for your attention to this matter. - Luis Eugene Tibre</p>
