            <p>After updating the inverter's version, the alarm feature is now functioning correctly. This update has improved the inverter's performance and resolved any issues with the alarm system.</p>

            <p>I want to ensure I understand correctly. Initially, the system was functioning properly. However, as mentioned earlier, there was an update to the inverter. Am I correct in understanding this? Do you mean to say that the firmware of the inverter was updated or that the inverter itself was swapped out for a newer model? What exactly distinguishes the system before when it did not display any alerts and now? What has been altered? Since we lack familiarity with your setup, could you utilize MS Paint to illustrate the alarm you are referring to? I have viewed the image, but I am uncertain about what you are indicating by alarm. If possible, could you offer a bit more elaboration?</p>

            <p>Could this be a FactoryTalk View SE application? It does not seem to be a Machine Edition (ME) product in use. It is possible that your client license is not being recognized by the activation process. Despite this issue, your PLC is showing good communication. The alarm displayed is related to the activation status.</p>
