                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have some questions regarding tracking maintenance breakdowns in an automotive manufacturing factory that operates on three rotating shifts. Each shift consists of four individuals equipped with radios to communicate with maintenance when a machine malfunctions. Previously, we utilized Microsoft Access to record details such as the worker assigned to the repair, the actual downtime of the machine, time spent on the repair, parts used, and descriptions. With SAP's iw21 system, we can now easily document parts, descriptions, and equipment, but we are seeking a way to track specific individuals involved in the repairs. While we can search by the "Created by" field, how can we track individuals like Bob who may not be the ones filling out the reports? Additionally, I am looking to connect with companies near Toronto, Canada, who also use SAP for similar tracking purposes to potentially visit with my supervisor. Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When creating notifications, do you check the breakdown field to track tasks? Are operations used in work orders to assign specific tasks to individuals? If the report is completed by someone other than the person who performed the job, consider entering the craftsman's name in the operations section. If necessary, you can also add it to the long text field in operations as a temporary solution. Do you receive technical support from SAP Plant Maintenance for resolving technical issues like this?</p>

            <p>Hello MAPMAINTENANCE, at our organization, we utilize SAP's IW21 for handling malfunction reports with a configuration (M2) specific to a custom notification type N1. Equipment is categorized based on equipment class, simplifying the process of coding failures through catalog profiles. This system also captures details such as who reported the breakdown, repair duration (useful for Mean Time To Repair statistics), and automatically generates a ZBRK work order type that is promptly released. This allows technicians to add necessary parts to the work order, create a picklist, and easily retrieve parts from storage. Additionally, technicians can record their time and perform goods movements (GI) using IW41. However, extracting this information effectively poses a challenge. It is essential to identify lagging indicators to validate data accuracy, such as ensuring all technicians allocate 100% of their time to work orders. Monitoring MTTR of breakdowns and analyzing hours worked by work type (corrective, preventive, unplanned/emergencies) is crucial. While standard SAP training may not provide this level of insight, CRL training could be beneficial. To optimize data management, we enlisted the assistance of a consultant from Utopia to streamline our master data structure for easier breakdown coding. Adhering to disciplined practices and consistently validating data remains key to success.</p>
