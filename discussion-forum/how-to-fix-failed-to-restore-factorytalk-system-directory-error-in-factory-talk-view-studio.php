                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone,

When attempting to open Factory Talk View Studio, I encountered the following error message: "Failed to restore the archived version of the FactoryTalk System Directory. Please refer to the help documentation or contact your System Administrator for assistance with restoring the archived FactoryTalk System Directory." 

I have attempted to resolve this issue by uninstalling and reinstalling the software, but unfortunately, it did not solve the problem. Any assistance with resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. It appears that someone else used my computer last week, and upon returning to it today, I encountered this persistent problem that I cannot seem to fix.

Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I wanted to share a solution I found for a common issue that may be helpful to others. I encountered a problem with an ME station that was not closed properly by tech support. They advised me to delete a specific folder located at C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\RSView Enterprise\ME\Runtime. The folder I deleted was named CurrentSysBak, or a similar variation of a current system backup folder. After deleting this folder and rebooting, the issue was resolved and everything started working correctly. This simple fix can help anyone experiencing similar issues with ME stations not closing properly.</p>

            <p>Quick Solution: I resolved the issue by deleting the backup file in the runtime folder without needing to restart anything. Simply opening Factory Talk after deleting the file allowed it to work perfectly. This problem occurred when I attempted to open an MER file directly from my desktop instead of using the Factory Talk list, resulting in an error message stating it was unable to open. It seems that I can only access files from within the Factory Talk directory. The reason behind this limitation is unclear.</p>

If you are experiencing difficulties finding the specific folder mentioned earlier, I managed to locate it on my personal computer at this destination: C:\Users\Public\Documents\RSView Enterprise\ME\Runtime.

            <p>Stormcloak expressed gratitude to dhuber for the simple solution and all others for their useful responses. In case anyone is struggling to find the folder using the provided path, it can be found on their PC at C:\Users\Public\Documents\RSView Enterprise\ME\Runtime. By deleting the backup folder in that location, the issue was resolved without the need to restart the system. Appreciation for the assistance!</p>

            <p>No need for a restart in this case. Although the file pathway was different for me, searching the C: drive for the folder did the job. Thank you. This trick can be helpful when searching for files on different drives.</p>
