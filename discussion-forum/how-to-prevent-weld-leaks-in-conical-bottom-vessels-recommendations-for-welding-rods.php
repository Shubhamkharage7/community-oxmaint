                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In my facility, I have noticed a recurring issue with weld leaks in the conical bottom vessels, particularly at the junction where the cone meets the boot. These vessels store slurry and are constantly in use as holding tanks, being pumped 24/7 with a turnaround cycle of 130 days. One potential root cause identified is the change in flow direction within the tank, leading to turbulence and erosion at the weld site. I am seeking recommendations for a welding rod specifically designed for these types of welds. Will using a stronger, more suitable rod help alleviate this problem and prevent future leaks?</p>

            <p>Absolutely, there is a specialized hard-facing rod designed specifically for wear-resistant applications on 'A' series steel. Is it possible to incorporate additional metal during the welding process? And has a vortex breaker been considered to mitigate swirling effects?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Are you experiencing wear, erosion, or cracks in the weld? Is the weld leaking consistently around the circumference or just in patches? Are you wondering if TK refers to tank? What is the thickness of the tank's plate material, and is it constructed of carbon steel? Additionally, what type of electrode are you currently utilizing?</p>

            <p>The plate is 1/2 inch thick with a weld that has eroded approximately 2.5 inches long by 1/8 inch wide. TK refers to tank, and the current electrodes being used are regular mild steel electrodes, such as the commonly used 6010. The weld encircles the boot's circumference, and one potential solution being considered is using a nickel electrode for a stronger weld.</p>
