                    <p>This morning started off with a major setback when I discovered that my virtual machines on my remote ESXi server had been compromised by hackers who likely gained access through RDP due to weak passwords.

            <p>It is important to stay vigilant, as ransomware can lie dormant for long periods before being triggered. This was a lesson learned by one of my previous clients, whose backups were also compromised due to the delay in detection. It is crucial to have a reliable backup strategy in place to protect against such threats.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I concur with Ken's perspective that everything must be treated as suspect now. It is crucial to conduct a thorough wipe and rebuild of any systems that the virtual machines (VMs) could have potentially touched on the network. There should be no reliance on saved data or backups in this situation. If the VMs were not accessible via the internet, it is likely that the intrusion occurred through another entry point. It is imperative to prioritize security measures in light of this breach.</p>

            <p>How much ransom are they asking for? I wouldn't consider paying as my time is valuable, but it's always an option. In the past, I was the go-to person for recovering computers from ransomware attacks for friends and family. However, it's been a while and the tools and methods have changed, so I may not be up to date. The first step in dealing with ransomware is to identify the specific type you are dealing with. Search for "how to identify ransomware" to find useful information.

If you are fortunate, there may be a decryption tool available for free. Be cautious of purchasing decryption tools from unknown sources. In the past, I used Avast for cleaning infected computers due to its efficient boot time scan feature. However, it has been some time since I last used it.

At this point, it's important to treat everything on the infected machine as suspect. Even after cleaning it up, there may still be hidden threats like backdoors or keyloggers. Personally, I would recommend starting fresh and not taking any risks.

Moving forward, consider using a password manager like Keepass to enhance your online security. It's a reliable tool that can help you manage passwords securely. Remember to start fresh on any new, clean devices to ensure your safety online.</p>

            <p>How can I verify this? The first thing I did this morning was to check if the VMs had rebooted, and I noticed that some of the files now have a .hazard12 extension. I then checked Windows update and saw that there was a Windows 10 update on the 30th. This morning, I was able to create "fresh" backups from InTouch, and it seems that the Rockwell *.ACD files were not affected. I scanned them with Defender, but I am unsure if it is safe to move them without causing any damage.</p>

            <p>To ensure a quick and seamless recovery process, I utilize virtual machines (VMs) to easily revert back to a functioning configuration. Once I have a VM set up to my liking, I close it and make a duplicate in a designated "VM_Archives" folder on a separate hard drive. Currently, this folder contains 42 well-maintained VMs. In cases where the VM is for a single-drive remote machine, I create a separate partition specifically for backing up the VM.

Having these backups readily available has proven invaluable in situations where issues arise within a VM, such as suspected viruses or failed Windows updates. One instance I recall involved downloading an infected PDF from the official Panasonic website when setting up my first Panasonic PLC. Thankfully, I had all necessary files backed up on a network drive, allowing for a swift restoration process that took just half an hour.</p>

            <p>This morning, I purchased additional HD storage to increase capacity on the server. When using DDNS between our primary and secondary homes, I encountered a security issue with the secondary house desktop being accessed without a password. Thankfully, I only lost time as all my music and videos were backed up on an external drive. It was the lone infected device in the household; the other desktops and laptops with Windows passwords were unaffected. It is crucial to use strong passwords for all devices to prevent such incidents. Unfortunately, I do not have backups for the VMs and will need to spend significant time transferring data to the ESXi server, reinstalling software, activating licenses, and setting it up all over again. Lesson learned - I will ensure better security measures in the future to avoid disappointing my boss.</p>

            <p>Robertmee mentioned that none of his virtual machines (VMs) are able to connect to the internet. In order to activate licenses, he opts for offline activation or temporarily enables internet access. Robertmee's VMs are located on a remote ESXi server 50 km away from his home office, where he accesses them via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This setup was put in place to address security concerns, as his boss was uncomfortable with valuable Rockwell stock being stored at home with his children present. Typically, Robertmee only enables internet access on his VMs for essential tasks such as updating Windows or activating licenses with the firewall disabled. As someone who is not well-versed in IT, Robertmee is seeking a solution to access his VMs through RDP without needing to enable internet connectivity on his Windows 10 machine. Despite the remote setup being efficient with 20 cores and 128 GB of RAM allocated for three VMs, security remains a top priority due to potential security threats.</p>

            <p>Robertmee inquired about the suspected means of entry, which was determined to be RDP with brute force password cracking. All three VMs had the same password, making them vulnerable to such attacks. The likelihood of downloading infected files onto all three VMs simultaneously was slim, pointing to RDP as the point of entry. This scenario serves as a reminder of the importance of password protection, as neglecting to secure Windows sessions can lead to security breaches.</p>

            <p>Create a secure "tunnel" between your machines by installing OpenVPN Server on the remote machine and OpenVPN client on your home machine. This will establish a secure connection via VPN, allowing you to access the remote machine's desktop using RDP. Enhance security by setting up a security certificate that only authorized machines can use to connect to the VPN server. Keep the certificate on your home machine to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
