                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Dear Colleagues, I am currently employed in the oil and gas industry and our company has established a goal for Product Availability (Processing ability) for its stakeholders. This goal is derived from achieving a Plant operational Reliability of 99.1% and Availability of 94%, taking into account past experiences of failures and inspection interventions. It is crucial that we meet this target. 

Upon further analysis, this operational target is dependent on the reliability and availability of various sub-units, all the way down to the individual components within those sub-units. The management has set these targets based on demand and supply, but factors such as machine aging, life cycle, repetitive inspection interventions (specifically for gas turbines), and degradation of other components may pose challenges in achieving the target.

We aim to establish a benchmark for the expected reliability of the turbines, based on past and present system and component reliability data. This will allow us to determine if the Plant reliability and availability targets are reasonable. I am seeking best practices and benchmarking procedures within the industry for units such as turbines, pumps, and compressors, categorized by power output (1 MW, 5 MW, 10 MW). Your suggestions and insights on this matter are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>In order to achieve optimal results, aiming for 100% availability and reliability should be your target. Your current numbers of 99.1% and 94% seem inadequate to me. To reach these goals, it is crucial to have highly skilled personnel who are trained in top-notch maintenance techniques and procedures. Without this key element, your Predictive Maintenance (PdM) program will not be successful. Starting with a strong lubrication program is essential, then moving on to training and implementing PdM technologies. It is important for your supervisors to understand that without the proper resources, their demands cannot be met. This is just my perspective on the matter.</p>

            <p>In the realm of mathematics and practicality, achieving 100% reliability is nearly impossible outside of the initial installation of a new or fully reconditioned item. Over time, all items experience a decline in reliability which can be partially regained through regular maintenance. While availability can come close to 100%, the costs associated with improving it by just a few percentage points can be significant and tend to increase exponentially. Therefore, it is more feasible to set realistic expectations at a slightly lower level. This is why Jap's inquiry is valid and worth considering in terms of economics and practicality.</p>

            <p>Achieving 100% plant reliability and availability is achievable with the right equipment redundancy and maintenance practices. Mr. Vee emphasized the importance of having all equipment in top condition to meet reliability targets. In oil and gas processing plants, redundancy is essential for most equipment, although major components like the Main compressor may not have redundancy due to cost and reliability concerns. Despite regular maintenance, achieving 100% reliability has been a challenge, prompting a search for practical average reliability and availability factors based on industry best practices. Seeking guidance on setting up these standards and accessing relevant articles, Mr. Aromatics Thailand requested input from Mr. Vee. It's understood that equipment reliability benchmarks may vary depending on factors like expected lifetimes, operational considerations, and scheduled shutdowns.</p>

            <p>When starting a new project, it is crucial to first assess the design specifications to determine the expected reliability and availability of the plant. It is important to note that we should not go beyond the design levels unless we can modify the initial design assumptions. To enhance reliability, a key strategy is to systematically address and eliminate failures. A great starting point is to ensure that all equipment is properly maintained by keeping it clean, dry, and well lubricated, as moisture in oil can lead to unnecessary breakdowns. Additionally, regular checks on the tightness of bolts and the alignment and balancing of rotating machinery are essential steps that can lead to significant improvements.

Operational strategies such as duty/standby protocols, smooth loading processes, and consistent operating conditions all play a role in enhancing reliability. By following the vendor's recommended procedures for startup, operation, and shutdown, and refining maintenance programs through techniques like RCM, RBI, and IPF, you can further mitigate risks of failure.

Availability is closely tied to the duration and frequency of shutdowns. Effective planning, scheduling, and preparation for maintenance work can help minimize downtime. While it may be frustrating to deal with limitations on installed spare parts, focusing on improving spare availability and logistics support can help reduce overall downtime.

Benchmarking can be useful in identifying areas for improvement and best practices. However, the primary focus should be on achieving high system effectiveness, which is a more holistic measure than simple availability. It may take time and effort to reach this level of performance, but the payoff in terms of efficiency and reduced downtime will be significant.</p>

            <p>When it comes to equipment redundancy, achieving 100% reliability remains a myth. While redundant systems do improve reliability, they do not guarantee perfection. The availability of parallel systems is calculated using a formula involving failure rates and time. For multiple redundancies in identical systems, a specific formula can be applied based on the number of parallel systems in place. I delve deeper into this topic in the iPresentation titled "Reliability-Centered Motor Management", which can be found at (insert website link).

Approaching 100% availability is a commendable goal, but as Vee rightly points out, the closer you get to it, the more costs tend to skyrocket without proportional returns. For example, Dofasco Steel managed to achieve 96% availability relatively easily, but going beyond that point led to exponentially increasing costs with diminishing benefits.

To maintain optimal production planning and plant efficiency, it is crucial to understand the actual availability and capacity of the plant. This capacity will naturally decrease over time due to aging equipment and reliability issues, which can be mitigated through effective maintenance strategies.

Instead of trying to tackle all issues at once, it is advisable to step back, analyze the situation comprehensively, and prioritize areas with the highest impact. Taking on too much at once can lead to failure. Therefore, a strategic and systematic approach is key to improving reliability and overall plant performance.incerely, Howard</p>

            <p>In the field of Oil and Gas (O&G), the concept of System Effectiveness is commonly used. It is analogous to the concept of Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) in the Manufacturing Industry. System Effectiveness is more comprehensive than just looking at uptime; it takes into account volume as well. The metrics that your Management is likely interested in are related to System Effectiveness rather than mere Availability. Achieving high System Effectiveness is more challenging than simply maintaining uptime. When discussing System Effectiveness, are you referring to the system's capability to achieve a specific throughput within a certain timeframe? Could you provide an example of how this is calculated for a refinery or a pipeline? Thank you, Kim Williams.</p>

            <p>Kim, let's begin by discussing the importance of the Upstream sector in the oil and gas industry. In this sector, there are certain limitations in the Production System Capability, related to the Reservoir, Well, and Riser. This capacity, which we'll refer to as X barrels per month, can vary due to various factors. The Plant itself may encounter bottlenecks such as trips, shutdowns, and reliability issues, limiting its processing capability to Y barrels in a given period. The System Effectiveness can be calculated as Y/X. 

When it comes to pipelines, like major transport lines, optimal conditions can allow them to transport P barrels or standard cubic feet per second (scfs). However, the actual volume, say Q barrels or scfs, is often lower due to various reasons. The System Effectiveness is then determined by Q/P. 

A refinery with unlimited supply and demand can process a specific volume of crude, for instance M barrels. However, the actual volume processed may be affected by issues like plant reliability, storage constraints, and product disposal. Let's say the actual processed volume is N barrels. The System Effectiveness here is N/M. 

It's important to note that while time-availability is crucial, the System Effectiveness ultimately drives profitability. In the oil and gas sector, Availability is typically understood as System Effectiveness.</p>

            <p>What time frame did you consider for these calculations, Vee? Let's consider a scenario where a refinery has a nameplate capacity of processing 100,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Despite its unadvertised maximum demonstrated rate being 105,000 barrels per day, the monthly plan rate remains at 90,000 barrels per day. Now, a process upset on the second day of the month forces a reduction in processing rate to 80,000 barrels per day for the next 5 days. This results in a loss of 100,000 barrels based on the nameplate capacity and 50,000 barrels based on the monthly plan. Despite having a higher maximum demonstrated rate, operations resume at 105,000 barrels per day for the following 10 days to catch up to the monthly plan rate. If no further interruptions occur, the total planned volume based on a rate of 90,000 barrels per day will be achieved. What is the System Efficiency in this scenario? Do you consider makeup capacity or calculate losses daily? Thank you, Kim Williams.</p>

            <p>When considering time periods for revenue generation, it is important to tailor your approach based on the specific circumstances. For instance, if you are supplying gas to a Power Plant or gas grid, contracts may operate on a 24-hour basis, with a day serving as the unit of time. On the other hand, if your Company reports quarterly P&L statements to the NYSE, a quarter would be the relevant time period. Refineries typically utilize a year as the time period for calculating metrics like System Effectiveness.

To determine System Effectiveness, planned and unplanned maintenance downtime barrels are deducted over a two-year period, annualized, and then adjusted to match the Turnaround cycle time. This calculation helps identify the total annualized 'lost barrels,' which is then subtracted from the annual capacity to derive the System Effectiveness metric. Availability metrics are crucial for revenue generation, with Management focusing on maximizing revenue while Maintenance managers and Reliability Engineers concentrate on 'Time Availability.'

It is essential to manage the 'time-availability' of individual items, as the availability of protective and detective systems directly impacts Safety and Environmental performance. However, some managers may prioritize performance indicators over actual performance to maintain a positive image, rather than increasing revenue. Refineries should regularly assess their operational capabilities and adjust nameplate capacities accordingly, considering factors like downtime, logistics, and equipment reliability to ensure sustainable operation and prevent revenue loss.

Collaboration between maintenance planners and production schedulers is crucial for effective production scheduling, ensuring that any downtime is strategically managed within the scheduling window to avoid revenue loss. Additionally, maintaining the reliability of individual equipment is vital to prevent process upsets that could result in significant revenue losses and dissatisfaction among shareholders.</p>
