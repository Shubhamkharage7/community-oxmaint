                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, we are in the process of configuring an Aveva Plant SCADA node to link it with a Wonderware Historian node. I have been researching online and it seems that the Citect SCADA Wonderware Historian Connector is required to facilitate data storage from a Citect node to a Historian node. However, now that Citect SCADA is part of the Aveva family, I am unsure if the Historian Connector is still necessary or if it is compatible with this setup. Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The Citect SCADA Wonderware Historian Connector offers a more efficient way to set up the Historian compared to manual configuration. However, one drawback is that if the Plant SCADA system goes offline, so does the Historian data. An alternative approach is to connect the IO device directly to the Historian using an IOServer to OPC protocol converter or software gateway. This eliminates the dependency on the SCADA system for data transmission.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Do I still need the Historian Connector for integrating Aveva Plant SCADA with Wonderware Historian since Citect SCADA is now part of the Aveva family?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While the Historian Connector was traditionally required for linking Citect SCADA with Wonderware Historian, with Citect now being part of the Aveva family, it's worth exploring if the Connector is still necessary or compatible with this setup.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Is the integration process different now that Citect SCADA is part of the Aveva family?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The integration process may have changed with the acquisition of Citect by Aveva. It's recommended to check for any updated procedures or compatibility considerations in integrating Aveva Plant SCADA with Wonderware Historian.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Are there any new features or tools available for data storage and integration between Aveva Plant SCADA and Wonderware Historian post the merger with Citect?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Following the merger of Citect with Aveva, there might be new features or tools available for data storage and integration between Aveva Plant SCADA and Wonderware Historian. It's advisable to explore any advancements that could streamline the integration process.</p>
