                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>There are many companies online offering HMI and industrial electronics repair services. I am seeking recommendations for reputable companies that have produced successful repair results. My 15" PanelView Plus is experiencing touchscreen issues, with no response to touch. However, I am able to use a USB mouse to navigate the system. The repair quote from my Rockwell distributor is a steep $5500, exceeding the initial purchase price from two years ago. I am exploring alternative repair options at this time.</p>

            <p>Global Electronic Services, based in Georgia, has consistently delivered exceptional results for me. They offer expedited services if needed and have successfully repaired everything I've sent them, including items deemed unrepairable by other local shops. Additionally, they claim to have a partnership with Rockwell for their repairs, with experience fixing PanelView's and SLC & CLX CPU's. While it may sound like sales talk, their track record speaks for itself.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback. I have received positive recommendations about GES, including from my local panel shop that has previously utilized their services. However, I found it strange when I asked for a price estimate based on the symptoms I described, and was told it would be 50-60% of the cost of a new unit. In my opinion, pricing should be determined by the actual time and materials used, rather than the cost of a new unit. When I raised this concern, the representative mentioned the possibility of special A/B pricing and indicated flexibility in working with me. It appears that their pricing strategy is more focused on market demand rather than true cost.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to pricing, I always negotiate with repair shops to find a fair price. I recently experienced a similar situation at a marina, where the estimate for fixing a boat motor did not include any electrical work for a no-spark issue. Despite the high cost of a new motor, I was able to negotiate a repair price that was more reasonable. This experience reminded me of a local repair shop that once charged $125 to fix a Sola Silver Line power supply, which was much cheaper to purchase new. I questioned their methods and suspected they may have simply swapped covers instead of truly repairing the item.</p>

            <p>There are several factors that can impact the cost of repairs. Low-cost items like PSU's may end up costing more to repair due to the time and effort required for diagnosis and repair. In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to purchase a new unit instead. 

Obsolete equipment can also lead to higher repair costs, as there may be limited options available for replacement parts. Some repair companies, especially those affiliated with OEMs, may push for new purchases or upgrades instead of repairs.

I had a positive experience with a repair company in the past, but after they were acquired by the original manufacturer, the cost of repairs skyrocketed. In some cases, like with a Siemens HMI unit, the cost of repair or replacement was significantly higher than the original purchase price. In such situations, finding alternative sources for replacement parts can help save money and extend the life of the equipment.</p>
