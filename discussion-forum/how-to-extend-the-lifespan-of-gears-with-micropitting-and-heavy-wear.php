                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>One of our mill's transmission gearboxes is experiencing micropitting and heavy wear, indicated by high iron particulates found in the oil analysis. Unfortunately, we currently do not have the budget for a new set of gears. However, we are exploring alternative options to prolong the lifespan of the gears. At last year's Reliability Show, we came across a new metal treatment that can be applied on-site to restore the surface of gears, though the name escapes me at the moment. Any recommendations on how to address this issue would be greatly valued.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Don, for the referral. Carlos is currently helping us address the micropitting issue. Since last year's trade show, we have seen significant advancements in various industries and applications. Visit our website at rewitec.us to see some of the results. In today's tough economic times, we are providing a solution for wear problems through a surface treatment that can enhance the load carrying capacity and prolong the lifespan of gears for many years. This treatment can be applied while the machine is in operation, minimizing downtime and improving surface properties such as wear resistance, abrasion resistance, oxidation resistance, wetability, adhesion, and fatigue strength. Would you like to improve the performance of your mechanical equipment by restoring worn metal surfaces, allowing them to handle higher loads, speeds, and temperatures? Let's discuss the potential benefits at the upcoming forum.</p>

            <p>Hey there, I have limited knowledge on this topic, but I am pretty sure that it is not a metal spray. Based on what I recall, this product is added to the lubricating oil and circulated through the system. It works to coat the gears during operation. Although I have not personally tried it yet, the website showcases some examples of its results. Is anyone in this forum familiar with this product?</p>
