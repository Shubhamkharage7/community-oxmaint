                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Before diving in, I must mention that I have some experience with the Horner XL4 system. I have successfully implemented the BACnet IP and MS/TP protocols from Horner by configuring an XL4 for BACnet IP and conducting a successful test on our LAN. By simply setting up an IP/Subnet/Gateway address and using the "Yabe" program, I was able to verify the functionality. However, I am facing a challenge with the MS/TP protocol. Although I have configured it for the MJ2 serial port on the XL4, I am unsure how to perform a test to confirm its operation. My understanding of BACnet is somewhat limited, and I have been making efforts to gain more knowledge on the subject. Is there anyone who could provide guidance on setting up a test for an XL4 with a BACnet MS/TP connection to a PC without the need for expensive equipment? I do have a basic COM port available on my PC. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>jrobinson mentioned that they are familiar with the Horner XL4 and successfully configured it for BACnet IP connectivity by downloading the protocols and assigning it an IP address. However, they are unsure about testing the MS/TP protocol on the XL4. Their overall knowledge of BACnet is limited and they are seeking advice on how to test the XL4 with a BACnet MS/TP connection to a PC without investing in unnecessary equipment. They have a basic COM port on their PC and would appreciate any tips or suggestions. Can anyone help? Additionally, they would like to know how jrobinson set up and tested the XL4 with YABE, as they are encountering difficulties with it.</p>
