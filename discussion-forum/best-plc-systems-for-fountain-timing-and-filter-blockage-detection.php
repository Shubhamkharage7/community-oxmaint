                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently seeking a smaller and more basic PLC system for controlling the timing of a fountain, as well as an analog pressure sensor to detect any blockages in the filter lines of a large outdoor water feature. Additionally, I am wondering whether a drop in pressure or an increase in amp draw would be more effective in safeguarding the pumps from damage caused by clogged filters.

Recently, a group of individuals added foil confetti and Champagne corks into the fountain, leading to the pumps becoming clogged and running continuously until the next day. I am aware that Schneider offers cost-effective PLC solutions such as the Zelio Logic with complimentary programming software. Are there any other reputable competitors in the market that provide reliable alternatives for this application? I am specifically looking for options that are not cheap Chinese imitations.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, having redundancy to monitor both amp draw and flow is crucial in protecting your motor and pump. For instance, if your pump bearing starts to deteriorate, a flow switch may not immediately detect the issue, resulting in a delay in sensing low or no flow, whereas monitoring the amp draw can quickly detect spikes indicating a potential problem with the bearing. This dual monitoring system ensures early detection of issues to prevent damage.</p>

            <p>Clogged filters can decrease amp draw significantly by reducing the amount of work done per unit time. This is because with a clogged filter, the volume (V) drops close to zero even though the pressure difference (âˆ†P) increases.</p>

            <p>I incorporated a current switch to monitor a blower on a plastic grinder. In the event the regrind bin becomes full, causing material to clog the pipe, the plastic within the grinder continues to grind until it reaches a melting point. This scenario can lead to significant downtime for cleaning. By detecting a drop in current within the blower motor, I was able to prevent potential overheating before it happened. Consider utilizing two current switches, with one dedicated to detecting issues like clogged filters or faulty bearings by sensing either a drop or rise in current. This proactive approach can help avoid costly downtime and equipment damage.</p>

Looking to protect your pumps? Consider using a by-pass valve as a solution. Monitor the pressure levels and if they reach a certain point, trigger a warning light and open the by-pass valve to release the water. This can prevent damage caused by clogged filters. Alternatively, you could also shut off the pump to prevent any further damage. 

Instead of using a PLC, you could opt for a simpler solution like a pressure switch connected to the pump starter. By using the NC on the switch, you can easily stop the pump when needed. Additionally, the NO on the switch can be used to activate a warning lamp to alert you of any issues. While PLCs can be a fun and versatile option, sometimes a simpler solution may be more cost-effective and efficient. For more automation supplies and PLC tools, visit www.plccable.com.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the helpful responses! I am curious about the level of sensitivity required for a "reduced amp draw" to trigger a safety shutdown. I am interested in utilizing amperage switches for this purpose, but I want to avoid errors where the system shuts down unnecessarily or fails to detect a reduced load due to blockage. Can anyone recommend specific amperage switches that are well-suited for this application? Your insights and recommendations would be much appreciated.</p>

The PLC can be programmed in any language of your choice, making it versatile and user-friendly. Consider using a bypass valve to address pressure concerns, such as activating a warning lamp and opening the valve to redirect water flow when necessary. Running a pressure switch to the pump starter may be a cost-effective alternative to using a PLC, allowing for pump control and indicator lights without the need for additional programming. While PLCs can be a fun and powerful tool, they may be unnecessary for certain applications. Consider incorporating timers to automate pump operations and control lights, while utilizing indicator lights to monitor system status. Ultimately, the decision to use a PLC should be based on the specific needs of the system being designed.</p>

            <p>drbitboy mentioned an interesting point about how a clogged filter can reduce the amp draw in a system. This is because less work is being done per unit time, where work is calculated as the change in pressure multiplied by volume. A clogged filter can cause the volume to drop near to zero even though the pressure change increases. Thank you for the clarification!</p>

There are numerous options on the market, but an adjustable pressure switch could be the most suitable, especially if dealing with dirty outdoor water. Adding a tee in the line, a pressure gauge, and monitoring the operating pressure can help in selecting the right switch. Additionally, using a PLC for on/off functions and lights can be a great solution. Feel free to share a link if possible for more information on flow switches commonly used in pool or fountain systems.</p>

            <p>MikeyN recently purchased a lite version of a product from GIT, as they are not currently focused on wireless capabilities. The product is expected to arrive in a few days, and MikeyN is eager to see how sketches can be utilized with other programming languages. Although Arduino Cloud is available for IoT integration, there is curiosity regarding the ease of setting it up with Ignition Maker Edition. The Sketch operates on a separate page under the Project tab, allowing for programming in standard languages. By selecting the Sketch editor under resources, users can explore its functionalities. Additionally, a helpful video tutorial offers an introduction to programming the Arduino OPTA. Thank you for the valuable information!</p>

            <p>Ken Moore explained how to utilize 0-10V analog with a 500ohm resistor to still be compatible with 4-20mA devices. Adjustments for the 2-10 volt input need to be made through scaling. Are there any recommended resources, such as YouTube videos, that delve deeper into this topic? Thank you, Joe.</p>

            <p>To easily convert a 4-20mA signal to a 0-10V signal for analog inputs, all you need to do is connect a 500 ohm resistor in parallel with the signal across the analog input and ground. Check out this guide on converting a 4-20mA to 0-10V signal for Arduino boards in industrial settings. Learn how to program a 4-20mA sensor on an Arduino using a current loop sensor board.

            <p>While using the AB Micro 820 with CCW free software, I encountered a problem with the convertible discrete/analog inputs not working as expected. Despite trying to use the first convertible input as analog (4-20mA) on two Micro820 and one Micro970, the internal value remained fixed at 4095 and did not change, regardless of the physical mA value. The input status light for that channel even turned on. Despite following all connection diagrams, reading documentation, and seeking support from Rockwell, the suggested solution was to invest in the 2080-IF4 module. This raises the question of why additional expenses should be required for a controller that is supposed to have this functionality.</p>
