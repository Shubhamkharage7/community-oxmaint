                    <p>Hello, I am interested in enhancing my skills in PLC's and VFD drives to expand my expertise in the field. Both Mitsubishi FX3U and Siemens 1200 are commonly used at my workplace. I have heard that Siemens offers high-quality training courses, such as TIA-SERV, which I am considering.

            <p>dav555 inquired about laptop/tablet recommendations for working on PLC's. When referring to a 'laptop', are you looking for one to run TIA Portal for coding and development? I personally use a standard HP EliteBook for this purpose. Unfortunately, I cannot provide course suggestions as my knowledge of TIA Portal was self-taught through online videos and assistance from this helpful community.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Thank you for the suggestion! I agree that having a dedicated tablet for programming, fault-finding, and diagnosing software for Siemens, Mitsubishi, etc., would be ideal for its portability. I also noticed that Siemens offers a variety of online courses which I will look into. Thank you for your advice.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>dav555 mentioned the importance of having a tablet for programming, fault-finding, diagnosing, and running software like Siemens and Mitsubishi. A dedicated tablet for these tasks would make it easier to carry around. Siemens offers online courses that could be a good starting point for learning. However, most PLC software is designed for Windows, restricting your options to tablet PCs, which are not ideal for the PLC environment. To learn more, check out YouTube resources for TIAPortal, with creators like Liam Bee providing helpful content. Keep searching for more resources to enhance your skills in PLC programming.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to running various software packages, using a tablet may result in a subpar experience due to hardware limitations. Juggling incompatible programs simultaneously can be frustrating, making it essential to have a device with built-in Ethernet capabilities or ample USB ports for expansion. To avoid software conflicts and crashes, consider utilizing virtualization on a powerful PC equipped with a spacious SSD and plenty of RAM.

While I cannot vouch for Siemens classes covering Portal, my experience with their lower-level Simatic Manager courses for maintenance staff was beneficial yet costly. Limited alternatives were available at the time, leading me to self-teach on Portal. This steep learning curve, as Mas01 mentioned, was indeed a challenging initiation. Despite my expertise in Simatic Manager, transitioning to Portal after four years proved to be a significant learning curve.</p>
