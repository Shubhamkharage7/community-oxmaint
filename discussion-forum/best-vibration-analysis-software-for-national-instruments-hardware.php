            <p>Hello, I understand the frustration you are facing with the discontinuation of eZTOMAS and the Zonic book by NI after acquiring IOTech. This move has not served the machinery analysis community well. Despite this setback, I have managed to keep my three Zonic books operational using legacy software. I did explore alternative options such as OROS and Dewesoft, but they may not be compatible if you are already using NI data acquisition. Unfortunately, I can only empathize with your frustration. 

As you mentioned, the NI hardware, specifically the cDAQ Chassis with NI9234 and NI9232 data acquisition cards, works well for troubleshooting projects. However, finding compatible analysis software has been a challenge. The Alta Solutions software seems promising, but it requires their hardware to function. Customer support from National Instruments has also been disappointing.

You may want to consider exploring NI's LabVIEW-based software, although it may seem complex based on YouTube videos. Additionally, with NI's recent acquisition by Emerson, the future of their products remains uncertain. If you are looking for software that can work with your NI hardware for vibration analysis and data collection, it seems like there is a gap in the market that needs to be addressed.

I hope this information helps you in your search for suitable analysis software for your NI hardware. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need assistance. Thank you.

            <p>Edited by Kristan Sears on August 18, 2023, at 08:30. Kyle, I have extensive experience in this area and can provide you with several options depending on your end goal. If you are looking for a quick and user-friendly solution, I recommend DASYLab from Measurement Computing, which is ideal for data acquisition with NI hardware. Make sure to have NI MAX installed to configure tasks for the device using MAX before loading the NI modules into DASYLab. While LabVIEW can be challenging for beginners due to its graphical programming, DASYLab offers a more straightforward approach with minimal limitations. However, for real-time data with multiple channels, consider using Alta Solutions hardware.

For more advanced users willing to invest time in learning, ME'scope from Vibrant is a versatile option with a wide range of tools and capabilities. It works well with NI-9232 or 9234 for impact testing but may require some effort to configure initially. If you prefer a customizable solution and have programming skills, consider using Mathworks (Matlab) for building high-end custom applications.

To get started, I recommend trying out the 28-day trial version of DASYLab to see if it meets your requirements. Feel free to explore other software options that are compatible with NI hardware and offer the functionality you need for vibration analysis. Do not hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance or recommendations.

            <p>Edited by Kristan Sears on 08-18-2023 at 13:37. Kyle, I urge you to exercise caution when using the Flexlogger software. While it may seem impressive, I have encountered issues with similar products in the past. The demonstration videos can be misleading, as they may require additional add-on packages like DIADEM for full functionality, which can add to expenses. The software may only display basic data parameters like amplitude and speed, lacking more advanced features such as phase analysis. This limitation can be problematic for certain applications, as I experienced with DASYLab. It is essential to thoroughly understand your data requirements before committing to a software solution. Additionally, consider exploring alternatives like PicoScope for quick data analysis with a portable digital oscilloscope. Before making a decision, thoroughly evaluate the software's compatibility with your NI hardware and the specific analysis needs of your projects.</p>

            <p>Kyle, I appreciate your insights on the importance of phase, speed, Bentley Rack Vibration, and subsequent shaft orbits when considering new software options. It seems that the current software you are using struggles with reading tachometer or speed data from a keyphasor, and can be inconsistent in preserving spectral data based on the phase reference location. Upon further review, DIAdem seems like a necessary addition after watching YouTube videos. The initial affordability of DIAdem may raise some red flags, but it could provide the functionality you need. Thank you for sharing this information; I will definitely explore the suggestions you have provided. Best Regards, KB.</p>

            <p>Hey Kyle, I can relate to your struggles. With 47 years of experience in my career, I've worked with a variety of manufacturers' products such as Nicolet Scientific, Zonic, CSI, Entek, IOTech, and finally NI with LabVIEW. I taught myself LabVIEW programming, and I implemented a system to gather data from an electric motor with six axes in our repair shop. The data acquisition was quick, precise, and securely saved on the company's server located 800 miles away. The system was designed with the test stand operators in mind to ensure ease of use without dealing with technicalities like FMax, FMin, resolution, etc. I set up the system to handle a wide frequency range of 0-5000 Hz with high resolution for rotor bar analysis. Additionally, I included a tachometer channel and programmed LabVIEW to provide specific values needed for balancing software like Steve Young's program. This system has been in operation since 2005 and has proven to be an ideal solution for our needs. LabVIEW is not a simple language to learn; however, mastering it can lead to great results. When it comes to modal/ODS analysis on vertical pump systems, it's essential to address issues like Reed Frequency and excitation sources. In my experience, minor differences in runout can trigger vibrations at natural frequencies, which can be mitigated through precise balancing techniques. For hardware/software solutions, DataView Systems in Rochester, NY, offers expertise in integrating NI/LabVIEW systems. They can develop customized LabVIEW code for data acquisition suitable for analysis programs like ME Scope. Feel free to contact me if you want to explore this option further.

            <p>When it comes to NI hardware, I recently discovered the Sigview website, which is specifically designed for NI hardware. While I typically use VTI hardware, Sigview seems to be a powerful tool that I have yet to try. For my custom work, I made the switch from Matlab to Julia, which has been a positive move overall. Julia, being open-source with a wide range of packages available, offers a better programming experience compared to Matlab. In cases where Sigview's base package falls short, you can create custom algorithms in Julia seamlessly. We have developed numerous custom algorithms for tasks such as tach processing, signal processing, and predictive maintenance in Julia, and have found it to be a fantastic environment. Although I haven't come across a Julia package for writing universal files like in Matlab, Python offers such a package that can easily be integrated with Julia. The supportive Julia community is also a great resource when you encounter challenges. If you're involved in modal analysis, check out Xmodal from the Structural Dynamics Research Laboratory at UC for advanced modal analysis software. Additionally, the ME'scope software from Vibrant is worth considering for vibration analysis with NI-9234 modules. Both tools offer powerful capabilities that enhance the functionality of NI hardware in data collection and analysis. Overall, exploring these software options can help optimize your experience with National Instruments hardware.</p>

If you're using NI hardware, here's a suggestion for you. I recently came across the Sigview website, specifically designed for NI hardware. While I personally use VTI hardware, Sigview seems to offer robust functionalities. My transition from Matlab to Julia for custom work has been incredibly positive, although I do miss some Matlab features. Julia's open-source nature and extensive package library make it a preferred choice. With Sigview, you can even create custom algorithms using Julia, seamlessly integrating them with the software. The Julia community is supportive, providing assistance when needed. For modal analysis, consider checking out Xmodal from the SDRL lab at UC, which I found to be a cost-effective and advanced solution. 

Thanks to Kristan for the suggestion! ME'scope from Vibrant is another option worth exploring, especially for NI-9234 modules. Although there is a learning curve, once mastered, it offers powerful and functional features, ideal for field data collection. 

In search of analysis software for National Instruments hardware, I came across a few options. While the Labview-based software from NI seems intense, there may be other alternatives worth considering. Our current software, though effective for Modal/ODS analysis, lacks support and is plagued with bugs, especially in data collection. Any recommendations or insights on software compatibility with NI hardware would be greatly appreciated. With recent news of NI's acquisition by Emerson, the future remains uncertain. Your assistance would be invaluable. Thank you in advance! Kyle Bowlin</p>
