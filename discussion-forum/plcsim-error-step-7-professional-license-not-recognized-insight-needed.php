            <p>STEP7 Basic only includes S7-1200 PLCs and BASIC HMI's. It is unclear if it includes PLCSIM for S7-1200. Mas01 expressed confusion as the ALM indicates "STEP 7 Basic", while the TIA Portal shows "STEP 7 Professional" under Installed Software. TIA enables users to install the complete package, verifying licenses when accessing PLCs, HMIs, or software packages. Recently, when attempting to use a Unified Panel, TIA notified me of a lack of proper licensing.</p>

            <p>2 responses: 
1) Nowadays, it is not possible to solely install Step 7 Basic. The installation disc bundles Step 7 Basic, Professional, various WinCC options, safety programming, etc. However, PLC sim is available on a separate disc for reasons unknown.
2) Upon analyzing the original screenshot, I noticed what appears to be a simulated 1200, a simulated 1500, and another simulated 1200. From my understanding, Step 7 Basic allows for simulating 1200s (as seen in your license), while simulating 1500s necessitates the Professional license, as indicated by the error message. Adjust simulation 2 to a 1200 model, and you should be all set to proceed.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>mk42 noted: 2 comments on installing Step 7 Basic. Nowadays, it's no longer possible to install just Step 7 Basic separately. The installation disc now includes not only Step 7 Basic but also Step 7 Professional, various WinCC options, safety programming, and more. However, PLC sim is on a separate disc for some reason. Additionally, in the original screenshot, there appear to be simulated 1200 and 1500 models. It is understood that simulating 1200s is possible with a Step 7 Basic license, while simulating 1500s requires the Professional license. To resolve an error, swapping simulation 2 to a 1200 should solve the issue.

Cheers for this insight! Could it be that the middle instance resembles a simulated 1500? The circled icon seems to match the 1500 icon in the right-hand margin. I'm still unsure how to delete instances - can you assist me with that? Thank you.</p>
