                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I recently encountered an issue with my new Modicon M241 where the firmware was outdated upon opening. After updating the firmware to version 5.084 using the controller assistant in Machine Expert, the device started prompting for a login and password even though I did not activate any protection or user management settings in the application. I searched through the help files and tried using "Everyone" with a blank password, as well as "Administrator" with no password, but had no success. Following online instructions, I attempted to reset the device to its factory image by loading the firmware onto an SD card and rebooting the device. However, the original test program I created still remains and cannot be erased. Any assistance on finding the default user and password that may be missing from the latest help file would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Firmware Issue with M241 Controller

We appreciate your post, and we hope you had a wonderful start to 2021. It has come to our attention that the Schneider Electric website offers a firmware version for the M241 controller that is four times more advanced than the current one. Despite this, the EcoStructure Expert program has deemed this firmware outdated. Through the controller assistant, I was able to successfully load the M241 firmware version 5x onto the SD card as per the instructions provided in their help files. The process of reflashing the controller with the new firmware was smooth, as indicated by the status LEDs on the controller, in line with the instructions provided. 

However, despite these efforts, the old test program remains on the controller. Additionally, a login pop-up appears on my laptop, even though no such account was created by me as I am the sole user of this application. This issue seems to be a bug that needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, due to the holiday, contacting Schneider Electric for assistance has proven to be a challenge.</p>

            <p>I am currently utilizing SoMachine 4.3 and have not yet made the switch to EcoStruxure Machine Expert. A few years back, I encountered a similar issue with vanilla Codesys, but managed to resolve it by disabling User Management within the Codesys IDE. I do not believe the problem is related to the firmware. You can try deleting the application from the PLC. For more information, you can refer to this helpful video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tfm0y_Bwis) and the Codesys documentation on User Management (https://help.codesys.com/webapp/_cd...ermanagement;product=codesys;version=3.5.14.0).</p>

            <p>Schneider Electric has provided an important update this morning regarding the new Modicon Firmware update "5.0.84" for M241 class controllers. This update now includes mandatory security measures to enhance device protection. The default username and password for initial login are both "Administrator." After the first login, users are prompted to change their password to ensure better security. Despite this information being present in their extensive help file, it may be challenging to locate using their search tools. To address this issue, we recommended that Schneider include a label or quick start guide in the new hardware package to guide users through the login process. By implementing this suggestion, we hope to reduce the number of support calls related to password issues. Wishing you all a Happy New Year and hoping to save you from the frustration of navigating through this process in the future.</p>
