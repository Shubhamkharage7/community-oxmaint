            <p>The key to achieving your goals depends on your priorities. If you want to enhance operational reliability, minimize downtime, or reduce costs, you need to identify and address the root causes of these issues. On the other hand, if you are focusing on overall business performance, it is essential to assess the risk associated with various operational events.

When it comes to operational events, such as maintenance and downtime costs, analyzing potential and actual expenses is crucial for determining operational risk. For safety-related concerns, like detecting hidden failures in equipment like fire pumps or relief valves, it is important to have a robust testing and maintenance scheme in place to ensure technical integrity.

Monitoring compliance with testing and maintenance schedules for critical systems is also vital in preventing potential issues. If you identify any underperforming areas, improving work quality can lead to significant improvements across the board. Prioritizing safety-critical tasks followed by production-related tasks is recommended, although sometimes, situations may not align with this ideal sequence. It is essential to address issues promptly to ensure optimal performance and safety.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Vee, for your feedback. When calculating bad actors, is there a specific timeframe to consider, such as one year? Is there a monetary threshold to determine what constitutes a bad actor? For example, can we classify maintenance costs exceeding $100,000 USD as bad actors? Additionally, if a piece of equipment fails ten times per year without significant impacts on production or maintenance losses, should it be categorized as a bad actor? Conversely, if a critical piece of equipment fails once per year and negatively affects production and maintenance, is it considered a bad actor or simply a failure? Is there a distinction between failures and bad actors in this context?</p>

            <p>Hello, if I may address your questions in context. Here are my responses: 

When calculating bad actors, it is advisable to look at a time frame that provides representative data. A range of 6 months to 2 years should suffice. There is no specific monetary limit when considering bad actors - it varies from company to company. What may be significant for one firm might not be important for another. It is essential to identify the worst performers, regardless of the monetary value.

In terms of equipment failures, only focus on those that have a negative impact on production or maintenance. If a failure does not affect safety or cost you anything, it may not be worth addressing. Bad actor analysis helps prioritize efforts towards reducing failures that have economic or safety implications.

It is important to differentiate between generic failures and bad actors when conducting analysis. Determine what aspect of your operations you want to improve and focus on that. Whether it is reliability, cost-effectiveness, downtime, or any other objective, set clear goals for your analysis.

Remember, the ultimate objective of bad actor analysis is to improve specific aspects of your operations based on your objectives and priorities. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions. Regards, V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>When looking at long-term costs, pump failures can often end up costing more than a one-time large fire incident. This raises the question of whether pump failures should be prioritized as the primary issue to address.</p>

            <p>quote: Josh, what do you think about the long-term impact of chronic pump failures versus a one-time large fire incident that can be spread out over time? Should we prioritize addressing pump failures as the main issue? 

Dear Josh, When using a risk matrix, it is easy to compare frequent pump failures with a single major incident. Ranking annualized costs for both scenarios will show the same results. However, not annualizing costs is a common mistake. Only the more experienced analysts, like yourself, seem to recognize the importance of annualizing. Both methods will provide accurate results.

I regret to inform you that the risk matrix is not discussed in my current book. However, it is likely to be included in my upcoming book, which is currently in the planning stages. In the meantime, I will be delving into the topic of risk matrix during my workshop titled "Value Added Maintenance: Lowering Costs, Increasing Profits" scheduled for June 15-16 in Kuala Lumpur. 

Although the specifics are still being ironed out, if this piques your interest, feel free to reach out to me directly for more information.

            <p>Hello Alaa,

I strongly advise against getting caught up in the negative performance cycles of "bad actors". Throughout my 15 years of experience working with reliability improvement programs, I have encountered numerous companies that are aware of their issues. While their assessments may not always be accurate, they at least have a starting point for improvement. Waiting for problems to arise before taking action is a reactive approach to management, which is not conducive to effective asset management in the future.

It is more beneficial to address machine maintenance proactively by anticipating potential failures and implementing strategies to manage them effectively.

            <p>Daryl, it seems like you're suggesting that bad-actor analysis may not be necessary or effective. Are you implying that companies experiencing various reliability issues, from chronic to occasional but costly ones, should skip reactive root cause analyses (RCAs) in favor of proactive reliability-centered maintenance (RCM)? Is being proactive always superior to being reactive? Is preventive maintenance always preferable to breakdown maintenance, which is reactive in nature? It's clear that you value being proactive based on your thoughts on the standby situation, but it appears you have reservations about purely reactive actions. To provide clarity for readers, could you explain the reasoning behind your recommendations? Thank you. Regards, V.Narayan.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Hello Vee, I want to express my gratitude for your thoughtful communication. Your approach is truly gentlemanly. I believe that focusing solely on "bad actors" is a misinterpretation of the effectiveness of probabilistic risk analysis. It is often used by some consultants for business purposes rather than genuinely adding value to their clients. This should not reflect negatively on you in any way. When companies consider improving reliability, they may not necessarily be in a state of poor performance. Many companies are taking a proactive approach to managing their physical assets, although this is not always the case. Therefore, it is essential to start by understanding where to begin and how to address these issues effectively. This initial process should not take more than 2 hours. Even in industries with significant capital investments, I have yet to meet an asset management director who is unaware of their greatest pain points. Taking action based on poor performance does not always require a comprehensive and costly analysis; it simply requires action to drive change. It is common sense that action is necessary for change to occur. 

Regarding the choice between reactive RCA and proactive RCM, it is essential to be pragmatic. If a company is implementing reliability initiatives in response to existing issues, then utilizing problem resolution techniques such as RCA may be appropriate. However, in some cases, RCM could also be considered reactive when responding to current conditions. Proactive measures are undoubtedly preferable to reactive ones, as I have observed in large corporations over the past decade. Managing physical assets in a way that addresses issues before they escalate into performance problems is key to my proposals. 

The debate between preventive and breakdown maintenance is a longstanding one, with the former considered proactive and the latter reactive. It is not productive to delve into this discussion here. Outdated notions like "more maintenance equals greater availability" or "higher routine maintenance costs mean reduced risk" can be detrimental to companies that still adhere to these beliefs. 

In summary, conducting a full-scale "bad actors" or criticality analysis is rarely necessary and can be inefficient in assessing asset risk. Most organizations are aware of their reliability challenges and generally know where these issues lie. Prioritizing these challenges can be done swiftly without the need for extensive analytical procedures. Prioritization is only the first step in launching a reliability program. Emphasizing a proactive approach to managing assets is crucial for ensuring maximum reliability at a minimal cost, especially considering the strategic benefits and legal changes impacting companies globally. It is common practice in large, capital-intensive organizations to prioritize proactive asset management for optimum reliability.
