            <p>While some may not consider it ideal, there are instances where this feature greatly enhances code readability. Picture a scenario where 16 MOV instructions need to be executed - if neatly organized into 4 rungs of four instructions each, they can all be easily viewed on a single screen. However, if spread out across 16 rungs, it becomes cumbersome to navigate through multiple pages.

This is why I believe there is merit in utilizing this feature. That being said, I discourage creating a convoluted mess of code with numerous branches and scattered outputs just for the sake of efficiency. Unfortunately, some programmers take pleasure in crafting code that shocks and surprises, perhaps for the amusement of future developers who come across it. While it may provide a moment of intrigue, the long-term impact on code maintainability and readability should not be overlooked.</p>

            <p>I heavily rely on PLC programming software for my projects. I have grown frustrated with using RSLogix500 due to its limitations in allowing complex structures. It is crucial to remember that PLC programming is about creating instructions, not drawing electrical diagrams. Trying to visualize ladder logic as a circuit diagram can make it more difficult to solve problems efficiently. By understanding how instructions are executed, you can write code that is more readable and compact. This approach, demonstrated by Paul's example involving MOV instructions, improves code efficiency. I prefer to have a comprehensive overview of the logic in my programs rather than scrolling through excessive amounts of code. By optimizing the layout and condensing logic onto a single row, you can increase the amount of information that can be easily processed at a glance.</p>

Timbert raised the question: What are people's general sentiments towards this practice? Personally, I find it distasteful. Am I the only one feeling this way?

            <p>While some RLL programming packages may mistakenly consider a data move instruction as an output, it is important to prioritize maintaining standards over resistance to change. Finding a balance between adhering to standards and promoting innovation requires compromising to ensure overall efficiency and effectiveness in programming.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>27-09-2024</span></li>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the world of RLL programming, the concept of a data move instruction being classified as an output has been a point of contention. Some argue that it falls into the same category as instructions that write values into memory or registers. For instance, an OTE instruction writes either a 0 or a 1 into boolean memory, while a MOV instruction transfers the value of one memory/register into another. Despite the distinction, both operations essentially involve writing values. 

The debate over whether these instructions are considered outputs ultimately boils down to how "output" is defined. Some argue that both OTE and MOV instructions can be considered outputs due to their writing nature, while others believe otherwise. However, the core function remains the same - writing values into memory/registers.

When it comes to resistance to change in programming standards, the key issue is finding a balance between adhering to established norms and embracing innovation. Some resist change out of a desire to maintain standards, while others fear deviating from familiar practices. Nevertheless, progress should not be hindered by adherence to outdated standards. It's essential to evolve with the times and embrace new approaches, even if it means reprogramming oneself. 

While standards serve an important purpose, they can sometimes become outdated and overly restrictive. Striking a balance between tradition and progress is a challenge, as standards often lag behind technological advancements. It's crucial to avoid getting bogged down by unnecessary details and instead focus on practicality and efficiency. Embracing change and innovation is vital for staying relevant in the ever-evolving world of programming.</p>

            <p>Siemens S7 offers the same functionality as its counterparts. Rather than using --()-- in the middle of a rung, it uses --(#)-- instead. This feature is widely used in various applications and is essential for efficient operations. Understanding electrical diagrams is crucial, as it is similar to tapping voltage in the middle of a circuit to drive a relay. DamianInRochester raised a valid point about lengthy standards documents affecting the bidding process. It would be more efficient if companies specified industry standards and regulations, along with a concise list of specific requirements. Oftentimes, the actual needs of the project are minimal compared to the extensive specifications provided. It is important to prioritize the key wishes of the stakeholders rather than getting lost in unnecessary details.</p>

            <p>My journey in programming began with my first Fortran program on punch cards, and I have been hooked ever since. While my official title may not be programmer, my primary role is that of a control system designer. This entails programming various systems like PLCs, DCSs, SCADAs, HMIs, and more to bring our customers' concepts to life. It is crucial that anyone, whether a programmer or technician, can easily grasp the logic behind the control systems I create for troubleshooting or upgrading purposes.

Over the years, I have learned the importance of balancing simplicity and efficiency in programming. It is essential to have clear and concise logic that is easy to navigate, especially during system downtime. Our ultimate goal is not just manipulating data, but creating tangible outcomes in the real world. Our work impacts the production of goods, safety of individuals, and livelihoods of families.

When we are no longer here, it is vital that others can quickly understand and continue the work we have started. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize clarity and functionality in our programming efforts.</p>

            <p>Timbert inquired about the general public's perception of a certain practice. Personally, I find it to be unacceptable. Am I the only one feeling this way? I am accustomed to traditional ladder logic similar to relay logic, so the switch to a different coding style makes me skeptical. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that transitioning to a new approach is essential when developing applications for modern controllers. This programming style is a necessity due to the distinct operation of CPUs that allow it. Adapting to this style is crucial for utilizing the advanced features of these controllers efficiently. Ignoring this transition would only lead to inefficiency and underutilization of resources.</p>

            <p>According to James Mcquade, debugging a machine with complex logic can be a challenging task. He expressed frustration with having to debug a program with multiple layers of logic on a single rung. The idea that writing inefficient code is tied to using series OTEs is a misconception. While it is true that some programs in RSLogix500 may be poorly written, well-organized and readable code can still be created using series OTEs.

Regarding maintenance, Mcquade suggests that if someone is unable to wire a system, they should not be able to program it. However, it is important to note that a ladder program is not the same as a circuit diagram. The sequential execution of instructions in a ladder program differs from the behavior of electrical circuits. This distinction is a fundamental concept in engineering, as highlighted in Ron's boot camp teachings.</p>

            <p>DamianInRochester stated that there are two main types of instructions in programming: those that "test" memory/register values and those that "write" values to memory/registers. Despite some differences in functionality, both OTE and MOV instructions ultimately perform write operations on memory. Resistance to change in programming methodologies can stem from a desire to stick to familiar frameworks or outdated standards. While standards are important, they should not hinder progress and innovation in programming practices. Finding a balance between adhering to established norms and embracing new ideas is key to advancing in the programming field. Ultimately, it is crucial to evolve with the times while also respecting the foundations of programming principles.</p>

Ladder logic is not the same as a circuit diagram. Even without the complication of series coils, the programming and wiring processes are not identical. Ladder programs do not function in the same way as electrical circuits do. This fundamental principle is emphasized in Ron's boot camp, with numerous examples demonstrating why this misunderstanding is flawed.

Although ladder logic was initially designed to be a programming language that plant electricians could troubleshoot, advancements have led to additional functionalities. However, if programming is not done with electricians in mind, then using ladder logic may not be efficient.

For a more detailed analysis, input this code into a program and double-click each rung. In the ASCII text editor located above the ladder window, you will be able to view the specific instructions utilized.

            <p>Thank you for your comment, @dbh6. I personally embrace the flexibility of Logix5000's "de-restriction" of rung constructs, moving away from the limitations imposed by traditional electrical circuitry designs. While some may still adhere to the legacy viewpoint, I find it more beneficial to focus on the effectiveness of incorporating math comparisons and computational instructions in the code.

Instead of viewing the code as resembling a relay panel, I interpret it through the eyes of the processor. Conditional instructions like XIC, XIO, EQU, LES, etc., have the power to alter the "Rung Logic Continuity," whereas unconditional instructions such as OTE, OTL, MOV, etc., do not have the same impact.

In my practice, I often begin a rung with a MOV instruction to ensure that I am working with the most recent value in the MOV destination tag. This value may have been updated independently from the scan, either through I/O RPI or a periodic task.

When organizing instructions on rungs, it is advisable to place those deemed most likely to be false at the forefront. This approach prevents unnecessary database retrievals once a conditional instruction turns a rung false. Similarly, prioritize input branches that are expected to be true at the top to streamline the evaluation process and avoid unnecessary database access.

Moreover, it is essential to consider executing code only when necessary, which is where Periodic and Event tasks play a crucial role. By incorporating efficient methods to trigger specific events such as the start of an hour, day, month, new year, or changes in input states, the processor can allocate resources effectively to handle more critical tasks.

By integrating these concepts and optimizations into your programming approach, you can enhance the efficiency of your code execution and enable the processor to focus on higher-priority tasks.</p>

When I first encountered logic with an OTE in the middle of the rung, it was easy to understand by just applying the principles of XIO/XIC and OTE functions. It's pretty straightforward and neat. However, for less experienced users like maintenance personnel who may need to troubleshoot a machine issue at 2am, this type of logic may appear unfamiliar and confusing. In those cases, adding thorough comments to the program, as suggested by Geospark, can make a big difference. In my opinion, there can never be too many comments in a program.</p>

            <p>When discussing topics related to programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and ladder logic programming, there are several key issues that often arise. Firstly, there is a misconception that utilizing the added flexibility of software like RSLogix5000 makes the code harder to comprehend and less readable. However, it is important to note that poorly written and disorganized code is what truly hinders readability and debugging, not the advanced features of the software. In fact, incorporating elements such as a series coil can actually simplify the code and improve its overall clarity.

Secondly, when it comes to electricians, there are two main challenges that need to be addressed. There is a prevailing tendency to underestimate the capabilities of electricians while simultaneously expecting them to meet high demands. With the increasing complexity of modern machinery and technology, there is a growing need for electricians to enhance their skills and adapt to new advancements in the field. It is crucial to provide proper training and support for electricians to ensure they are able to effectively troubleshoot and maintain the sophisticated equipment they encounter.

Additionally, the way in which electricians are trained plays a significant role in their understanding of programming and ladder logic. By teaching them the fundamentals of programming and emphasizing the importance of approaching ladder logic as a circuit diagram, electricians can develop a deeper understanding of the logic behind PLC programming.

Lastly, it is essential to differentiate between the inability to understand a concept and the refusal to accept it. The resistance to embracing new methods, such as incorporating a series coil in programming, often stems from a lack of willingness to adapt rather than a genuine difficulty in comprehending the concept. By fostering a culture of openness to new ideas and approaches, we can encourage electricians to continuously improve their skills and stay current with the latest advancements in the industry.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, someone responsible for debugging a system should have the knowledge and skills to understand PLC code beyond just viewing it through a simple "contacts and coils" perspective. It is essential for individuals in this role to embrace new technologies rather than cling to outdated concepts like "mid-line coils." There are those who may resist these advancements, but they must learn to adapt in order to effectively work with PLCs.

I recall encountering a PLC with inverted outputs in the past, possibly made by Telemechanique or Square D. How would someone limited to a narrow view of "contacts and coils" handle such a scenario? Training is essential for individuals like "Bubba" before they are granted access to PLCs, ensuring they understand the differences between relay logic and PLC ladder visualization.

It is important to understand that the ladder diagram is merely a visual representation of a computer program that executes instructions sequentially. If "Bubba" were given a statement list equivalent of a sample rung, they should be able to comprehend its functionality. Those who struggle to grasp these concepts or refuse to accept them should not be permitted near PLCs.</p>

            <p>When working with the GE 90-30 PLC using Proficy Machine Edition software, it's worth noting that it has inverted outputs. Upon first encountering this, one might question why the programmer chose inverted outputs over regular ones.

            <p>The initial PLC software I utilized included Omron and Giddings & Lewis. Giddings & Lewis played a predominant role in my early projects, being pioneers in introducing unconventional programming capabilities for ladder logic. Their innovative approach included allowing all instructions to be in series, as well as incorporating NOT coils, P, N, NOT P, and NOT N contacts. What truly distinguished their ladder logic was the ability to create and download code that may have broken connections without affecting functionality. This feature enabled temporary disconnection of code segments without the need for deletion or additional disabling contacts. The grid-like layout of the ladder logic, resembling a spreadsheet, allowed for efficient code creation cell by cell, particularly if one memorized the hotkey combinations. I am intrigued about the software that first introduced the series coil instruction.</p>

            <p>In many of the systems I have worked on, we have utilized a technique known as "Arbitration" to manage plant devices such as valves and pumps. The main goal of arbitration was to prevent SCADA interference with plant operations during a process sequence. Activating the arbitration control for these devices meant toggling numerous bits for each sequence, sometimes even exceeding 50 bits on a lengthy or intricate route. Visualize having to individually address each arbitration bit on separate branches or rungs â€“ a tedious task indeed! Thanks to the series output capability of Logix5000, we were able to streamline this process by consolidating all bits on a single rung and utilizing "rung wrapping" on the display for easy access. Moreover, there are memory and speed considerations to take into account. Each branch adds an additional 3 instructions to the code, meaning that a branched setup for 30 coils would demand an extra 90 instructions, occupying memory and impacting execution efficiency. This approach not only depletes resources unnecessarily but also complicates code navigation. It may seem like we are underestimating Bubba's intelligence, as understanding a computer program displayed on a monitor should not be equated to a traditional relay panel with wires and terminals. Even early PLCs offered mathematical functions and comparison instructions that differ significantly from relay-based systems. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that Bubba can grasp the concept of an output "coil" instruction and its sequential or mid-line placement within the program.</p>

            <p>I apologize for revisiting this topic, but I wanted to respond when I had the time and had cooled off a bit. It seems we may not be giving Bubba enough credit. It's possible for them to recognize that they are viewing a computer monitor displaying a computer program. It's unlikely that anyone would mistake it for a traditional metal box filled with relays and wires. As Homer J. Simpson humorously asked, "Where's the ANY key?"

I find it interesting, rather than offensive, that there is a lack of confidence in "Bubba." I hope this term is used affectionately. There are numerous quotes I could reference from this discussion, but it's time to move on from the negativity. It's clear that not all electricians are as technologically challenged as some imply.

In my experience as a contractor, I have encountered electricians with varying levels of proficiency. Some excel in domestic and commercial settings but struggle with industrial projects. Among those who are skilled in industrial work, a few show interest beyond basic tasks. However, truly knowledgeable PLC electricians are rare.

I have also worked with subpar software engineers who lack attention to detail. One individual sent out faulty programs without properly commissioning them on-site. Their work was riddled with errors and flaws, causing significant issues. In contrast, a training session I attended proved to be a disappointment, with the instructor's lack of expertise in the specific platform being taught.

Ultimately, there are both good and bad professionals in every field. As someone hired as a technician despite being an electrician by trade, I have diversified my skill set to include PLC programming. A thorough understanding of various tools and technologies can make an electrician more versatile and valuable in their work.

In conclusion, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Some prioritize the technical aspects of PLCs, while others focus on practical application. Regardless, maintaining clear and organized coding practices is essential. Our company emphasizes the importance of easily understandable code, ensuring projects are well-documented and structured.

In summary, Bubba's perspective offers valuable insights into the diverse skill sets and approaches within the electrical industry. It's essential to communicate effectively and maintain clarity in our work for the benefit of future readers and colleagues alike.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,

Although this forum may be older, I wanted to share my thoughts on a topic that I found interesting. I came here seeking validation for my opinions and ended up learning a great deal from the community. I now understand that placing coils in the middle of a rung can lead to issues if not carefully considered. It is crucial to think before programming and testing thoroughly to avoid any potential troubleshooting challenges. However, when used correctly, a coil in the middle of a rung can enhance readability and efficiency.

In my own experience, I found it necessary to add a condition to existing logic before allowing a part to move forward on a CV. The most straightforward way for me to achieve this was by placing a coil in the middle of a rung. Let me explain further. This particular rung controls the "Auto Start CMD" from CV 1 to CV 2, advancing the part to the next station. I needed to ensure that this advancement only occurred once a traceability signal was sent and received. By adding a "received" coil to the rung, I could easily accomplish this. However, the challenge then became triggering the action.

While I could have created a separate trigger, it felt more natural to place a coil (Trigger) before the contact (Response). This allowed me to trigger the action only when necessary and immediately await the response. By having the trigger and response in close proximity, I eliminated the need to search for the trigger in case of a missed response. This approach also prevented the need to duplicate the entire logic before the coil, simplifying the process and ensuring logical consistency.

I believe that maintaining logic sharing within a rung is crucial to prevent any discrepancies in case of future changes. While I could have isolated the new logic with a separate branch, it would have required additional work and potentially compromised the original design of the rung. By integrating a coil in the middle, I effectively established a handshake protocol.

In regards to Logix, it's worth mentioning that [ONS]/OneShots/pulses are also considered coils, and in my experience, they are frequently positioned in the middle of a rung. This allows for flexible programming, such as pulsing one side and using the same tag elsewhere as a contact, which can be incredibly beneficial.

Thank you for reading, and I hope this insight proves helpful in your own programming endeavors.</p>

            <p>There was a certain individual at a previous workplace who consistently made errors in their coding, such as having the coil and unlatch instruction act on the same bit. They also had a tendency to use the same bit for both the last contact and coil in their coding. This individual is still causing issues in plants worldwide, despite their lack of competence in computer programming.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea mentioned: "Click to expand...XIO1&XIC2&XIC3&OTE3." They explained that in a situation where the last contact and coil are identical, it can serve as a NOP instruction. This setup typically works by having the coil/last XIC bit triggered by the HMI when both XIO1 and XIC2 conditions are met. It remains latched until either XIO1 or XIC2 become false. This method is commonly used to latch HMI/IO buttons or signals.</p>

            <p>PreLC noted that using NOP is one method of writing code. I recently encountered a system with numerous checks in place to ensure a particular bit remained active throughout the program. The bit would turn on immediately if both the MCR and Estop inputs were active. Following this, there were approximately 50 rings of checks that would assess various conditions and, if met, activate the bit. If any of the conditions within the rings were not met, the bit would be turned off. Additionally, these 50 rings were dispersed throughout the program.</p>

            <p>PreLC mentioned that using a mix of latches is one method to write an NOP in a program. However, this approach can make troubleshooting difficult, as the bit will continue on only if the bit is on and the preceding bit is also on. Otherwise, it will turn off. Despite having logic elements that serve no purpose, this is how the system operates. This unique methodology has led to many integrators choosing not to work on this system, much to the dismay of my manager, who lacks knowledge of controls. The integrators refuse to work on the system, not due to cost concerns, but because they prefer to avoid the associated stress and complexities it brings to their work.</p>

            <p>Resurrected like a Phoenix from the ashes, an old thread discusses the transition from electrical circuits to PLC logic. Initially praised for its simplicity, the ladder representation of code was deemed easy to understand for beginners. However, as PLC instructions became more complex, the distinction between computer language and hard-wired circuits blurred.

Unlike physical hardware equivalents, PLC instructions exist solely as lines of code within a program. Despite the initial appeal of this analogy, some individuals continue to struggle with this concept even after decades in the industry. In my experience training with Rockwell, I emphasized that PLC instructions can be categorized into two types: those that observe a condition and those that carry out an action.

Each instruction operates independently, solely dependent on the true/false state of the rung it is connected to. With the introduction of mid-line "coils" in the ControlLogix platform, I found them to be advantageous in terms of code efficiency and execution speed. These "do something" instructions solidify the logic flow, preventing unintended disruptions.

Embracing mid-line coils in my projects, I have come to appreciate their benefits despite any reservations about their unconventional placement. As an industry veteran, my acceptance of modern PLC practices reflects my adaptability and continued growth in the field.</p>
