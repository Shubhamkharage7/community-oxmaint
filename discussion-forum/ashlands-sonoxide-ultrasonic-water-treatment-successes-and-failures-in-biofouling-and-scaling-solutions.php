                    <p>In line with our commitment to environmental sustainability, one of our facilities recently made the switch to a Sonoxide Ultrasonic water treatment system, replacing traditional chemical treatments. While researching online, I came across conflicting information - one article mentioned a failure, but there are also success stories shared by the manufacturer, "Ashland". I'm interested to hear from anyone who has used this system to address biofouling and scaling issues. Your insights are appreciated. - Jack</p>

            <p>Jack, Our team was recently commissioned by Griswold to provide our services and expertise at Jacksonville Electric Authority. We have implemented the Griswold WAVE technology on three major district cooling systems at the facility. The innovative Griswold Wave system is specifically engineered to effectively manage microbiological growth and prevent scale formation. So far, it has shown exceptional results in controlling microbiological growth, with biocount levels consistently below 1,000 cfu/ml.

While the WAVE system does not directly eliminate algae, it has been successful in minimizing algae growth. We have also initiated trials on an ultrasonic system for algae control, although further data is needed to draw conclusive results. Monitoring of approach temperatures, head pressures, and condenser inspections over the past year has indicated excellent scale control with the WAVE system.

I strongly suggest daily monitoring of cooling water parameters such as conductivity, velocity, approach temperatures, and head pressure, complemented by monthly evaluations of cooling water cycles through precise chloride testing. Due to the influence of the WAVE system on water properties, it is essential to calculate cycles based on chloride levels rather than hardness or conductivity. The corrosion rate and scale formation are significantly impacted by cooling water cycles and velocity.

To enhance our monitoring capabilities, we have implemented remote alarm systems linked to a data logger on our computers via cellular technology. For visuals of our work, please visit: http://www.engineeredwater.us/...n-chemical_treatment

Sincerely,
Rick Ruckstuhl</p>
