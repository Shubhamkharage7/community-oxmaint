It appears that the configuration has been uploaded successfully, despite some differences in hardware configuration. The original program was likely created using VersaPro software, although I am currently using version 10.1.9647 of Proficy Machine Edition.

            <p>If you're interested in trying out Logicmaster for uploading purposes, simply message me your email address. With version 8.2 firmware, it could have been programmed using either Logicmaster or VersaPro. I've already uploaded LM90 to my Google Drive and can easily add you to the shared list. In case Logicmaster doesn't function properly, I can also provide the VersaPro CD for upload.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey mentioned that if you want to attempt uploading using Logicmaster, please send him a private message containing your email address. With version 8.2 firmware, it was possible to program it with either Logicmaster or VersaPro. He has already uploaded LM90 to his Google drive and will include you in the sharing list. If Logicmaster is not successful, he can also upload the VersaPro CD. However, there was an issue with uploading LM90. While the Hardware Config could be uploaded, an error occurred when trying to upload the Logic, indicating an incomplete program folder. It may be necessary to reload or restore the logic to resolve this issue.</p>

            <p>If you are encountering connectivity issues when using a USB/serial converter, you may be experiencing a common problem that arises without a real serial port on your computer. This can lead to intermittent disconnections, particularly when uploading or downloading programs in software like Logicmaster. To resolve this issue, consider transitioning to Proficy by creating a new project and importing the Logicmaster project file, including both logic and hardware configurations. This simple switch can help maintain a stable connection and improve overall performance.</p>

            <p>When using LM90, I utilized a genuine serial port. However, I encountered difficulties uploading the LM90 folder into Proficy due to an error indicating it was programmed in a version of LM90 older than version 6. It seems likely that the CPU had an eprom installed that was written in an outdated version, causing the initial issues. Noticing the eprom sooner could have saved time, as all that was needed was transferring the program from one CPU to another. Steve Bailey suggested using a USB/serial converter may result in connection loss, similar to the experience of not using a computer with a physical serial port. To resolve this issue when converting to Proficy, begin by creating a new project in Proficy and then importing the Logicmaster project file, including both logic and hardware configuration.</p>
