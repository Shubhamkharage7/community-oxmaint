                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Good afternoon! I am currently working on implementing arc-on time tracking for manual welders to justify investing in better jigs. I have a spare PLC that I planned to use to monitor when significant currents are flowing into the welding machines. I have tried out various AC current monitoring switches, including the Johnson Controls CSDSC-C50100L, Eaton ECSNOASP, AcuAmp ACS150-AE-S, and AcuAmp ACSN250-AE-S. Despite ensuring proper setup and testing around different power sources, I am still facing issues with getting them to function. 

I am exploring alternatives to avoid cutting and rewiring cables, as my goal is to install these switches at multiple manual welder stations within a large facility. I am hesitant to create separate mini panels for each device, as it would involve dealing with high voltage power cables. Additionally, I have considered DC switches, but the cables from the welder to the torch are significantly thick. Any insights or suggestions on where I may be going wrong in my setup process would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Have you considered attaching the clamps to the power supply cable or cord that powers the welder? If so, you should observe zero net amps when combining the line and neutral currents. However, it is possible for the clamps to be effective when connected to the welding lead leading to the electrode.</p>

            <p>In response to a query by joseph_e2, I have installed the device on the power supply cable leading to the welder. While I expected to see zero net amps (Line + neutral = 0), I was surprised to find conflicting information as one source listed monitoring welders as a recommended use for the device. The advantage of using a split-core design is the ability to fit it around an existing cable. I plan to take measurements and search for a DC switch capable of handling the thick cable leading to the welding torch.</p>
