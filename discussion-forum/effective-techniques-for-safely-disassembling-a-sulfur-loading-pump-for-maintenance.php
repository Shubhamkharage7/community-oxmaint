            <p>It is essential for seals to have a quench connection in accordance with API 682 in order to effectively remove sulfur buildup in the seal area. Look for the 'Q' marking and plug on the seal housing when the connection is not in use. This is crucial for maintaining the performance and longevity of the seal. Keep your equipment running smoothly with proper quench connections as recommended by industry standards. Don't forget to check for the marked 'Q' and plug when inspecting your seal housing.</p>

            <p>The steam quenching connection in the seal is currently operational and not blocked. This seal is equipped with a steam connection for jacketing and quenching (according to API plan 62). However, I'm facing difficulty in loosening the Grub screws that secure the locking sleeve on the shaft. Should I consider using a gas cutting set to heat the seal and melt away the sulfur? It's important to note that sulfur is flammable and handling it in this manner can be hazardous and unsafe.</p>

            <p>Swapnil, you are correct in recognizing that you are handling a potentially dangerous product. Have you discussed this issue with the pump vendor? It is essential to check if the pump has the necessary connections for a solvent or steam hookup at the inlet and outlet. Both the solvent and the effluent can pose health risks due to their toxicity and flammability. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the design and follow your Plant Change Procedure, which should include a thorough risk analysis, including a HAZOP study.

In laboratory settings, Carbon disulphide was commonly used as a solvent, but its industrial applications should be verified. There are commercially available products like Paratene S700 (a toxic product manufactured by Woodrising Resources Ltd., Canada) or organic disulfide-polysulfide sulfur solvents used in sour gas production. It is advisable to conduct further research on these options to determine their suitability for your specific needs.

It is important to remember that finding a solution may take time, and there is no quick fix. Stay in close communication with the pump vendor and seek their technical expertise. As a short-term measure, avoid using a gas torch and opt for a steam lance to melt the sulfur instead. A steam flush through the pump could also be a safe alternative to using a solvent, if feasible.</p>

            <p>Corrosion can make it challenging to remove sleeve grub screws, which is why Hastalloy is commonly used for these applications today. It is important to ensure the seal components' material is compatible with sulphur. For vibration analysis tools like Vibmaster, using the right materials is key.</p>

            <p>Vee's recommendation is worth considering. I have observed individuals cleaning acid and alkali unloading pumps regularly after operations. They utilize high-pressure DM water to flush out the pump and prevent buildup and eventual hardening. The process is crucial for maintaining pump efficiency and prolonging its lifespan. - Vibmaster</p>
