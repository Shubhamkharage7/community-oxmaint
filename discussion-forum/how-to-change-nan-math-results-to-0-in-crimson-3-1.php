            <p>I have not yet utilized the Crimson, but I believe it is possible to do so. The "NaN" bit representation can be depicted in various ways, as indicated on WikipediaNaN - Wikipedia. You can verify the 32 bits as a bit array and replace any instances with all 32 bits as 0 (false). Essentially, a script needs to be created to achieve this task.</p>

            <p>When NAN appears in calculations, it represents Not A Number and occurs when the result of a math operation is undefined. Division by zero is a common cause of NAN. To prevent NAN errors, implement an If function to check for zero divisors before proceeding with the math operation. You can use an Else statement to assign a specific value to the result in such cases. While mathematics may deal with concepts like infinity and imaginary numbers, they may not be suitable for practical applications such as calculating machine speed.</p>

            <p>The occurrence of NAN (not a number) is typically related to data inconsistency, most commonly seen in floating-point numbers. While divide by zero errors usually result in a minor fault that shuts down the PLC, it is likely not a mathematical function issue. It appears that a tag is being utilized as an integer or float when it is not, but the interpretation of this error depends on the specific PLC or HMI system being used.</p>

            <p>Prevent NAN errors by using this code snippet: if(someValue <> 0) { doTheCalculation; } else { calculationResult = 0; }. Remember, avoiding issues before they occur is crucial. Embrace the principle of 'prevention is better than cure' to keep your program running smoothly. Redlion and Crimson software are helpful tools in this regard by alerting you to potential errors.</p>

            <p>tbialek noted that during OEE calculation, when a machine is idle, the "performance" and "quality" tags display as NAN (resulting from division by zero). Data is logged to CSV and then transferred to Excel for correction. However, tbialek was looking to change the "NAN" tag to "0" before logging to CSV. BryanG suggested preventing NANs from occurring in the first place. If that is not feasible (due to the calculation not being performed in Crimson), it was recommended to explore the language used in Crimson for a function like anisanan() or an equivalent. If such a function is not available, and if Crimson has access to the 32 bits of the REAL, a method such as copying 32-bit REAL variable bits to a 32-bit integer variable bits using functions like Copy or ForceCopy could be considered. This would involve identifying all 1-valued bits in the exponent (bits 23-30), and at least one 1-valued bit in bits 0-22 (the fraction) to recognize a NAN.</p>

            <p>Dr. Bitboy pointed out that Crimson lacks the capability to directly convert the bits of a floating-point number into the bits of an integer. He suggested possibly using a Modbus slave or another workaround for this conversion. Is it possible to link RealToR64 and R64ToInt functions together? It might require some careful editing to ensure the bits are being transferred correctly. Who better to seek advice from than you?</p>

            <p>Drbitboy mentioned that transferring bits of a float into an integer may not be possible with Crimson alone, requiring an intermediate Modbus slave or workaround. While breaking out the bits of a float with the .0, .1, .2 format is an option, it is not typically used for bit packing. What type of device are you utilizing that requires a bit-packed float?</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, modiconguy suggested linking RealToR64 and R64ToInt, noting that understanding the bit placement might require some adjustments. In this scenario, RealToR64's knowledge of NaNs and Infs is crucial, as the bit configurations for these values differ. It may be sufficient to use only RealToR64 without involving R64ToInt, as the latter only manipulates the value, not the bits.

To determine which DINT element holds the exponent and sign bits of the R64, a simple test can be conducted using the Real value 1.0 and applying RealToR64. By removing the sign bit from the high DINT, the correct bit range for the exponent can be identified.

NaN and Inf cases can be identified by specific bit patterns in the exponent bits. By carefully examining the bit shifts and values within the DINTs, one can accurately distinguish between regular numbers and special cases like NaN and Inf. While the approach may not account for signaling vs. quiet NaN, it highlights the need for thorough testing in code implementation, especially when dealing with complex data types like NaN and Inf in programming languages.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, BryanG advises to prevent NANs by implementing a conditional statement in the code. The code snippet provided checks if a certain value is not equal to zero before performing a calculation. If the value is not zero, the calculation is executed; otherwise, the result is set to zero. This strategy follows the adage "an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure." By avoiding NANs in other systems, potential program crashes are averted. It is important to note that Redlion and Crimson systems are programmed to prevent such errors, ensuring smooth operation. The solution provided by BryanG has been confirmed to be effective.</p>
