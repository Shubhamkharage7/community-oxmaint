            <p>Sean Teague mentioned that the machines in question are very outdated, with the company that manufactured them no longer in business. To address this issue, Engineerj22 recommended installing Japanese CX One (CX Programmer) and possibly reinstalling the software, allowing for language selection during the process. Subsequently, a conversion of the Japanese interface to English may also be necessary.</p>

            <p>If you have encountered Japanese language comments in the copy you opened, you may need to install a language pack or font to revert back to them. Unfortunately, if the project was saved with gibberish unicode characters by the previous user, it may not be fixable in some cases, such as in Mitsubishi systems. This issue is something I come across frequently.</p>

            <p>After experimenting with converting text to hexadecimal and various languages using online tools like an ASCII to Hex converter and Hex to ASCII converter from RapidTables, I attempted to translate it into Chinese. While I managed to obtain rough translations for some words like "cylinder" and "enquiry," the overall translation remained elusive. Despite using the UTF-16 encoding method, the best result I achieved was: "The following is a summary of the findings and recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination." However, I am uncertain if this translation is accurate.</p>

            <p>Your phone can automatically translate text using the picture app. I have personally set it up and found it very useful while browsing through logic on my computer. This feature comes in handy when dealing with old Japanese manuals as well. Additionally, it's a useful tool to have when traveling to different countries, especially for quickly finding a restroom in a foreign language. While I'm not sure about how well Cx imports and exports tags and comments, it may be possible to find and replace Japanese symbols. However, be cautious of miscompiled translations, as I recently encountered some jibberish when attempting to use Google Translate on a specific text. Initially, I misunderstood the text as rude, but it turned out to be a misinterpretation.</p>

            <p>I have experience conducting this specific type of file conversion in the past. Regrettably, Omron CX Programmer does not support Windows fonts, making it necessary to have access to Windows Japanese fonts when performing any conversion task. I recently tested Puddle's approach and was able to decode the first line as "Cutter ST clamp PL" in Shift JIS (Japanese). However, the translation of the second line was not successful. This could be due to a typing error or a faulty copy and paste.</p>

            <p>1) Switch the Region and Language Settings of your computer to Japanese by selecting "Japanese" under "Current System locale". 2) In CX Programmer, navigate to Tools -> Options -> Appearance -> 2a) Modify all font settings to MS Mincho Font with "script" set to Japanese for a more authentic display.</p>
