            <p>During our college years, my roommate and I developed a strong passion for rugby, a sport that can be likened to football but is characterized by jaw-dropping lateral plays. Instead of spending hours on Madden, we found ourselves immersed in the thrilling world of rugby for a good part of a year. One unique aspect of the game was a specific button dedicated to executing a tackle that would result in a penalty, akin to the hit stick feature in Madden, except in rugby, the referees would promptly flag you for it every time - quite the humorous touch, if you ask me.

Our enthusiasm for rugby even spilled over into our living space, as tossing the rugby ball around eventually led to the demise of at least one ongoing board game night. Apologies to Axis and Allies, but you were outshined by the excitement of rugby.

Despite our deep interest in the sport, following rugby on US TV proved to be a bit challenging, so our rugby adventures didn't progress as far as we had hoped. Ultimately, our brief but intense rugby phase made for some memorable and entertaining times during our college years.</p>

            <p>mk42 mentioned that it's difficult to keep up with US TV coverage of football games, which has hindered their progress in following the sport. This is a common issue faced by football fans in the UK as well. For instance, my favorite team competes in League One, the third tier of English football, and is limited to just two televised matches per season. This lack of TV coverage makes it challenging to legally follow the team, especially for those unable to attend games regularly.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>One common frustration with football in the UK is the lack of televised coverage for lower-league teams like mine, who compete in League One, the 3rd tier of English football. This limited exposure makes it challenging for fans who cannot attend matches to follow their team legally. Obtaining videos of sports where the UK is not particularly competitive, such as water polo, can be nearly impossible. Despite the popularity of sports like boxing and men's football, access to diverse sports like those showcased in the Olympics should be more widely available for all audiences.</p>
