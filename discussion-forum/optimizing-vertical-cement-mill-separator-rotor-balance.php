Hello everyone, 

We are seeking your assistance with the Vertical Cement Mill Separator Rotor Balancing. In the attached images, you will find detailed information about the facilities. Your insights and experiences would be greatly appreciated. 

After installing new blades, we have observed a slight increase in vibrations to 1.8 mm/ss. Although not alarmingly high, we are aiming to reduce them further. Feel free to share any relevant images and stay connected as we exchange any necessary details. 

Additionally, we have a new analyzer, 2140, that we plan to utilize fully in this process. 

Thank you, 

Manuel Ortiz</p>

            <p>Hello Manuel, Do you remember the previous vibration level before replacing the blade? Currently, it is at 1.8 mm/s, which is considered good for this type of equipment. It may be challenging to improve further. Regards, Serge Borrell. We are seeking assistance with balancing the rotor of the Vertical Cement Mill Separator ROKS 37.5. After installing new blades, vibrations have increased slightly to 1.8 mm/s. We are looking for ways to reduce these vibrations. Feel free to share your insights and experiences with us. We have also acquired a new 2140 analyzer that we plan to utilize fully. Stay connected and share any necessary information. Thank you, Manuel Ortiz.</p>

            <p>Hello Serge,

The vibrations are low when testing the separator with the mill stopped, but reach levels of 12 to 13 mm/s when the mill is in operation, especially with certain types of cement at the highest speed of 200 RPMs in the rotor.

Serge Borrell asked about the vibration levels before blade replacement, which were at 1.8 mm/s, a good level that is challenging to improve for this equipment.

We are seeking support for balancing the air separator rotor in the Vertical Cement Mill ROKS 37.5. Installation of new blades may have led to a slight increase in vibrations to 1.8 mm/s, which we are looking to reduce. We have included images for reference and are open to sharing experiences and any necessary information. We now have a new analyzer, the 2140, that we aim to utilize fully.

Thank you,
Manuel Ortiz</p>

            <p>It appears that the high vibration levels are linked to the load and rpm of a specific type of cement used. The increase in load may be attributed to the unique characteristics of this cement type. Alternatively, at the same load, vibration levels may decrease as the rpm is lowered. If you're experiencing similar issues with a Vertical Cement Mill Separator Rotor Balancing for an AIR SEPARATOR ROKS 37.5 Vertical Mill, reach out for support. By sharing experiences and utilizing a new analyzer like the 2140, vibrations can be effectively managed and reduced. Let's work together to address any concerns and optimize the operation of the facility. Stay connected for updates and feel free to provide any necessary information.</p>

            <p>Jose, your observations are accurate. As the RPMs on the rotor increase, the Motor kW Power also increases. Best regards, Manuel E. Ortiz O., Project Engineer & Reliability Advisor. Contact: +52(614) 1959494. Message dated 1/31/2024.

Message from Jose Castellanos on 1/31/2024 regarding the high vibration in a Vertical Mill related to load and RPM for a specific type of cement. The vibration may decrease as RPM decreases due to additional forces of the cement type.

Seeking support for balancing the Air Separator ROKS 37.5 in a Vertical Cement Mill. New blades have been installed, potentially causing increased vibrations at 1.8 mm/ss. Looking to reduce vibrations. Sharing images and requesting experiences from others. Introducing new analyzer 2140 for monitoring purposes. Contact Manuel Ortiz for more information.</p>

            <p>When encountering high-speed and high-load vibrations in industrial equipment, it is essential to inspect various components for potential issues. Specifically, check the coupling setup for any abnormalities and verify the spring pressure in coupling bearings. Additionally, assess how the bearings are preloaded and determine if replacements are necessary. Consider the impact of thermal expansion on the shaft to prevent overloading the bearings when heated. In a recent discussion regarding balancing the air separator ROKS 37.5 in a vertical mill, it was noted that motor power increases with RPMs on the rotor. This observation suggests that the vibration levels may be influenced by the specific type of cement being used. Collaborating and sharing experiences with industry professionals can help address and reduce any vibrations, ultimately optimizing equipment performance. Stay connected and utilize specialized analyzers like the 2140 to effectively monitor and adjust equipment as needed. By addressing these factors proactively, businesses can enhance reliability and efficiency in their operations.</p>
