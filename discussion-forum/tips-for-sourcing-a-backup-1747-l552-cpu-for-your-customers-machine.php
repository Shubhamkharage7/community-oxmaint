                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Our current project involves discussing the upgrade of a customer's machine's Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Human Machine Interface (HMI) which is scheduled for next Fall. However, a month ago, the customer's SLC 5/05 experienced a crash and we replaced it with a back-up CPU. Now, the customer has requested a back-up CPU in case of another failure before the scheduled upgrade. I recall a cautionary discussion on the risks of purchasing SLCs from online platforms like Ebay. Despite the customer's preference to avoid products from China, it is important to note that the issue goes beyond just that. Attached is an image of the current CPU for your reference. Can you provide any specific details to consider while sourcing a 1747-L552 CPU for our buyer?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you're looking for the most dependable option, purchasing a brand new unit is your best bet, despite the higher cost. These units are nearing the end of their product life cycle and will no longer be available after 3/31/2024, with a price tag of nearly $16,000. It's recommended to consider sourcing from a reputable US-based company like Radwell, which offers warranties for added peace of mind. Remember to conduct thorough testing as soon as you receive the unit to ensure its functionality.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When purchasing critical spares, it's recommended to buy from a trusted refurbisher like Radwell.com for warranties, certified products, and genuine items. Although the price may be higher, customers can have peace of mind knowing they are getting quality products. Additionally, there are reliable members within the community who sell used parts that you can consider as well.</p>

            <p>If I were to purchase a similar item from Ebay, my first step would be to switch it out and use the current one as a backup. Instead of choosing Radwell, I prefer to support a trusted brand like Allen Bradley 1747-L552 /C FRN 13 Ethernet Series C 5/05 SLC500 32k Mem PLC. Get your PLC cables, trainers, and industrial automation supplies at www.plccable.com - your one-stop shop for all your automation needs.</p>
