                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>To enhance the dependability of Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) post-cleaning and gasket replacement, it is crucial to follow a comprehensive procedure during the reassembly process. Despite taking all necessary precautions, a plate exchanger experienced leakage upon startup after being cleaned and fitted with new original gaskets during a turnaround. Without the need for a shutdown, the leakage was rectified online by applying external sealant. Moving forward, what are the key steps to ensure the secure boxing up of plate exchangers following maintenance to avoid such incidents in the future? - Regards, Sajjad Hussain.</p>

            <p>I have faced this issue in the past where consistent pressure is necessary for tightening bolts. To clean a scaled plate surface effectively, we rely on a specialized chemical that restores stainless steel's shine without causing damage. Additionally, we use a fluid medium, usually cooling water, to maintain optimal operating conditions for our two heat exchangers. Depending on specific operations or maintenance needs, these heat exchangers can be operated either in parallel or series.</p>
