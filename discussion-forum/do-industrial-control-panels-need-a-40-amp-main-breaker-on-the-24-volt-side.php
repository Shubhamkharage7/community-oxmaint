                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Many industrial control panels feature a main breaker on the 24-volt side of the power supply, which then supplies power to smaller breakers. For example, a 40 amp power supply may have a 40 amp breaker on the +24 side that feeds 20 amp breakers connected to 24-volt branch circuits. Is it required by code to have the 40 amp breaker in place? It may be possible to simply connect a bus to the top of a row of breakers fed from +24 and directly supply branch circuit breakers. This setup raises questions about the necessity of the 40 amp breaker as mandated by electrical codes.</p>

            <p>Is it necessary to have a breaker solely dedicated to powering other breakers? This may seem redundant, especially for low voltage systems.</p>

            <p>I had the same thought - it seems redundant. If the intention was to have a single switch to power everything down, a simple switch or disconnect would suffice. After reviewing my coding notes, I couldn't find any indication one way or the other. I personally don't think it is necessary. The code specifies breaker/protection based on factors like power draw and distance, with no mention of one protection device preceding another. In my experience with industrial panels, I have never encountered this setup, so I recommend verifying that the 40 amp breaker doesn't feed the 20 amp breakers in another sub panel or device. It is more common for me to come across panels with no breakers or with bypassed ones due to frequent tripping. Those in the industry for a while can confirm this. So, consider yourself fortunate in this situation.</p>

            <p>A great method to avoid overloading a power supply without using a 40A breaker is by distributing the load among multiple 20A individual breakers. By connecting 10 20A breakers to a 40A power supply, you can distribute a total potential of 200A safely. Just like in a house panel, where the main breaker safeguards the power supply while the branch breakers protect the individual feeder conductors and devices. This setup ensures that the transformer and feeders are protected while effectively distributing power to outlets and devices throughout the home.</p>

            <p>Robertmee suggested a risky method of overloading a power supply by using multiple 20A breakers instead of a 40A breaker. By connecting 10 20A breakers to a 40A power supply, you could potentially draw up to 200A from it. However, it is important to remember that the branch breakers are there to protect the individual feeder conductors, while the main breaker is there to safeguard the power supply as a whole. While this may work in theory, it's worth noting that most DC power supplies are self-limiting and may not be able to handle such high loads.</p>

            <p>In the world of electrical systems, it's important to ensure the proper protection is in place to safeguard power supplies. Imagine having a 40A power supply but feeding it with 10 individual 20A breakers, potentially drawing a total of 200A towards the power supply. Branch breakers are crucial as they safeguard the feeder conductors individually, while the main breaker acts as the protector of the power supply itself.

This concept is akin to the setup in a typical household panel. With a 200A or 400A main breaker, more individual breakers can be accommodated, drawing more current collectively. The main breaker serves as the defense for the transformer and feeders supplying electricity to the house, while the individual breakers shield the outlets and devices within the home.

In a controls cabinet scenario, such as the one discussed by @robertmee, the focus is on low voltage DC systems where inrush and starting currents are minimal compared to AC or high current DC setups. It's essential to consider the number of 20A breakers and their corresponding loads/devices downstream to ensure optimal performance and safety. Let's deepen our understanding of this topic with insights from @cary_mur001.</p>

            <p>durallymax mentioned that while in theory, most DC power supply units (PSUs) are self-limiting, breakers serve a crucial role in unforeseen circumstances. Breakers are a safety measure for situations where the unexpected occurs, rather than when everything is functioning as planned.</p>

            <p>durallymax mentioned that while DC power supplies are technically self-limiting, it may be wiser to install a breaker for added safety. Choosing a breaker over relying solely on a DC power supply's self-limiting capabilities can help prevent potential fire hazards. It's better to prioritize safety and invest in a breaker for peace of mind.</p>

            <p>The Allen Bradley 1606-XLS960E-3 is a 24VDC power supply designed for 3 phase 480VAC input, providing 960 Watts or 40 amps. While the focus is often on the AC input, questions arise about the DC output and breaker configuration. Some circuits feature a 40 amp breaker at the DC+ as a main, which then distributes power to smaller breakers like 20 amps. These smaller breakers protect the wiring, typically 12 AWG in this case. Is the 40 amp breaker required by code, or is it included for another purpose by Engineers?</p>

            <p>When discussing the Allen Bradley 1606-XLS960E-3 power supply, it's important to note that it is a 24VDC system designed for 3 phase 480VAC input, delivering 960 Watts or 40 amps. The main focus here is not on the AC input, but rather on the DC output and breaker configuration.

Typically, some circuit designs incorporate a 40 amp breaker immediately after the DC + as a main breaker, which then branches off to feed other breakers like two or three 20 amp breakers. These smaller breakers, protecting wiring such as 12 AWG, raise the question of whether the 40 amp breaker is required by electrical code or if engineers include it for another purpose.

In a scenario with three 20A breakers, the 40A supply could potentially see 60A without trip protection, other than internal self limiters. This explains the necessity for the 40A breaker in the system.</p>

            <p>@robertmee, I understand your perspective and value feedback from everyone. The power supply in question is a switching type capable of handling a 50% load for 5 seconds before shutting down. However, relying solely on this feature for protection may not be wise. It may be feasible to use two 20 amp breakers or four 10 amp breakers to stay at or below 40 amps and avoid the need for a 40 amp breaker. However, this may not be the ideal practice either. Maybe I needed a bit more caffeine when I initiated this discussion earlier. Thank you to all contributors.</p>
