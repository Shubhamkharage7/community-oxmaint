            <p>Modbus TCP/IP operates on Ethernet infrastructure, as explained by Steve Bailey. This protocol involves wrapping a modbus packet within a standard Ethernet protocol packet. A dedicated encoder is required to encapsulate the data, while a TCP/IP decoder is needed to extract the information. Attempting to send a modbus packet to a conventional Ethernet device will not yield the desired outcome.

A crucial question to consider is whether modbus TCP/IP packets can coexist with standard Ethernet packets on the same network without causing disruptions. Typically, the module processes PLC data, generates a modbus packet, encases it in an Ethernet packet, and transmits it accordingly.</p>

            <p>You initially asked about locating a module for the Rx3i that can communicate using Modbus TCP/IP. After some research, I found a suitable module. Although you expressed some skepticism, I am confident that the IC695ETM001 is capable of handling the complex double wrapped packets associated with Modbus TCP/IP. The module's specifications, as listed in the GFA-406F catalog on page 65 under the "Protocol Support" section, confirm that it supports Modbus TCP as both a client and a server. This means that the module can both encapsulate and transmit packets, as well as receive and extract packets.</p>

            <p>One important consideration is whether the module requires configuration for Modbus TCP/IP. If so, it will only support Modbus TCP/IP, meaning an additional module set for Ethernet would be needed for Standard Ethernet communication. This leads to the question of whether two modules are necessary for the setup.</p>

            <p>In order to enable Modbus TCP/IP on the port, it must be properly configured. Once configured, it should be dedicated solely to Modbus TCP/IP. It may be feasible to adjust the port configuration using commands within ladder logic, although this is uncertain. To explore the possibility, refer to the module manual for information on "COMREQ" functions. However, even if adjustments are possible, the port will need to cease Modbus TCP/IP communication when utilizing "Standard Ethernet Comm". The simplest solution would likely involve adding a second ETM001. The additional physical port on the module functions as an unmanaged switch. It is important to note that only one IP address can be assigned to the module. For more details, refer to the manual with publication number GFK-2224F.</p>

            <p>Make sure to obtain the manual Steve pointed out. This module has the capability to support a minimum of 4 different protocols simultaneously, including TCP/IP (commonly used by web publishers), SRTP (used in Proficy ME), EGD, and Modbus TCP. Properly configuring the module eliminates the need for COMM_REQs. It's important to note that certain Ethernet modules or ports from GEIP and other brands can only handle one protocol at a time, unlike the VersaMax Micro. These are essentially Ethernet to Serial adapters and lack the versatility of true serial ports. Additional Ethernet modules are only necessary if network segregation is required, such as isolating a SCADA from the I/O network. For more information, refer to document GFK-2224.</p>

            <p>Two ladder block functions are provided for performing Modbus TCP read/write operations using the comreq commands. These functions are in XML format, so make sure to change the file extension from .txt to .xml before importing them into the logic/program blocks of the Proficy Machine Edition software. It is important to note that the comreq command requires a sysid and a task to function properly. For detailed instructions on setting up the Modbus TCP communication, refer to the document at http://geplc.com/downloads/Labs/GFS-384 M10 Modbus TCP.pdf. When using PACSystems CPU with an embedded Ethernet interface, the TASK parameter should be set to 65536 (0x10000) to address the CPUâ€™s Ethernet daughterboard.

In Scenario 1, where the RX3i functions as the Server (Slave), simply enable Modbus in the 3i CPU and set the Modbus Address Space Mapping Type to Standard Modbus Mapping on the Settings Tab. The Master device will then poll the 3i for the specified MB addresses. Refer to the GFK document to determine which % memory data type corresponds to each Modbus address. It is recommended to bundle the registers you require into a continuous memory area for efficient reading. This is a straightforward process from the perspective of GE and is how I have set up multiple RX3i machines to communicate with a client.

In Scenario 2, the roles are reversed with the 3i acting as the Client (Master) and the other device as the Server (Slave). In this case, the 3i will be responsible for writing to the server, requiring comm_reqs to be initiated and executed. You will need to set up 2 comm_reqs: the first to establish an MBTCP channel with the server's IP address, and the second to actually write the data once the channel is open.</p>

            <p>Although this thread may be old, the information shared by tearoscarlet regarding TCP read and write for Modbus is still relevant and useful. The process for setting up a Modbus Server is straightforward, but the client implementation can be a bit challenging. It seems to be a holdover from older systems, but using Unity Pro I/O Scanning is a more user-friendly option. However, if you need to extract data from a Modbus TCP device like a meter, tearoscarlet's source code can be a helpful starting point. Adjust and test the code until it functions properly, which is not too difficult. Make sure to have the correct SYSID for your card or CPU position. For multiple meters, it is recommended to utilize multiple channels for a more efficient process: open, read, close, and repeat.</p>

            <p>Indeed, this setup remains highly relevant today. I continue to utilize it in conjunction with power meters that were upgraded to the RX3i model a few years ago. The configuration includes the RX3i CPE305, with the SYSID reflecting the onboard Ethernet port. This setup employs a timer and cyclically polls each meter every 2 to 3 seconds in an up counter manner. In case of any errors, the channel is closed, reopened, and the process restarts. Additionally, at the end of the last day of each month, during the final hour, the meters' registers are cleared to initiate a new cycle. While this setup does not store information beyond a monthly basis, I have other applications that maintain data for each month throughout the year. Simply renaming to XML and importing blocks can facilitate this process. While not without flaws, this setup performs effectively. Best regards.</p>
