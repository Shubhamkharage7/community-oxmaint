                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Good morning, I've encountered two issues with the Tia Portal software. The first problem arises when I attempt to program and receive a notification that the license is missing. Despite trying to run the program as an administrator and adjusting settings, I still couldn't resolve the issue. Additionally, on another computer with the software already installed, there is trouble detecting the PLC. While the software is recognized on my current computer, the same cannot be said for the PLC. I'm seeking solutions for both problems and would greatly appreciate any assistance.</p>

            <p>When encountering strange errors, I highly advise reaching out to Siemens technical support for assistance. Their website, support.industry.siemens.com, is a valuable resource for troubleshooting. When facing a virtual machine issue, consider using bridged mode instead of NAT. However, be cautious as it may still fail to work properly due to selecting the incorrect network interface.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Bridged mode offers the advantage of selecting which adapter to bridge with. In situations where issues arise, I opt to utilize a USB NIC directly connected to the virtual machine while disabling other adapters. This method provides greater control and troubleshooting options.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why am I receiving a notification that the license is missing when trying to program in TIA Portal V14?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The issue of a missing license in TIA Portal V14 can occur due to various reasons, such as license activation not being completed, incorrect license configuration, or software installation issues. It is recommended to double-check the license activation process, ensure the correct license is installed, and verify that the software is running with the necessary permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I troubleshoot the problem of TIA Portal software not detecting the PLC on a specific computer?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: When facing difficulties with the software detecting the PLC, it is advisable to first confirm the hardware connections, check for any driver issues, and ensure proper configuration settings are in place. Additionally, updating the software and drivers to the latest versions, as well as restarting both the computer and PLC, might help resolve the detection issue.</p>
</div>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  What steps can I take if adjusting settings and running the program as an administrator did not resolve the license missing issue in TIA Portal V14?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: If adjusting settings and running the program as an administrator did not fix the license missing problem, you could try reinstalling the software, ensuring all prerequisites are met during installation, and validating the license activation process. Consulting the Siemens technical support team or referring to the software documentation for specific troubleshooting steps could also provide further assistance.</p>
