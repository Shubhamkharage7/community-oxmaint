                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, 

We are interested in utilizing a process instrument that consists of both a sensor and controller. The cost of the controller is approximately five times higher than the cost of the sensor. 

For our application, we need four of these sensors. We are wondering if anyone has experience using a signal commutator that can electronically or mechanically rotate the connections from the sensors to the controller. 

I am open to cycling between sensors 1-5 within a specified time frame. 

Best regards,
PreLC</p>

            <p>It appears there may have been a misunderstanding of the original question. To address this issue, there are several solutions that can be explored.

One option is to utilize the recording functions often found in PLCs. With only 4 sensors in use, it is possible to easily track and record data from these sensors, capturing more information than necessary.

Alternatively, if a PLC is not available, an IPC with RS232/485 converter can be used to connect to a PC's COM or USB port. By developing customized code to interpret the data, the information from the sensors can still be accessed.

For applications requiring high frequency data collection exceeding 10000Hz, an additional Data Acquisition Card may be needed. Typically, a DAC can handle at least 4 channels of data input.

A question raised is why the controller costs only 5 times more than the sensors. Is it possible that these sensors are considered "smart sensors," equipped with internal chips for enhanced functionality?</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a multiplexer for 4-20mA signals, consider using a device that can handle up to 3 discrete inputs or 4 signals with 2 bits. While the model mentioned in the original post may be out of production, you can explore alternatives that offer similar functionality. Reach out to local distributors to inquire about products that meet your requirements. Remember to check for compatibility with the standards of the industry.</p>
