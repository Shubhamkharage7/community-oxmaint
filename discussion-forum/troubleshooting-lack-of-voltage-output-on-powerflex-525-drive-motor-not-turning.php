                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently experiencing an issue with my Powerflex 525 drive where there is a lack of voltage output to the motor. I recently reset the drive to factory defaults and placed stop and safety jumpers for testing. Despite the drive fan operating and the control panel displaying the hz ramp up, there is still no voltage detected at the u v w terminals. Surprisingly, no faults are being displayed.

            <p>FriendlySteaK inquired about a powerflex 525 drive issue where no voltage is reaching the motor. The drive was reset to factory settings for testing, with stop and safety jumpers in place. The drive's fan is running, and the control panel indicates the frequency is ramping up, but there is no voltage at the u v w terminals. Despite no fault codes being displayed, the issue persists. Any ideas on what might be causing this? Your insights are greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>The motor is successfully connected and operational through a separate VFD. Adequate voltage is present at the DC bus, and the controller should trigger a fault if the voltage exceeds or falls below the specified range. The drive is currently operating under default V/Hz control mode. When the start command is activated, the controller shows a ramp-up in hertz, adjusting based on the setting of the onboard potentiometer.</p>

            <p>It seems like there may be an issue with the connection between control and IGBT, or possibly a defective IGBT component. This could be causing an operational problem that needs to be addressed to ensure smooth functioning of the system.Issues with IGBT control can lead to malfunctions in electrical systems, so it's crucial to address any potential disconnect or faulty components promptly.</p>

            <p>If you experience issues with the PF525 drive due to excessive load during startup, it may restrict your output frequency, resembling a faulty motor or drive. Consider adjusting parameter A495 to address this issue. In some cases, both PF525 and 4M drives exhibit erratic behavior when the load is too high for proper operation but not enough to trigger an overload. Try increasing the current limit within parameters A484-A485 to observe any improvements in performance.</p>

            <p>To ensure proper termination, verify that your S1 and S2 jumper are correctly connected. If you clamp onto the insulation, it may give the appearance of being installed but there will be no actual connection. The input functions as a base block, disabling the transistors. Check b006, bit 5 to determine if the S1/2 circuit is active - a high level indicates activity, while a low level means it is not continuous.</p>

            <p>Encountering the same issue, I discovered that the IGBT had no output. I resolved the problem by replacing the power module of the drive. The root cause of the issue was due to the manufacturer from Italy, who designed a system connecting four motors of 1/2 hp each to one VFD 525, 3 hp, without considering the startup current. As a result, the VFD would not last more than three months of operation.</p>

            <p>User adel1961 reported encountering a similar issue and identified that the IGBT had no output. By replacing the power module of the drive, the problem was successfully resolved. The root cause was attributed to the design oversight of connecting four 1/2 hp motors to a single VFD 525 with a capacity of 3 hp. The manufacturer from Italy failed to consider the startup current, resulting in the VFD's lifespan not exceeding three months of operation. To mitigate high startup current, adjusting the startup frequency and ramp speed could be beneficial in prolonging the drive's longevity. Consider this approach as a preventive measure to avoid frequent drive replacements.</p>

            <p>adel1961 mentioned that they encountered a similar issue where the IGBT had no output. They resolved the issue by replacing the power module of the drive. The root cause was attributed to the manufacturer from Italy who designed a system with 4 motors (each 1/2 hp) connected to one VFD 525, rated for 3 hp. The oversight of neglecting the start-up current led to the VFD's premature failure within 3 months of operation. Would you mind elaborating on which specific part was replaced in this scenario?

Upon conducting a test with a multimeter, I placed the positive probe on DC- and the negative probe on U, V, and W. Interestingly, I obtained readings for V and W but not for U. Do you happen to have the part number for the PIM IGBT? Your assistance is highly valued. Thank you.</p>
