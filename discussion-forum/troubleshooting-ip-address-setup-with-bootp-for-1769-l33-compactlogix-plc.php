            <p>Changing the IP settings on a device can be easily done through RSLinx. If the device has already obtained an IP address, it will no longer send out BootP requests. To clear out the IP address, simply power cycle the device. If the device is configured with a static IP, you will need to establish communication on the correct subnet, which may require changing the IP address of your PC. Once communication is established, you can use RSLinx to modify the IP settings.</p>

            <p>If you are unsure of the current IP address, an alternative method is to establish a connection via USB in RSLinx. This can be a helpful solution for troubleshooting network connectivity issues.</p>

            <p>When setting up a device to communicate with another, utilize Wireshark to directly capture and analyze the outgoing packets, revealing its IP address. If unsuccessful, Zenmap can be used for a ping scan. However, without any knowledge of the subnet, the ping scan process may be lengthy. It is recommended to start with Wireshark for more efficient results.</p>

            <p>Charley from Voos recommends using USB to connect through RSLinx if you are unsure of the current IP address. This alternative option is especially handy as Rockwell has incorporated USB connectivity into their modules, making the process even easier.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Question: Why is BOOTP not detecting my 1769-L33 CompactLogix PLC when I try to change its IP address?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: There could be several reasons for this issue, such as network configuration problems, firewall settings, or compatibility issues between the PLC and the BOOTP software.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Question: I disabled the firewall on my Windows 10 system, but BOOTP still couldn't detect the PLC. What else could be causing the problem?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Apart from the firewall, ensure that there are no other security settings or network restrictions blocking the communication between the BOOTP software and the PLC. Also, check if the PLC is properly connected to the network.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Question: Can BOOTP recognize a device that already has an IP address assigned to it?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: BOOTP typically assigns IP addresses to devices that do not have one already. If the device already has a static IP address assigned, BOOTP may not be able to detect it. In such cases, you might need to manually change the IP address on the PLC itself.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. Question: Are there any specific network requirements or settings that need to be configured for BOOTP to work with the 1769-L33 CompactLogix PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Ensure that the network settings on both the PLC and the computer running the BOOTP software are correctly configured, including subnet masks, gateway addresses, and DHCP server settings. Additionally, check</p>
