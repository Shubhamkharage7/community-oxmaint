                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently experiencing difficulties adding an Ethernet module to my project in Studio500 version 34. The equipment in question is a Fredericks Televac EthernetIP MX gateway utilized for communication with vacuum gauges. I downloaded and installed the EDS file provided by the manufacturer with administrative rights. The installation was successful and I can locate the gateway in RS Linx. Using the manufacturer's ipconfig tool, I assigned the desired IP address to the gateway without any issues. However, when I try to add the new Ethernet module in Studio5000 by right-clicking on A1 Ethernet in the Controller Organizer panel, selecting new module, and choosing "Fredericks EthernetIP MX", the program crashes after a 15-20 second loading period. I have reached out to the manufacturer for an updated EDS file, but even after trying it, the issue persists. It seems like the problem might be on my end. I have previously worked on projects using the same device and encountered crashes when trying to access module properties in those projects. Even exporting the module from an older project and importing it into the current one resulted in the same crash. Any assistance on this matter would be highly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Is there a generic ethernet option offered by the vendor that allows you to customize Input, Output, and Config sizes as well as instances? If Studio is crashing on older configured instances, it may indicate corruption within your Studio instance.  Try using it on a different computer running Studio to troubleshoot the issue.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, I installed the January 2024 patches in hopes of resolving the issue, but unfortunately, it did not help. The original EDS file obtained from Fredericks' website triggered approximately 47 warnings during the installation process. However, the updated file they provided installed smoothly without any issues. I plan to test this on another computer to determine if the problem is specific to my Studio installation. Interestingly, I can add other Ethernet modules without any complications, suggesting that the issue is isolated to the Fredericks module. An update: I successfully added the module on a different PC running Studio, indicating that I may need to reinstall it on my original computer.</p>
