                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, 
We've encountered an issue with a couple of servo valves and are looking for any insights on similar occurrences. Following a drop in pressure on 2 servo valves, they quickly returned to their original position, causing the machine to go into fault mode. This is the first time this has happened since the valves were installed 2 years ago. Subsequently, the MSO tags for both valves are displaying MSO.ER 11. According to the manual for the 1756-M02AS, this indicates that the axis is not properly configured. It's puzzling how this could happen after the machine has been operating smoothly for 2 years. My research suggests that re-downloading the program may resolve the issue, but I won't be able to attempt this until Monday. Has anyone encountered a similar situation before? Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Following a drop in pressure on two servo valves, they swiftly returned to their default position, causing the machine to go into fault. This issue may be related to the loop gain, which is influenced by pressure levels. It appears that a following-error occurred before the system abruptly moved to the home position. It is worth investigating if there is a following-error trap that disengages the servo loops in such situations. Additionally, is this drop in pressure a common issue or is it considered abnormal? It may be possible that a simple reset could resolve the issue.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Avoid downloading the program as it may not solve the issue and only provide a false sense of resolution. The MSO error typically occurs when attempting to activate the servo while the axis is in shutdown mode, faulted, or not properly configured. If in shutdown mode, you will need to programmatically issue a MASR. In case of a fault, a MAFR should be issued. If the axis is not configured, it is likely that the motion group has not synced or there are communication issues, or possibly a missing Line voltage.</p>
