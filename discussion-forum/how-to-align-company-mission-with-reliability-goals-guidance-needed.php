            <p>Currently, we are focused on tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure our progress. These KPIs are used to assess our current status, compare against industry benchmarks, and strive for "World Class" status. Our main priority is enhancing our hydraulic systems by implementing an oil analysis program, transitioning to glass media filters and air breathers, upgrading fittings and hoses, and implementing a cohesive identification system. Essentially, we are seeking a comprehensive strategy that integrates all these improvements at every level of the organization. This holistic approach will be invaluable in justifying significant investments aimed at improving reliability.</p>

            <p>Dwilken - I believe what you are seeking is a way to measure overall maintenance performance. Utilizing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as MTBF (mean time between failures) and MTTR (mean time to repair) can help showcase improvement in maintenance processes. It is also crucial to track maintenance costs, including labor, purchases, and inventory value, to justify any enhancements. To align with World Class standards, consider using OEE (overall equipment effectiveness) as another valuable KPI, which is typically more production-oriented but can still provide insight on engineering performance. By incorporating OEE into your presentation, you can effectively tie your metrics to the company's overarching goals. Analyzing major and minor stops within the OEE calculation will help establish this connection. - Mike.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. How can we align our company's mission with our reliability goals and objectives?
- To align your company's mission with reliability goals, start by clearly defining your mission statement and identifying how reliability contributes to achieving that mission. Ensure that reliability goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What are some strategies to ensure that reliability goals are in sync with the overall mission of the company?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Strategies include involving key stakeholders in the goal-setting process, communicating the importance of reliability across all levels of the organization, integrating reliability metrics into performance evaluations, and fostering a culture that prioritizes reliability.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Can you provide guidance on creating visual resources such as flow charts or Gantt charts to illustrate the alignment of company mission with reliability goals?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - When creating visual resources, start by mapping out your company's mission statement, core values, and strategic objectives. Then, identify specific reliability goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) that support those objectives. Use tools like flow charts or Gantt charts to visually represent the alignment and progress towards achieving reliability goals.</p>
