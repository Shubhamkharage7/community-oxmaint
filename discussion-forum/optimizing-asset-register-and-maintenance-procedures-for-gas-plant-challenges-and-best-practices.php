                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello Members, 

We are currently undergoing a PM optimization process for a 25-year-old gas plant by reviewing existing maintenance procedures. During this process, we have identified minor discrepancies between assets in Maximo and assets in the field due to various upgrades over the years. As part of our PMO process, we have initiated a validation of the Asset Register and Functional Hierarchy in Maximo by comparing them with field data, P&IDs, instrumentation, and electrical documents. 

While conducting this validation, we have encountered certain challenges due to the absence of specific policies. These challenges include: 
1. Asset Registration - determining which equipment/instruments should be added as assets (e.g., block valves, hand valves, interconnecting power cables, DCS cards). Are there any industry guidelines or best practices for asset registration in this sector? 
2. Maintainable Equipment - establishing selection criteria for items subject to maintenance. Are there any industry-specific guidelines or best practices in the oil and gas field? Different industries may have varying approaches to selection and registration. Are there any value-added criteria or best practices available for consideration?

We appreciate any valuable insights or inputs you can provide on these matters. 

Thank you, 
KJAP</p>

            <p>Hello KJAP, best of luck with your as-built walkdown! Many companies face configuration management issues similar to yours. It seems like you are working on the as-built plant configuration project alongside your PMO project. To ensure accuracy in the PM program's asset list, every PM/JP should be directly linked to the asset(s) involved in the work or testing, or being monitored for conditions. To achieve this, create dummy Equipment IDs starting with a "+" sign following the existing unit convention. The database administrator can easily identify dummy IDs with this prefix. The new Equipment IDs should follow the same structure as those in Maximo, such as "3ABC-M1A" for a motor related to a pump referenced as "3ABC-P1A." After completing the PMO project, add the newly identified assets to Maximo's equipment list if they require preventive maintenance.

Gas and oil industries commonly employ risk-ranking to prioritize failure consequences within each unit. Assets are assigned a risk priority number based on detection, likelihood, and consequences of failure. This process generates a Pareto chart highlighting assets with higher risks for more maintenance attention, while lower ranked assets receive less or none. Various failure effects to consider include personnel hazards, throughput losses, startup delays, quality impacts, process disruptions, and corrective maintenance costs.

Thank you, and happy optimizing!</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Larry, for your prompt response. I appreciate your feedback on both points, but I require further clarification regarding Item#1. My question pertains to the process of establishing assets in Maximo or registering them within the system. We manage various equipment categories such as pumps, compressors, and heat exchangers, all of which are treated as assets due to our regular maintenance practices. However, there are additional categories like Hand Valves, such as a 5" Manual Gate Valve in a critical heat exchanger inlet line, that are not currently tagged in the P&ID and therefore not registered in Maximo. The absence of this crucial information poses a risk to production output as any issues with these unregistered assets could lead to unplanned downtime. It is essential to establish a clear policy based on business risk to designate such items as assets in the CMMS. I am in search of best practices and guidelines specific to this industry scenario. Regarding Item#2, I agree with your suggestion. Thank you once again for your assistance.</p>

            <p>In response to your inquiries, it is crucial to accurately register all equipment in the CMMS system to ensure a comprehensive asset register. At our facility, we have taken the initiative to tag hand/manual/block valves, cables, and DCS cards that are not typically identified in P&IDs. Additionally, we have advised our project team to tag all equipment, such as fans and small motors, that are not typically labeled in P&IDs for maintenance and asset register purposes. Do you have a formal process for requesting changes to the asset register, and is it integrated with the plant change request procedure? Is there a structured equipment hierarchy in your CMMS, linking components like manual valves to their parent equipment tags (e.g., heat exchanger) and DCS cards to their parent tags? Have you included pipings and DCS components in the CMMS database? Secondly, it is imperative to categorize equipment into maintainable groups to streamline maintenance activities when one piece of equipment is offline.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, Mr. Josh. I agree that labeling all items as assets would be beneficial. However, the definition of what qualifies as an asset can be quite broad, whether it be a 1/2" valve or a 4" valve. It is important to establish a clear policy or guideline to set boundaries for asset selection. Do you have any best practices or a policy template to help with this process? Currently, our CMMS hierarchy is organized based on function, but some disciplines, such as electrical, have their own equipment hierarchy for tracking purposes. It may be a good idea to incorporate an asset register change form into our process.</p>

            <p>Inquiry by Josh: How should equipment and instruments like block valves or hand valves, interconnecting power cables, and DCS cards be registered as assets in the industry? Are there any guidelines or best practices for asset registration? 

Dear Josh, I will address your question in parts. 

1. Many Operation & Maintenance personnel tend to overlook asset IDs and rarely use them for work orders or requests in the CMMS system. Instead, they rely on plant tags from P&IDs or other drawings. Although there is a field in the CMMS system for Asset #, it is often not mandatory for data entry. However, affixing asset ID tags is a requirement, and routine asset verification is recommended. When retiring or upgrading an asset, certain procedures, such as partial or complete retirement forms, should be followed. 

2. The approach to identifying equipment like block valves and DCS modules in the CMMS system varies between sites. This discrepancy may stem from the absence of unique equipment tag numbers in project/vendor drawings or the lack of maintenance history requirements for certain equipment. Nevertheless, these entities can be added if the need arises later on. 

3. Asset IDs are typically assigned by Assets Accounting personnel for capital equipment, which meets specific criteria outlined in company guidelines (GI 22.008). This includes items that are physically identifiable, used in productive capacity, provide benefits for over a year, and have certain direct material cost thresholds.</p>

            <p>Hello KJAP, it seems like we are in agreement on this topic. I am currently working with clients in the shipping and oil & gas industries. Despite having no prior site experience, I have been able to successfully carry out our work using P&ID and other reference documents. Based on my experience, I would like to provide some insights on building an asset hierarchy. To begin, it is crucial to start with the system, ensuring that system groups, systems, and sub-systems are properly identified. Once this is done, you can then focus on the main equipment that serves a specific function, such as a heat exchanger for cooling or heating. It is essential to register instruments/alarms as they play a critical role in the functioning of the main equipment, thus requiring a maintenance plan. Regarding valves, I agree with Josh on only registering valves sized 2" and above, as smaller valves typically do not have a maintenance plan. When it comes to electrical components, we only register up to lighting panels and junction boxes, while HSE equipment like detectors/alarms, fire hydrants, and monitors are also included. Do you already have unique identifiers or tag numbers for each asset in place, or is this part of your current work? I came across a discussion from 2005 that mentioned a specific approach to writing job plans/maintenance tasks and referred to files called "Planner's guide" and "writer's guide." If you have access to these files, would you be able to share them? Thank you. Albert.</p>

            <p>quote: Albert_P originally stated his agreement with Josh on restricting valve registration to those 2" and larger. He pointed out that maintenance plans for smaller valves are not practical. Electrical components are only registered up to lighting panels and junction boxes, while HSE includes detectors&alarms, fire hydrants, and monitors. Albert, thank you for sharing your insights. Junction Boxes (JBs) are included in your plans. Do you have preventive maintenance (PM) plans for these JB units? When it comes to small valves, they should be included if they are critical. For instance, a 1/2" valve from a certain supplier may have frequent failures. In such cases, it is important to register them, even if they do not have a designated PM plan. Operators can raise work requests (WR) against the parent entity of the 1/2" valve (or against a dummy entity) with a request to create a new entity. Planners or Site CMMS coordinators can then create a new entity for the valve before converting the WR into a Work Order. Regards.</p>
