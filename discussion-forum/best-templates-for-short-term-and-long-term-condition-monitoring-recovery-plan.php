            <p>For those looking to handle data internally, consider hiring two skilled data experts who are eager to learn and can be trained to become analysts. Initially, your current analysts may focus on analyzing more data but collecting less, while the new data collectors develop their analytical skills. As the new analysts gain experience, the senior analysts can return to the field. If you require prompt analytical assistance, reaching out to a trusted company for an analyst may be the best solution. Don't hesitate to seek outside help when needed.</p>
