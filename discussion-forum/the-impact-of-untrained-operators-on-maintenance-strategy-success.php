                    <p>Hello everyone, Companies invest a significant amount of money in developing advanced maintenance strategies to boost production efficiency and mitigate risks. They employ experienced technicians to carry out regular maintenance tasks. However, there is a concerning issue where operators are often operating the latest equipment without any formal qualifications or training. This lack of expertise in operating equipment can undermine the efforts put into developing a maintenance strategy. With operations responsible for a significant portion of plant reliability issues, should companies reconsider the practice of assigning untrained operators to handle sophisticated equipment? What are your thoughts and experiences regarding the skill levels of operators? Share your insights and experiences in the comments section. Cheers - Gary</p>

            <p>It is unfair to criticize operators based on vague and unsubstantiated rants. Having formal qualifications does not necessarily guarantee proven skills in operating the latest equipment. Are companies releasing plant operators to work with sophisticated equipment without proper training requirements? It is important to specify the type of sophisticated equipment being referred to. How can we determine if the claim of being "sophisticated" actually means poorly designed, user-unfriendly, and ineffective?</p>

            <p>Hello Buzz, I appreciate your response. I want to clarify that my previous comments were not meant to criticize operators. I have had the privilege of working with some highly skilled operating staff throughout my career. However, my experiences in the UK, New Zealand, and Australia have shown me that there are varying levels of operator competencies in these countries. It seems that many businesses do not prioritize operator skills. In the UK, there was a national vocational qualification program in process operations that aimed to teach essential concepts like pressures, temperatures, and flows. This initiative was a step in the right direction.

Imagine letting someone drive your car without any formal training- it just wouldn't make sense. Similarly, no matter how advanced the machinery may be, the key factor is the training and competency of the operator. It is essential for businesses to invest in proper training for their operators to ensure safe and efficient operations. Thank you - Gary</p>

            <p>One common issue highlighted by Gary is the inadequate quality of training provided to operators. Gary's concerns about operator training are valid and relatable. I have personally seen operators being recruited and given minimal plant induction before being entrusted with overseeing a high-value operation. It is clear that some companies do not prioritize operator skills, placing the blame on the companies rather than the operators themselves. It is crucial for companies to recognize the essential requirements for effectively running their plants.</p>

            <p>Are Gary and Bob collaborating to offer services related to industrial reliability? It's important to consider the importance of proper training in any industry, just like you wouldn't let someone drive your car without formal instruction. Gary raises concerns about the quality of training for operators, but the specific issues, consequences, and solutions remain unclear. It's crucial to address these questions to improve the overall training process and ensure safety in the workplace.</p>

            <p>Hello Buzz, It seems like you are lightyears ahead, and if I were looking to sell something, I would head to eBay! (ha-ha) "What is the core issue at hand, what are the repercussions, and what solutions can be proposed to tackle this 'challenge'?" The main issue I want to delve into is the disparity between maintenance-driven reliability and reliability in operations. From my observations, companies tend to prioritize maintenance reliability over operational reliability. "What are the implications" - Neglecting either leads to the same outcomes: unscheduled downtime, heightened safety risks, increased business expenses, and so on. "What solutions can be suggested to address this 'challenge'?" While I may not have a concrete solution for operational reliability issues, I believe at the very least there should be a focus on educating and engaging operating staff. This would enable operational personnel to grasp the implications of their actions, or lack thereof, on equipment reliability. I agree with Bob, as he raises the issue of the quality of training that operators receive, although there are other factors to consider. Perhaps my post should have been titled "operating for reliability." Have others encountered challenges with operational reliability, and if so, how have they been resolved? Cheers - Gary</p>

            <p>One common issue I have observed with grinder operations is a lack of training, leading to reliability problems. Operators, driven by the amount of work they need to complete, tend to push for maximum output without proper knowledge on equipment maintenance. While they have some understanding of quality standards, they lack the expertise to achieve them efficiently. This results in premature failure of grinding wheels and belts, as operators often force products into the grinder to work quickly, causing uneven wear, heat generation, and damage to the stones. The high speeds at which the stones travel amplify even the smallest irregularities, leading to excessive vibration. As a consequence, frequent downtime is required for replacing stones and belts, along with the necessary rebalancing. A comprehensive training program on operating reliability is crucial to prevent such issues and ensure smooth operations.</p>

            <p>Gary, I find the current trend of incorporating tradespeople into dual roles as both operators and maintainers to be quite intriguing. This approach not only enhances their skill level, but also fosters a greater sense of "mechanical regard" for the machinery they work with. By having operations personnel take responsibility for equipment maintenance, we are creating a workforce that is more well-rounded and efficient.

One way to achieve this is by encouraging operators with a mechanical aptitude to pursue a trade qualification. While this strategy has proven successful in some cases, it may not always be feasible, especially when dealing with older operators who are content with their current role and are not keen on further training. However, a new generation of operators is emerging – younger, more enthusiastic, and eager to upskill. Many of these individuals possess higher aptitude levels, often with high school diplomas, making them ideal candidates for the mechanical/operational hybrid roles we are aiming for. This shift in demographics holds promise for the future of our workforce. Mike.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I am new to this field at the age of 30. I am involved in managing reliability programs at multiple plants and working closely with operators. I collaborate with on-site Electricians and maintenance workers. I have noticed issues within all groups. Gary, you are correct in pointing out that operators sometimes hastily push the start button when a motor or equipment stops working, leading to potential disasters. Rather than investigating the cause of the shutdown, they continue to push the button until something goes wrong. This results in other trades being called in to fix a problem that could have been easily resolved with proper training and initiative. Wishing everyone a safe and enjoyable holiday season. Stay safe!</p>
