                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Within a 5380 series controller, I have implemented logic to track the duration of events by capturing the start and end times and calculating the elapsed time. I use a GSV instruction triggered by a one-shot to retrieve the date and time from the PLC's Real-Time Clock (RTC). By dividing the timer's accumulated value by 1000, I convert the duration into seconds for display. However, I am facing an issue where the division by 1000 rounds down the value, for example, 22999 rounds down to 22 when using a DINT data type as the destination for the DIV instruction.

My concern lies with the accuracy of the PLC's RTC and the GSV instruction. Will the seconds value read from the RTC be rounded as well? I suspect the seconds value is derived from the microseconds value of the RTC, causing discrepancies in the calculated elapsed time compared to the timer's .ACC value. Despite GSV occasionally displaying the correct elapsed time, there are instances where a one-second discrepancy occurs, aligning with the rounding of the timer's .ACC DINT value.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When performing integer division in ControlLogix, keep in mind that it truncates rather than rounding down. This means that the remainder is not included in the result, only the quotient. If you need to find the remainder, you can use the Modulo (MOD) command or include a REAL tag in your arguments.

For those using a 5380 series controller, the firmware should support math operations on LINT datatypes. This allows you to calculate elapsed microseconds by getting the CurrentValue of WallClockTime at the start and end of an event and subtracting the end value from the start value. No need for an RTO in this scenario.

The Seconds value of Wall Clock Time is not rounded; it increases by 1 when the Microseconds value increases by 1,000,000.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback, Ken. I considered comparing the two GSV instructions as you suggested, but there may be interruptions during the process. Simply calculating the start and finish times and performing math on them could lead to inaccuracies due to potential pauses in the process. I want to avoid any issues that may arise from rounding values, such as when dividing 22999 by 1000 resulting in 22 with a remainder of 999 potentially being rounded up to 23. It is crucial that the WallClockTimes accurately depict the start and finish times of the process in relation to the RTO. While testing the code, I have observed that the WallClockTimes are precise, but the calculated elapsed time has occasionally been off by a second. Knowing that the seconds value will only increment when the microseconds value reaches 1,000,000 provides clarity and reassurance in the accuracy of the calculations.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Could discrepancies in calculated elapsed time between the RTC's seconds value and the timer's accumulated value be caused by the RTC's microseconds value being used for time calculation?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: It is possible that discrepancies in elapsed time calculations could arise from differences in the resolution or precision of the timer's accumulated value and the RTC's time representation. Further investigation into the timing mechanisms and data handling may be needed to address this issue.</p>
