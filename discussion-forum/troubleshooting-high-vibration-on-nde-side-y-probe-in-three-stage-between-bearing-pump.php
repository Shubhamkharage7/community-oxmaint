                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Our three-stage between bearing pump features a first stage with double suction and single discharge. To measure shaft vibration, both DE and NDE side probes are installed at a 45-degree angle from the top. Currently, we are experiencing high online vibration on the NDE side Y probe, while the other proximity probes are showing steady values. Despite checking bearings, clearance, rotor runout, and alignment - all of which were found to be in good condition - the high vibration on the NDE side Y probe persists. Even after replacing the probe with a new one, the issue remains unresolved. The pump was removed and sent to the vendor workshop for a major overhaul and then reinstalled, but the vibration behavior persisted during commissioning. Any insights on what could be causing the ongoing high vibration on the NDE side probe would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Suresh Karunakaran.</p>
