                    <p>Hello, I recently acquired a storage unit at an auction and found these 5 Honeywell brand parts inside. As someone who is not a mechanic, I am seeking advice on the best way to sell these parts. I initially tried selling them on eBay, sold 3 items, and they were shipped. However, my account was restricted by eBay for breaking policies related to providing invoices for the parts. I provided the auction house invoice, but it was declined, and I am no longer able to sell on the platform.

The parts included in the storage unit are: 
- Honeywell M9484F1007R
- Honeywell M7800L1012C
- Honeywell 7061A1053PG
- Honeywell D1AJ0ww0C7035A1023

Any information or guidance on the best way to sell these parts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>In your burner control system, you have essential components like a damper actuator, ignition controller, flame sensor, HMI, and an upgraded flame sensor known as a purple peeper. Perhaps these devices are subject to regulations governing control equipment? Although I lack knowledge of American legislation, in Canada, it appears that you can easily purchase and sell these items, provided that the installer holds proper credentials like a Red Seal Gas fitter license.</p>

As someone with no mechanical background, I am seeking advice on the best way to sell these items. I initially tried selling them on eBay and had success with three items, but my account got restricted when I was about to receive payment. eBay cited policy violations and requested invoices for the parts, which I provided from the auction house. Unfortunately, eBay declined the invoices and barred me from selling any further. Any insights on what policy may have been breached would be appreciated. It is possible that the issue stemmed from shipping-related policies, such as not providing tracking information or discrepancies in the selected shipping method."</p>

            <p>According to SHB79's experience, using UPS instead of USPS for shipping resulted in potential restrictions on their account. The decision to restrict an account may depend on whether eBay was aware of the change in shipping method or if the buyer reported an issue. To resolve any restrictions, it is recommended to contact eBay and inquire about the situation to possibly have the restriction lifted.</p>

            <p>arpus4KM inquired about the policy violation that led to the restriction of their eBay account. Even though it may not be related to the items they sold, it could be linked to shipping practices such as lack of tracking information or mismatched shipping methods. The user was not provided with specific details on the policy breach, but they received an email stating that their account was restricted due to violating eBay policies and posing a risk to the community. Despite the frustration, the user was informed that their selling privileges will remain indefinitely blocked. eBay emphasized the importance of maintaining a safe marketplace by enforcing such restrictions and prohibiting restricted users from creating new accounts or selling items. Additionally, existing accounts associated with restricted users may also face suspension. While the user can still make purchases, any requests to reinstate selling privileges will not be addressed.</p>
