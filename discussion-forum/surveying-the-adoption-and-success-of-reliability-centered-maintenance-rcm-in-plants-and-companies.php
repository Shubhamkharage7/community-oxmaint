            <p>We are currently in the process of implementing plant-wide Remote Control Maintenance (RCM) strategies. While there are both positive and negative aspects to this initiative, we have noticed that some elements appear to be included just for the sake of it, offering no real value to the overall process. Our maintenance teams have dubbed it "remote control maintenance" and are not fully supportive of it, representing a major challenge that we are facing.</p>

            <p>In recent conversations, I came across the acronym RCM, which some refer to as Resource Consuming Monster. Despite initial perceptions, RCM actually presents a highly effective maintenance approach centered around failure modes. Surprisingly, many industries beyond aviation are hesitant to embrace RCM, potentially due to a lack of understanding or challenges in implementation. As a result, various modified versions of RCM have emerged. Interestingly, aviation regulations mandate the implementation of RCM prior to aircraft operations.</p>

            <p>Why is RCM often misunderstood as Remote Control Maintenance? This misconception can hinder efforts to properly identify equipment failure modes and develop a targeted maintenance strategy. By implementing RCM, organizations can gain valuable insights into equipment failures and ensure a more thorough and efficient maintenance approach.</p>

            <p>In the field of power generation, I have observed the initial stage of identifying preventive maintenance tasks required to tackle all possible failure modes. While this is a straightforward process, the challenge arises when there is an imbalance between the allocated work hours and the available workforce. It is essential to streamline these tasks to make them more manageable and efficient, ultimately reducing man-hours. For instance, I once encountered a situation where over 400 preventive maintenance tasks were established for infrared inspections on Motor Control Centers, one for each breaker. However, this number was successfully reduced to just 4 tasks, one for each unit. Achieving this level of optimization requires time and skilled personnel. Despite being effective for critical equipment, implementing a comprehensive maintenance strategy must also take into account the associated costs.</p>

            <p>Initially, the maintenance team perceived Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) as a way to transfer their hard-earned knowledge to less experienced, lower-paid workers, potentially diminishing the demand for highly skilled maintenance personnel. The key to overcoming their concerns was providing them with adequate time and training to understand the advantages and positive outcomes of the program. While their skepticism lessened once they grasped the benefits, it is important to remain cautious as their doubts could resurface based on how they are treated.</p>

            <p>Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) is often dismissed as a mere myth in maintenance practices, but I successfully applied it on a small scale for an electric motor. The results were remarkable, as the preventive maintenance requirements were significantly reduced after a thorough review of all available data. RCM is a valuable strategy for transforming your current maintenance approach into more efficient and effective activities.

Through an assessment of the electric motor, I identified numerous ineffective maintenance practices that were rectified by implementing RCM-defined strategies. The client was so pleased with the outcome that they have decided to apply these principles to their other equipment as well. With the guidance of an experienced facilitator well-versed in asset equipment, we were able to achieve a successful RCM implementation, drawing upon industry best practices for reference.

By debunking the myth surrounding RCM and embracing its potential, we have revolutionized our maintenance mindset and paved the way for more streamlined and effective procedures.</p>

            <p>Many leading oil and gas companies like Shell, BP, and Exxon Mobil have adopted Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Additionally, major power companies like EDF and China Light & Power, prominent aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus, and various defense forces such as the UK, US, Australian Air Force, and Navy, as well as certain armies, utilize RCM. If you are interested in seeing quantified benefits, Mowbray's RCM II book includes a comprehensive appendix on the topic. It is common for readers not to comment on posts discussing RCM implementation, as clients often prefer to keep their statistics confidential. This does not indicate that RCM is not being implemented successfully, as suggested in your interpretation.</p>

            <p>If RCM has indeed been widely adopted, how did organizations address the challenge of balancing the increased manhours required for preventive maintenance (PM) tasks compared to available craft manhours? While consolidating PMs may help with coordination, it may not significantly reduce the overall time spent on equipment maintenance.</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, there will be a decrease in preventive maintenance (PM) and an increase in predictive maintenance (PdM) activities for specific motors. We are eagerly awaiting the results of this change after one year. I hope to create a case study based on this implementation to share with others in the future.</p>

            <p>Josh, in response to your question about how to handle the increase in PM manhours compared to available craft manhours due to RCM, it's important to distinguish between truth and propaganda. Drawing from my own experience and referencing experts like Moubray, it's been shown that total PM+CM hours can actually decrease by 25-40% with a well-executed RCM process. Additionally, uptime can increase by 1-5%, and there can be a reduction of 10% or more in Process Safety events. RCM is not just about selling a product or software; it's about improving reliability. While I personally believe in its effectiveness, ultimately the decision is yours to make.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It seems that a conflict arises when RCM results in assigning more PM manhours than there are available people. Some argue that PMs do not increase and total PM+CM manhours actually decrease post-RCM implementation. Ron, what could be the reason for your PM manhours exceeding the available workforce post-RCM? Apart from an increase in the number of PMs, is it possible that your organization had a lean workforce before RCM? Or perhaps your PM approach pre-RCM was not comprehensive enough? Could it be that your list of failure modes is too extensive and exceeds what is actually needed? These factors may be contributing to the discrepancy observed in manhours post-RCM.</p>
