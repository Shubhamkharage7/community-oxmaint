This process can help resolve any errors or glitches you may be experiencing with the software.</p>

            <p>Following up on this thread, I recently encountered an issue with the "Rockwell Automation CM Runtime" (also known as "CodeMeter Runtime Kit") after my computer crashed due to working in hot environments. It took some time to troubleshoot before identifying the problem. If you do not have the RSLogix installation tools, you can download the CodeMeter Runtime Kit separately from the Rockwell Automation website. Cheers, Vlad.</p>

            <p>To activate the license in CodeMeter, follow these steps. Begin by opening the CodeMeter Control Center and importing the license. For detailed instructions, visit the Rockwell website at https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/626695. If you encounter issues while importing, try restoring the CodeMeter activation using the file UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU. Simply open the CodeMeter Control Center, click on File, then Import License, and select the file located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockwell Software\FactoryTalk Activation\Tools. If the import fails, adjust the file properties by unchecking the Read-only option under Properties. Don't forget to click Apply and then try importing the license again.</p>

            <p>Geospark pointed out a recurring issue with Logix Designer requiring CodeMeter security service to be running in order to function properly. For those experiencing the Error 263Access Level: TechConnect, the official fix can be found under reference number 626695 in Studio 5000. It seems CodeMeter was imposed on users without their consent, raising questions about its necessity for software activation and why it falls under an access level like TechConnect. Activation problems are typically considered part of "free" support, so the confusion remains.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When I originally posted it as "Access Level: TechConnect," that was the designation at the time. However, upon revisiting the link, it now shows that it has been changed to "ID:BF18556| Access Levels: EveryoneCodeMeterAct: CmActLicence Error 263." This change may be attributed to the evolution of CodeMeter from solely a project protection tool for Studio 5000 to a new license type (wibu) that has replaced the original Flexera license (lic). With the inclusion of licensing Activations for RA software products, certain CodeMeter-related articles have possibly been downgraded to "Access Levels: Everyone" in line with their free Activations support policy. It seems that some articles have been changed from "Access Level" to "Access Levels" for a singular article, which may be a point of frustration for some individuals.</p>

To simplify the process, users can open the CodeMeter Control Center and install the license directly from the Rockwell website. The steps to restore the CodeMeter activation are as follows: navigate to Rockwell's website, import the license file UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU in the CodeMeter Control Center, and follow troubleshooting steps if the file does not import initially. This information was easily found through a quick Google search, resolving the issue promptly.</p>

            <p>I want to express my sincere gratitude to abcseabee for sharing this helpful tip. As a newcomer to posting on forums, I found their suggestion to be incredibly useful. By simply opening the CodeMeter Control Center and installing the license from the Rockwell Website, I was able to easily resolve my issue.

For those facing a similar situation, here is a step-by-step solution to restore the CodeMeter activation using the UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU file. Start by opening the CodeMeter Control Center, then navigate to File --> Import License. Locate the file UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU in the C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockwell Software\FactoryTalk Activation\Tools directory and import it. If you encounter any issues with importing the file, make sure to adjust the file properties by unchecking the Read-only box.

Personally, I can attest to the effectiveness of abcseabee's method, as it successfully resolved my problem. I am truly grateful for their assistance and the amazing support provided by this forum. Thank you to abcseabee and the informative content found on this website.</p>
