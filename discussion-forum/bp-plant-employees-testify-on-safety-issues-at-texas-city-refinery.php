                    <p>According to a report on KRISTV.com, BP employees testified before a safety and management oversight panel regarding the company's Texas City refinery, where a tragic explosion claimed the lives of 15 workers in March. The workers revealed that the refinery's equipment is outdated and in need of maintenance, contradicting BP's claims of modernization. Machinist Lloyd Jewell described the equipment as "old, worn out, and antiquated," likening it to a 1950 Edsel rather than a more modern 1999 Taurus. These revelations highlight the importance of investing in maintenance to ensure safety and efficiency in industrial plants.</p>

            <p>Having supplied instrumentation to the BP Texas City plant for nearly three decades, I can confidently say that I have always felt safe within its premises. However, my experiences in other facilities like Dow, Union Carbide, and Bayer along the Gulf Coast have left me cautious. Currently undergoing a significant retrofit and implementing new safety measures, the Texas City facility is taking proactive steps to enhance its safety standards. While all petrochemical plants pose inherent risks, it is crucial for the industry to learn from tragedies and prioritize safety. My thoughts and prayers are with the families who have suffered losses. It is my hope that other facilities will follow BP's example and prioritize safety to prevent future incidents.</p>

            <p>Following a recent incident, individuals are quick to focus on the negative aspects. Having reviewed the interim report, I have now obtained the Final Report which was released on December 9. Similar to the interim report, the Final Report highlights the importance of proper Raffinate splitter startup procedures and the application of knowledge and skills. The application of skills and knowledge is not just a technical concern, but a crucial management issue. This includes areas such as startup/shutdown procedures, safety protocols, training programs, and the enforcement of rules and responsibilities. Proper management of these aspects is essential for ensuring smooth operations and overall safety.</p>

            <p>A common issue I have observed is the absence of established infrastructure within companies. With each new ownership change, there is a tendency for management to start from scratch, leading to a blurring of standard operating procedures. This ambiguity increases the likelihood of important details being overlooked and falling through the cracks. This inconsistency in processes is a concern that I constantly keep in mind.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazardous Investigation Board recently rebuked BP Texas refinery for neglecting mechanical integrity oversight, leading to a devastating fire in July 2005. The fire was triggered by a mistake made by a BP contractor, JV Industrial Companies, who unknowingly replaced two elbows from a heat exchanger with different types of steel. This error caused the carbon steel elbows to crack under high temperatures, releasing hydrogen gases and sparking the fire. The board highlighted the importance of conducting x-ray testing on pipes to ensure they can withstand such conditions. It also criticized BP Texas City refinery for lacking procedures that require material identification tests during equipment maintenance, leading to hazardous system modifications.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Terry, for sharing this information. The recent tower explosion incident, similar to others in modern times, was caused by a failure in a hidden function - the high-level switch. The malfunctioning level indicator also played a role in the incident, along with the failure of a level switch on the blow down tower. Early reports from the Buncefield explosion suggest similar initial causes of failure. It is disheartening that even after 30 years since the original RCM report and almost a decade since Moubray's paper on streamlined RCM dangers, incidents like this still occur. The lack of accountability and ignorance that lead to such situations is truly appalling. I sincerely hope those responsible are held fully accountable. Best regards.</p>

            <p>It is truly disheartening to see that even 30 years after the initial RCM report, and nearly a decade after Moubray's warning about the risks of streamlined RCM, issues like this still persist. It is a shame that despite the importance of RCM implementation, criticism is directed towards streamlined RCM without considering if any RCM practices were in place to begin with.</p>

            <p>While I don't subscribe to the idea that "something is better than nothing" in terms of asset maintenance, I want to clarify that my intention was not to criticize streamliners. I am not necessarily advocating for Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). Moubray's influential paper titled "The Case Against Streamlined RCM" warned about the risks of asset failures and their potential impact on businesses. Despite the publication of this paper and the original RCM report 30 years ago, there are still individuals who lack a solid understanding of asset maintenance fundamentals. The importance of effective asset maintenance and the consequences of neglecting it are widely known. It is disheartening, especially considering the preventable tragedies that may occur due to inadequate maintenance practices. I have included the article for reference, although I may not agree with all of its points.</p>

            <p>A Review Reveals Safety Issues at BP's Texas City Plant 
According to an investigation by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB), budget cuts and a lack of leadership were factors contributing to significant safety issues at BP's Texas City plant, where a fatal explosion occurred in March 2005. The CSB's preliminary findings highlighted that BP management was aware of maintenance, spending, and infrastructure concerns well before the tragic incident that claimed the lives of 15 individuals and left over 170 injured.

The CSB noted that outdated equipment designs were not addressed and there were notable shortcomings in preventive maintenance practices at the plant. Interestingly, an external audit conducted by BP in 2003 already highlighted the subpar condition of the plant's infrastructure and assets, describing a "checkbook mentality" within the organization.

Furthermore, the CSB pointed out that the training staff at the Texas City plant was significantly reduced over the years, with a notable decrease in the training department budget. This revealed a concerning trend of neglect towards safety and maintenance practices at the facility.</p>

Eva Rowe, who lost her parents in the explosion, is determined to seek justice and make a difference by holding BP accountable. She believes that taking a settlement and walking away will not honor her parents' memory. Her attorney, Brent Coon, plans to highlight how budget cuts, lack of training, and management's negligence led to the tragic accident. Recent findings by the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board suggest that BP was aware of maintenance issues prior to the blast but failed to address them. Despite BP accepting responsibility for the incident, Rowe hopes to achieve justice for all affected by the tragedy and make refineries a safer workplace for everyone.</p>

            <p>Greetings everyone, I want to discuss BP's internal maintenance strategy known as a common maintenance strategy. This strategy involves a set of rules and tools used to evaluate and carry out maintenance tasks. Despite having a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) tool in place, the challenge lies in its underutilization or lack of expertise by BP employees, leading to overlooked recommendations from consultants. This can contribute to numerous minor incidents that often go unreported. Nevertheless, BP strives to prioritize safety in a high-risk industry.</p>

            <p>One crucial question to consider is: Who was accountable for safeguarding the integrity of the pressure boundary in the system failure? Identifying the specific individual in charge of this responsibility is crucial. If no individual can be pinpointed, then the onus falls on senior management and the board. Holding senior management and the board legally accountable for intentional negligence could potentially drive positive change. This accountability factor could serve as a powerful motivator for ensuring better oversight.</p>

            <p>Hello Ron, in Canada, individuals can face personal accountability and fines of up to CND$100,000 or up to 25 years in prison. The UK has laws related to "Corporate killing," but there has not been a successful prosecution to date. However, there are ongoing discussions about strengthening these laws. Recently, there were unsuccessful prosecutions in a case involving a train crash, which included the former CEO of a rail infrastructure company, the head of a maintenance contracting company, and engineers. This trend also exists in two states of Australia. In the US, there have been many instances of personal fines and penalties for environmental damage. In my book, "The Maintenance Scorecard," I touch on the importance of safety in the corporate world and the role of asset management. Incidents like Bncefield, Hatfield, Potters Bar, and others highlight the changing landscape of accountability worldwide. Nowadays, when things go wrong, individuals are being held responsible, not just companies. Are you confident that your decisions and actions would hold up under scrutiny? The environment is evolving rapidly in this regard...</p>

            <p>Texas Report on BP Management Criticizes Safety Failures
By Michael Harrison, Business Editor
Published: 15 January 2007
The Independent

A scathing report on BP management is set to be released by former US secretary of state James Baker, investigating the tragic fire at the Texas City refinery that resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries. The report, commissioned by BP itself following the incident, highlights significant safety lapses in the company's US refinery operations and provides a comprehensive list of recommendations for improvement.

Although the 250-page report does not explicitly name individual directors for criticism, there is speculation that it may lead to changes at the board level. John Manzoni, the board director overseeing the Texas facility, may face scrutiny as the report's findings are unveiled.

The release of the report coincides with the news of BP's chief executive, Lord Browne, stepping down earlier than planned. The Texas City fire in 2005 was a major factor in the decision, as it exposed longstanding safety issues within BP's refining operations.

Despite settling civil actions related to the incident, BP and its managers still face potential criminal charges. The Baker report, initiated in 2005, aims to help BP learn from the tragedy and enhance safety measures to prevent future disasters at its US refineries. Prior to the 2005 fire, the Texas plant had a history of accidents, raising concerns about the company's safety standards.

In response to the findings, BP has implemented changes in its US operations, particularly in safety management. Collaboration with American unions has also been strengthened to ensure ongoing safety oversight at refinery plants.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I wanted to share a valuable link for those who are interested in downloading and reading detailed reports on incidents related to reliability. This link leads to the Baker Report on the Houston Explosion, which contains an illuminating excerpt. James Reason's statement on human error is particularly thought-provoking: "Preventing process accidents requires constant vigilance. A lack of incidents over time does not necessarily indicate that everything is fine and can lead to a dangerous sense of complacency." When individuals lose sight of the intended functionality of safety systems, complacency can set in, leading to forgotten lessons and acceptance of hazards. It is essential to prioritize sound engineering principles and controls to prevent disasters. Neglecting maintenance of systems and controls can result in catastrophic outcomes, such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, and loss of life. Let's stay mindful of the importance of upholding safety standards to prevent tragic consequences for both individuals and communities.</p>
