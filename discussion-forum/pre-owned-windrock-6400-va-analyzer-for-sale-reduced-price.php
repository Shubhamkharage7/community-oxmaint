                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Updated by Kristan Sears 14 days ago - Price reduced! We have a pre-owned Windrock vibration analyzer from 2018 available for sale. We have upgraded to more advanced vibration analysis equipment and tools, and are now looking to find a new owner for this unit. We can provide pictures upon request. We are seeking a reasonable selling price for this unit. While I am not a seasoned user of Windrock analyzers and personally do not prefer them, this unit is of high quality and suitable for specific route-based applications. The unit has recently been calibrated, and the support agreement is active until November. Upon reviewing our documentation, we found that we paid just over $30k for the unit and all its additions in 2018. As of now, we have depreciated $10k in total for the unit and support. 

Update: Due to lack of interest, I am lowering the price of this Windrock 6400 VA to $12,000. I am open to negotiation and reasonable offers. The unit is also listed on eBay. Please refer to the photos provided and contact me directly if you are interested. The upper lid of the storage pockets contains the charger and charger power cord, along with four batteries (one in the unit and three spares), all fully charged. Battery health indicators show 72% battery, and the unit is operational. The device contains numerous data files, with project names truncated for clarity. Features include up to 4 single channels, earphone jack, speed signal, and WiFi antenna (rarely used). Both weakest batteries are on the charger and charging normally.</p>

            <p>Hello KS, I suggest obtaining a quote for a used Windrock 6400 VA without factoring in annual depreciation. I have experience with PA versions, so I am unsure of the value of a VA. If you happen to know anyone selling a 6400 PA or 6320PA, please inform me. I can inquire with Windrock about a resale price if you'd like. Good luck KS!

Sincerely,
Juan Urquiola

Subject: Used Windrock 6400 VA for sale - Price?
I have a used Windrock vibration analyzer from 2018 that we are looking to sell. We have upgraded to more advanced vibration analysis equipment and would like to find a new owner for this unit. I can provide pictures, but I am curious about a fair selling price for this unit. I am not very experienced with Windrock analyzers and personally prefer other brands. However, this unit is of high quality and suitable for specific route-based applications. The calibration is up-to-date, and the support agreement is active until November.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Juan, for your suggestion. We previously approached Windrock about repurchasing the unit, but they declined. I will keep an eye out for a 6320PA unit if available. I believe similar results can be achieved without it at a lower cost. Feel free to reach out to me privately for further discussion. -Kristan

Juan, I appreciate your input regarding the resale of a Windrock 6400 VA unit. I have only worked with PA versions, so I am unsure of the value of a VA model. If anyone is selling a 6400 PA or 6320PA unit, please inform me. I can also inquire with Windrock about their resale prices if needed. Best of luck! - Juan Urquiola

Kristan, I have a used Windrock vibration analyzer from 2018 that we are looking to sell. We have upgraded to more advanced equipment and tools for vibration analysis and would like to find a new owner for this unit. All calibrations are up to date, and the support agreement is active until November. I can provide photos upon request. What would be a fair selling price for this unit? Although I am not a longtime user of Windrock analyzers and personally prefer other brands, this unit is of high quality and suitable for route-based applications.</p>
