                    <p>Hello everyone. I have a 525 VFD that is functioning properly as it displays the output voltage and frequency on the screen. However, I am not getting any voltage readings in UVW when using an oscilloscope or multimeter. I have tried V/Hz control, HIM control, and adjusting the parameters, but the issue persists. These tests are being conducted without the motor being connected. The input voltage is 480 vac and the PF is 525 15 HP. I am seeking advice from anyone who has experienced a similar issue and their recommended solutions. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When no load is connected, the VFD may not produce any output. Most modern VFDs utilize Power FETs for the output stage. FETs act as switchable high-ohm resistors, with resistance ranging from a few ohms when activated to hundreds of megohms when deactivated. If there is no path for the current to flow, the VFD will not produce any output. To resolve this issue, try connecting a load such as a series of incandescent light bulbs and test again. Additionally, ensure that the safety input is correctly connected and has power supply.</p>

            <p>This motor has been in operation for over two years without any issues. The 525 VFD unit is receiving the correct input voltage, ramps up to the desired frequency, but is not producing any voltage output to the motor. This unit has been on site for a significant amount of time and has been working effectively, so it is possible that it is simply a faulty unit. Sert, did you replace the optos or the entire VFD unit?</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, user Steve1972uk shared a troubleshooting issue with a motor that has been in operation for over two years. Despite the motor and wiring checking out fine, a 525 VFD unit is not providing any voltage output to the motor. As the unit has been in use on-site for a while without issues, the assumption is that the unit may be faulty. It is suggested to check for DC voltage on the output, as a common 525 VFD failure is the lack of DC bus voltage to the motor. If unable to detect the issue with a regular meter, a diode test can be performed if the meter provides that function. Detailed instructions can be found through a quick online search.</p>

            <p>If your programming is correct, which is essential when all other drives are functioning properly, then the issue likely lies with the drive power module. These smaller drives do not have repairable parts, as they utilize an “IPM” (Intelligent Power Module) that contains all essential components in a single unit. It no longer matters what caused the failure - it simply happened. Fortunately, the PowerFlex 525 allows for the replacement of only the lower power section, preserving the control section, control wiring, and programming. This ensures a cost-effective solution without the need to redo the entire system.</p>

            <p>patrickmoneyy recommends checking the DC voltage on the output as a common issue with a 525 failure is the DC bus voltage to the motor. If you don't have an automatic AC/DC meter, you may miss this issue. Alternatively, you can perform a diode test with the drive powered off (if your meter has this function). Detailed instructions can be easily found through a quick Google search. Thank you for the advice Patrick, I will conduct the diode test on Tuesday when I am back on site and keep you updated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>According to jraef, if the programming is correct, like it should be with the other functioning drives, then the issue lies with the drive power module being faulty. These small drives contain an "IPM" (Intelligent Power Module) which houses all the necessary components like diodes, transistors, and firing circuits in a single unit, making it non-repairable. It doesn't matter what specifically failed, the fact remains that it did. The good news is that the PowerFlex 525 can be separated so that only the lower power section can be replaced, keeping the control section, control wiring, and programming intact.

Hi Jraef, thank you for your insight. It is likely that the programming is indeed correct since the unit is in a locked control panel with restricted access. I have a question - shouldn't the unit have displayed an error message or code and entered a fault state instead of simply failing to provide output voltage while appearing to continue running and giving the impression that the motor was still operational?</p>

            <p>When operating in V/Hz mode, the motor drive operates independently of whether the motor is connected or not. This means that if there is no output, there will be no current running through the motor, and the drive will not be aware of the reason why. On the other hand, in SVC or FVC mode, the drive relies on motor current feedback to determine the position of the rotor. As a result, it will eventually detect if there is no feedback signal being received.</p>
