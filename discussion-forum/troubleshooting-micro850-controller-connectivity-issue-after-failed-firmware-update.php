                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, everyone! I am currently facing an issue with my Micro850 controller (model number 2080-LC50-48QWB). After creating a simple program for testing purposes, I attempted to download it to the controller using Ethernet and USB connections. However, I encountered an error message indicating a firmware version mismatch (program - v9, PLC - v4).

To resolve this issue, I referred to a datasheet that explained the process of upgrading the device firmware using ControlFLASH. I followed the instructions, selected the correct controller, chose version 9, and initiated the update process. Unfortunately, I encountered an ERROR message towards the end, and the update was not successful. As a result, the controller is now in fault state (indicated by a flashing FAULT red light) and is not detectable through RSLinx, Ethernet, or USB connections.

I am seeking guidance on how to establish a connection with the controller. I have attempted switching between prog mode and run mode, but the fault persists. Any suggestions on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated as the PLC is needed urgently for work purposes. Thank you in advance for your assistance.</p>

            <p>If you have experienced a failure, have you tried power cycling your device? You can find a list of error codes on page 255 of the user manual: http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/2080-um002_-en-e.pdf. Were you using a VM while flashing the device, and were you using a USB or Ethernet connection?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your valuable advice! I have attempted cycling power multiple times without success. Although I did flash with a VM, I previously did this with ControlLogix without any issues. Despite following the manual closely (excluding the VM aspect), I was unable to make any progress. I also considered connecting via a serial port, but that attempt was unsuccessful. This PLC supports Modbus RTU, CIP serial client/server, and CIP symbolic client/server protocols. In RSLinx, I am unsure which driver to configure. I initially tried "RS232 DF1 devices" - should I test another option?</p>

            <p>TijanaJ mentioned that this programmable logic controller (PLC) supports Modbus RTU, CIP serial client/server, and CIP symbolic client/server protocols. They are unsure about which driver to configure in RSLinx and have already tried "RS232 DF1 devices." It is recommended to try using Ethernet IP or the virtual driver, especially if working with 820's more often. By using Ethernet IP, the device may be easily recognized on the network, especially if it has been reset to factory settings. Simply download the program again after establishing the connection.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, tonvip21, it seems there is no solution available for your issue. I came across a response on a different forum that suggested the connection method used during the firmware update could be the culprit. If the update is done via USB and the connection gets interrupted, it can result in the processor becoming "bricked" and unusable. Although I haven't personally worked with the new Micro850 controller, I have encountered similar issues with A-B processors. In such cases, the only solution was to replace the processor. Since I was connected via USB, it is likely that the processor has been "bricked" and is now unusable.</p>

The issue typically results in the device being stuck in a boot-up cycle and unable to read the SD card. If anyone has a bricked Micro800 available for sale, I am interested in purchasing it. Ironically, I also experienced this problem with my new Micro830. How much are you offering for the bricked device?</p>

            <p>If a flashing "RED" fault light appears, it indicates a recoverable fault. To troubleshoot this issue, the first step is to connect via ethernet directly to the PLC. Next, use "WireShark" to identify the PLC's IP address and adjust your computer's network settings accordingly. Once connected, attempt to reprogram the PLC with a new IP address and a simple program. In my experience with numerous Micro 820-830-850-870 PLCs, I have successfully resolved every fault encountered. It's important to remember that there's always a first time for every challenge.</p>

If you are facing the same issue of RSLINX Classic not recognizing your device and unable to upload the EDS file, here's a solution that worked for me. After multiple failed attempts to connect, I decided to try one last method. By connecting via USB to the PLC and accessing Connected Components Workbench (CCW), I opened an existing project for the 850 model. Right-clicked on the Micro850 device and chose the option to update the firmware. Surprisingly, the update process went smoothly without any issues. This troubleshooting step could potentially assist others facing a similar technical issue.</p>

            <p>One user, palmerplc, shared a helpful tip for resolving an issue with an Allen Bradley Micro850 PLC where the 850 and flashing fault light were causing problems. Despite facing challenges with RSLINX Classic not recognizing the device and the inability to upload an EDS file, a solution was finally found. By connecting via USB to the PLC and accessing Connected Components Workbench (CCW), a firmware update was successfully completed by right-clicking on Micro850 and selecting the option to update firmware. This simple solution could potentially assist others facing similar issues. However, it is important to note that this method may not work for every case, as one user faced the same error when attempting to flash from a CCW project. The same menu (RSLinx) appeared during the flashing process, and the same error occurred when selecting the target.</p>

            <p>Plctech1235 mentioned that the 2080-SDMEMRTC-SC module can perform firmware updates from the SD card without needing a PC. This feature prompted them to purchase a couple of modules. However, Firejo pointed out that a potential issue could arise if the processor does not detect the memory module unless it is configured properly. This could make the process futile if configuration is required using a PC anyways. The experience shared highlights the importance of properly setting up the module to ensure seamless operation. For example, when dealing with 820 modules, inserting the card and powering it up results in the system transitioning into the RUN mode with the lights illuminating after a short period. This demonstrates the significance of correctly configuring the modules for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>The compatibility with RS Linx Classic or Factory Talk Linx has been lost. An error in the catalog number is causing issues with Control Flash, displaying as 2080-LC50-24QBB. Control Flash Plus is also not functioning properly, showing a communication error when trying to connect to the target device. Attempts to update have failed and the module needs to be reset. Additionally, there is a connection problem with Connected Components Workbench (CCW) for firmware updates, as the module cannot be selected from the Factory Talk list due to a catalog number issue. To potentially resolve these issues, there is a plan to try using an SD card with the 2080-SDMEMRTC-SC module for firmware installation without relying on Control Flash or CCW. It is also being considered whether using a serial port connection could help with firmware reinstallation. The model number of the necessary cable for this connection is unknown.

            <p>It's been quite some time since this discussion thread was last active. However, if you're facing issues with what you think is a bricked microcontroller, I'd like to share my experience with a firmware upgrade attempt on a 2080-LC50 24QWB model, going from version 2 to version 10.

During the upgrade process, the system failed while polling for power up. I couldn't establish a connection, but when I checked in RSlinx, I could see it through the USB under AB-VBP1 (virtual backplane). However, it only displayed the base catalogue number (Micro 850 2080-LC50) without the specific I/O catalogue number (24QWB in my case).

To resolve this issue, I navigated to Controlflash, accessed the virtual backplane, drilled down to Micro 850-LC50, and selected PCviaUSB Unknown Bus to reestablish the connection. It's important to note that the microcontroller defaults to a different catalogue number than the one you have, resulting in an "invalid catalogue number" error message. Therefore, you need to start from the first LC50 catalogue number in Controlflash, drill down to PCviaUSB every time, and then click "next" to proceed with the firmware upgrade.

You may continue to encounter the "invalid catalogue number" error until you reach the new catalogue number assigned by the microcontroller. In my case, it reassigned as 2080-LC50-24QBB. Don't forget to drill down to PCviaUSB in Controlflash during this process.

I hope this information proves helpful to anyone experiencing similar challenges.</p>

            <p>A user named geniusintraining expressed doubt about the effectiveness of a potential solution for bricked PLCs due to firmware flashing issues. When a PLC gets "bricked," it often gets stuck in a boot-up cycle and fails to read the SD card. If anyone has a bricked Micro800 they're willing to sell, please contact me. I currently have 8 bricked Micro850 units available for purchase.</p>
