            <p>Welcome to the forum! Are you using a 32-bit Windows system? If you have a 64-bit system, I recommend installing the 64-bit version for better performance. It appears that your current version is outdated - have you considered upgrading to a newer version for improved features and security?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum! Are you running a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows system? If you're using a 64-bit system, it's recommended to install the 64-bit version for better performance. It appears that your software version is outdated - consider upgrading to a newer version for optimal functionality. I appreciate your response - I am currently using a 64-bit system and have already updated to the latest 64-bit version of Codesys. However, the issue persists. This problem suddenly occurred, possibly after a Windows update. The programming is being done in the InoProShop program, which is based on Codesis, and this issue has not arisen before.</p>

            <p>It seems like you may be experiencing issues with your anti-virus software causing problems with the CoDeSys gateway. One possible solution could be to add the CoDeSys gateway to the exception list of your anti-virus program. Alternatively, you can try adding GatewaySysTray.exe to the Windows firewall rules. A CoDeSys expert once mentioned that this may not be ideal, but it could be worth trying. Hopefully, someone with more knowledge can provide additional assistance.</p>

            <p>AlfredoQuintero mentioned that he has never encountered this issue before. It's possible that your anti-virus software is causing the problem. Have you tried adding the CoDeSys gateway to the exception list of the anti-virus program? Although one CoDeSys expert advised against it, it may be worth a try. Another suggestion is to add the GatewaySysTray.exe to the rules of the Windows firewall. The file path is "C:\Program Files\CODESYS 3.5.19.50\GatewayPLC\GatewaySysTray.exe." Hopefully, someone with more expertise will see this post and offer further assistance. Despite attempting to add an exception in Windows without success, I appreciate your efforts to help. I will continue working in a virtual machine for the time being.</p>
