                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Running a Conveyor System with Balluff Remote Ethernet blocks, the topography includes ethernet connections from Master-2 to Master-1 (BNI EIP-502-105-Z015). Master-1 controls 4 slave blocks (BNI IOL-302-000-Z012), with Slave Block #4 experiencing connectivity issues on the top half of each M-12 I/O connector. After replacing the slave block, only one input light is working and the outputs are non-functional. I will switch back to the original configuration to check if the issue persists. I am able to ping the master and access its web page. Does the RS5000 (Compact Logix 5380) provide all necessary settings besides the IP address or is there something else that needs to be configured? I have made adjustments to the program to operate the loads in this zone and proceed to the next, but the issue persists, despite replacing blocks and cables.</p>

            <p>After swapping out a faulty New Slave #4 with the original one, I discovered that half of the Slave module was unresponsive due to certain ports not functioning. While some motor starters were receiving output signals from the program, others were not connected properly at the I/O slave.</p>

            <p>Hello, Roxusa! I want to clarify your topology, although I am doing this from memory. You will connect your Ethernet switch to a Balluff master switch, which can support up to 8 slave blocks. It is crucial to configure the IP information in the master block and set it up in the IO configuration section of the PLC program. In the PLC program, you need to define the ports for the master block for I/O and analog functions. Each master block will have ports 0 to 7, requiring 8 configuration parts. If you add a slave module to port 2, you must include the configuration part of that slave under the main port 2, resulting in ports 1 to 8 for the slave blocks. When documenting the program, ensure to detail each master port and then document the slave ports when adding them. Each slave port will consist of two parts. For example, if you add an 8-port slave to port 2, you will have 16 inputs. The addressing format will be like 2.0.0 for pin 2 and 2.0.1 for pin 4 on port 1 of the slave. Remember to document everything comprehensively. Each Balluff AOI is tailored for a specific block, and it is crucial to use the correct series of AOI for your DC input card to avoid compatibility issues that can arise between series 1 and series 3 cards of the same number. If in doubt, always seek clarification to ensure smooth operation. I hope this information proves helpful to you. - James</p>

            <p>I noticed the AOI section in the program and assumed that my issue was related to a faulty slave module. I am unsure about the process of setting the IP address and other configurations when changing the master module and how AOIs play a role in it. The conveyor was functioning, but I am disappointed that a new slave did not work while the old one had missing outputs. I have access to the program but lack expertise in AOIs. This particular master has 4 slaves, with the other 3 working properly. I am in the process of obtaining the OEM for them and managed to fix 5 out of 7 lines by adjusting a few addresses. I will revisit the manual before troubleshooting this specific issue again.</p>
