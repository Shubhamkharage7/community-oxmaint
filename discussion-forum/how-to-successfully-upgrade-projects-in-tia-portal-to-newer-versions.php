            <p>Archiving a project gives you the option to permanently delete recoverable information, which can often resolve mysterious errors. I've experienced instances where archiving and restoring a project in TIA software has successfully resolved issues. This simple process may have been the key to solving the problem in this particular case.</p>

            <p>JRW mentioned not having seen that particular error yet. If you encountered an error during the upgrade process, it may have resulted in a failed upgrade. In such cases, referring to the log file for more information is recommended. If the project still cannot be upgraded, it is advisable to seek assistance from Siemens Customer Support. The error message "Reorganization failed in IntegrateFilePhase! RootCause: ReintegrationResult: Failed! Reason: It could not exchange the files, ErrorDetail: StorageController.Exchange: IOException occured: System.IO.IOException: Det går inte att skapa en fil som redan finns" indicates a file creation issue.

Upon reaching out to Siemens and providing them with the project, they were able to open it in version 18. This was possible because they received the archived file. After some troubleshooting steps, including reinstalls and firewall adjustments, a solution was eventually found. JesperMP suggested archiving the project with the option to discard recoverable information, which has proven effective in resolving errors in the past. This method of archiving and retrieving the project may have played a role in resolving the issue at hand.</p>
