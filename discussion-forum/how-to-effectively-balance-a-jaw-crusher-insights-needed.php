                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, friends! I need your expertise on a pressing issue I'm dealing with. Recently, I conducted vibration measurements on a jaw crusher and discovered that the vibrations are likely due to imbalance. If you have experience working with such machinery, I would greatly appreciate any insights on how to effectively balance this equipment. Is dynamic balancing a viable option, or are there specialized techniques needed for this type of machinery? Is it normal for this equipment to operate with some level of imbalance? I am unsure if balancing is necessary or if a certain degree of imbalance is to be expected. Any thoughts or advice you can offer would be immensely valuable. Just a heads up, the crusher underwent repairs where bearings were replaced and the foundation was reconstructed.

            <p>Christian, the vibrations observed in the jaw crusher during your measurements are likely due to imbalance, which is common in reciprocating machines like this one. The rotating crank shaft may have compensating weights to reduce vibration in one plane, but they can create an unbalanced force in another plane. Typically, these machines are designed with compensating weights to achieve a moderate level of vibration. If there are compensating weights on the crank, attempting to balance the shaft is not recommended. To address high vibration levels, a sturdy foundation or an isolation base is required. If you have experience with such equipment, your insights on balancing techniques for the jaw crusher would be valuable. It is important to ensure that the machine is properly balanced to prevent damage to the foundation and bearings. Your expertise and suggestions are appreciated. - Eugene Vogel</p>

            <p>Hello, Christian! This forum is an invaluable resource for all our endeavors, wouldn't you agree? Let's delve into the workings of a jaw crusher. The jaw crusher operates on a unique mechanism where the jaw is connected to the main shaft through an eccentric, while the upper part remains relatively stable. This configuration allows for the crushing of rocks into smaller pieces through a "chewing" motion. The gap between the jaw and the back plate can be adjusted to ensure the output rock size is suitable for further crushing in secondary crushers such as cone or hammer crushers. It's normal for the jaw crusher to exhibit large 1xTS and 2xTS vibrations. To ensure smooth operation, the jaw shaft drive pulley must undergo dynamic balancing, typically done in a specialized repair facility with the necessary equipment. The frequency of vibration during operation can provide insights into the machine's structural integrity. If you suspect imbalance issues, it's crucial to address them promptly. Feel free to contact me for more guidance and assistance. Jim Carrel, CRL-BB, ISO Cat. III COO, Reliability Coach. For reliable insights, visit www.forumreliability.com.</p>

            <p>Dear Christian and Jim, the discussion around what constitutes a reciprocating machine is intriguing. The key point is that the moving jaw's mass has both a linear and circular component to its motion. The linear component generates a 1xRPM force in a specific plane. Check out this informative animation at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3np_Ipw3R-A. Take note of the compensating weight on the pulley, which should not be balanced independently of the crank (eccentric) shaft. Gene ------------------------------ Eugene Vogel ------------------------------ 

Dear Jim Carrel, 

It's fantastic to see this forum aiding our efforts. While the jaw crusher is not a reciprocating machine, the jaw's linkage to the main shaft via an eccentric allows for a 'chewing' action as the space between the jaw and back plate adjusts with each shaft rotation, crushing rocks into smaller pieces. This adjustable space ensures the output rock dimensions suit other crushers. Vibration is normal, and balancing the pulley is crucial for smooth operation. If you need help understanding vibration patterns or balancing techniques, feel free to reach out. Jim Carrel, CRL-BB, ISO Cat. III COO, Reliability Coach 206-892-8074 Reliability into Every Company www.forumreliability.com

Christian, in a reciprocating machine like the jaw crusher, the 1xRPM vibration is often attributed to the reciprocating motion. Compensating weights on the crankshaft can help reduce this vibration but may introduce an unbalanced 1xRPM force in the perpendicular plane. Balancing the crankshaft in these scenarios is not recommended. Consider reinforcing the foundation or using an isolation base to address excessive vibration. Gene ------------------------------ Eugene Vogel ------------------------------ 

If you're experiencing imbalance-related vibrations in your jaw crusher, exploring dynamic balancing techniques may offer a solution. Understanding the possibility of imbalance in this type of equipment is crucial for maintenance and operational efficiency. Seeking professional advice on balancing methods and the significance of imbalance in equipment operation can provide valuable insights for effective maintenance strategies. Additionally, investigating the root causes of imbalance, such as mechanical looseness, can help in addressing issues before they escalate. Your input and experiences are highly appreciated. ------------------------------ Christian Petroniu ------------------------------</p>

            <p>Thank you, Gene, for the informative video. This is not just about balancing, but about minimizing the natural effects of the main shaft force caused by the eccentricity. The compensating weights are specifically designed to reduce directional vibrations caused by the eccentric motion. It may not be necessary to alter the size of the weights, but their positioning and potential mishandling during reassembly could be the issue. Considering the mounting aspect, I suggest using motion amplification or an operating deflection shape analysis to pinpoint the source of excessive movement or incorrect force angles. If the issue stems from improper repair or reassembly, it should be addressed as a warranty concern by the contractors. Feel free to contact me with any queries. Jim Carrel, CRL-BB, ISO Cat.

            <p>On-site balancing of a rotor can be achieved, provided the issue of looseness is addressed first. Spectras revealed a significant looseness problem that cannot be fully rectified through balancing. While balancing may partially reduce the issue, it tends to reappear with increased intensity over time.
It is essential to troubleshoot and address the underlying cause of looseness before attempting to balance the rotor. Jan Krivohlavy, a renowned Vibration Consultant, emphasizes the importance of thorough troubleshooting to ensure long-term balance and functionality of the equipment.
In a recent discussion about jaw crusher balancing, it was noted that the imbalance of the moving jaw and crank shaft may be causing vibrations. Eugene Vogel highlighted the reciprocating nature of the machine and the need for proper balancing techniques to address such issues effectively.

            <p>As per my request, the frame fastening on the foundation needs to be redone. Following this, we will conduct a series of vibration and phase measurements to determine the feasibility of balancing. It was also mentioned in the discussion that balancing such a rotor can be challenging if there is any looseness issue, as indicated by spectral analysis results. While balancing can help partially address the problem, it may not fully resolve the issue, leading to recurring problems with increased intensity.

In the case of a jaw crusher, balancing the equipment on-site can be crucial, especially if there are imbalances in the moving jaw and crank shaft. It is important to troubleshoot any looseness problems before attempting to balance the equipment. Additionally, understanding the nature of reciprocating motion in such machines is essential for effective balancing techniques.

            <p>Hello Jim, I will attempt to address your inquiries based on information provided by the beneficiary. AQ1: The contractor justified the adjustment of the balancing weights position by stating that, based on their experience, the operation is more efficient in that placement. Please note that the pulley is fixed on the wedge channel and its mounting position cannot be altered. There was no possibility of an incorrect mounting position. Each pulley is equipped with balance weights, estimated to be around 200 kg per pulley. The crusher experienced high vibrations from the initial start-up, resulting in cracks in the casing, bearing destruction, and foundation damage. Given these repercussions, it is believed that the balancing weights may not have been correctly installed during the initial setup. AQ2: If you have reviewed the attached document, you will notice that the vibration primarily occurs at 1TS in the horizontal direction. Phase measurements were not taken. The high values are concentrated on the bearing, with values on the casing and frame being absorbed by the foundation. The purpose of the weights on the pulley is not to balance the pulley itself but rather to balance the machine. A compromise needs to be reached to minimize further damage to the machine under current conditions. This is why your advice is being sought, as someone may have encountered similar situations.

            <p>According to information received, the repair process included replacing all the crusher bearings, removing the old undersized foundation and replacing it with a new one of the same size, replacing the cracked crusher body, and securing the crusher frame to the foundation with bolts fixed using chemical anchors for concrete. However, vibrations were present from the beginning, causing the bolts to be pulled out of the concrete. This suggests a problem with the alignment of the foundation or the feet. To address this issue, shims were suggested to be placed under the feet to compensate for any unevenness in the foundation. The recurring bolt pullouts are a result of the problem, not the cause, indicating a need for a reevaluation of the setup. Balancing the equipment may be necessary to reduce the high vibration amplitudes. Consideration of epoxy grout for a stronger foundation and ensuring proper alignment of the frame are key factors to prevent future issues. A picture of the unit would be helpful for further analysis. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Anchoring plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and effectiveness of a Jaw crusher. Simply using glued iron threads in drilled holes may not provide the necessary anchoring for optimal performance. Instead, a long anchor embedded through a large concrete piece, secured with specialized chemical glue is recommended. It is important to avoid oiled concrete, use a "net" tube inside the bore to hold the glue, and have the anchoring job done by a skilled professional. The ideal anchor is one that is securely welded or encircled to a strong perpendicular beam within a large concrete base. Calculating the weight and dimensions of the foundation is essential to prevent resonance issues. Additionally, it is crucial to avoid connecting multiple concrete parts as it can lead to problems. To prevent cracks and loosening, ensure the concrete is not freshly poured during machine startup. Once the foundation and anchoring are secure, troubleshooting vibrations can commence. Optimal balancing techniques are necessary to address any vibration issues effectively. Regards, Jan Krivohlavy, Vibration Consultant.</p>

            <p>Hello, Jan,
The overcurrent protection is currently disabled because if it is not disabled, the motor will not be able to start the crusher. The jaw is currently in the lower position, and with the protection on, the motor is unable to lift it up. This is a clear indication that the crusher is experiencing severe imbalance.

It is crucial to ensure that the overcurrent and undervoltage protection devices are properly configured to prevent motor burnout. If these devices are not functioning correctly, it can lead to serious issues. This is a task best handled by a skilled electrician rather than vibration specialists. When these protective measures are triggered, there is likely a valid reason behind it, which could be related to mechanical issues causing vibrations within the machine.

Troubleshooting such problems solely through written communication is challenging. It's important to address any underlying issues that may have been present from the start to avoid further complications.

The anchoring of the jaw crusher is another critical aspect to consider. Proper anchoring is essential for the stability of the crusher. Using high-quality anchors, such as those secured deeply within a large concrete base with specialized chemical glue, can help ensure the machine's stability. It is essential to avoid any issues with anchoring as it can lead to vibration troubles.

Foundation dimensioning is a complex task that requires engineering calculations to ensure the stability of the machine. Resonance issues should be carefully addressed, and precautions should be taken to prevent any potential problems. It is crucial to allow the concrete foundation to properly set before starting the machine to avoid any structural issues.

Once the foundation and anchoring are properly secured, it is essential to conduct thorough vibration troubleshooting to address any imbalance issues effectively.

            <p>Hello Christian, I successfully completed urgent emergency frame-to-concrete re-anchoring using "mortar chemical anchor" and threaded rod. To troubleshoot effectively, proper anchor installation and over-dimensioning are crucial. Seeing images or videos can aid in providing valuable advice, as they provide context that texts cannot fully convey. However, sometimes on-site investigation or testing may be necessary to address issues not captured in visuals. If the base concrete was initially problematic, removing vibrations on site may require advanced work. While it might be possible to dampen vibrations partially, a thorough solution could be challenging and time-consuming. Solid basement and frame anchoring are essential for a successful start, especially for customers dealing with high vibration issues. Finding temporary, quick fixes for weak foundations may not always be feasible. Success often hinges on attention to countless small details that are hard to predict. Enjoy the process!

Original Message: Sent: 9/21/2023 1:29:00 AM From: christian petroniu Subject: RE: Jaw crusher balancing As per the information I received during the repair process, the following actions were taken: - Replacement of all crusher bearings - Removal of the old foundation and installation of a new one of the same size (though, in my opinion, undersized) - Replacement of the crusher body due to cracks in the old one - After pouring the foundation, the crusher frame was placed on it and secured with 3 bolts on each foot, fixed with chemical anchors for concrete. Initially, vibrations were noticed in the crusher and soon after, the bolts were pulled out of the concrete. Despite adding more bolts to the feet with multiple holes in the concrete, the issue persisted. Upon inspection, it appears that either the foundation was not poured evenly or the feet are uneven. I suggested using shims under the elevated feet to align them with the foundation and prevent bolt breakage. The current problem of bolt breakage in the concrete is a result of an underlying issue, not its cause. Even after re-fixing the frame, the vibration levels are expected to remain high. Therefore, the question arises—should the equipment be balanced or not?

            <p>To effectively balance this machine for optimal performance, follow these steps: Start by setting up for 2-plane balancing in the horizontal plane and documenting the original amplitude and phase vectors on both sides of the machine horizontally. Then, move the transducers to the vertical plane and record the corresponding amplitude and phase vectors. Next, manually plot these vectors on polar graph paper - one side on each graph labeled as "Oh" and "Ov." 

Add a trial weight to the rotor on one side of the machine and record new horizontal and vertical vectors for both sides. Label these vectors as "O+Th" and "O+Tv" and plot them accordingly. Construct the Th and Tv vectors for the side with the trial weight by drawing a vector from Oh to O+Th and from Ov to O+Tv. This will give you a single plane vector solution for both horizontal and vertical components.

If the vector diagrams seem confusing, automatic balancing programs won't suffice. Evaluate if the horizontal and vertical vector diagrams produce similar solutions - if not, the vibration might not be due to rotor imbalance. In case the solutions are similar, proceed with single plane balancing on that side of the machine. If successful, expand to 2-plane balancing using data from both sides. 

This process will help determine the cause of vibration issues and provide a strategic approach to achieve balance for optimal machine performance. This method is essential for addressing any imbalance in the machine's operation.</p>

            <p>Hello Jan, thank you for your valuable advice. In your experience, is the order and placement of measurement points crucial for balancing a jaw crusher? I have avoided using readings in both directions within the same balancing program. My plan is to utilize channel 1 for the drive end (DE) bearing and channel 2 for the non-drive end (NDE) bearing for horizontal readings, while using channel 3 for the DE bearing and channel 4 for the NDE bearing for vertical readings. Do you think this setup is appropriate, or do you suggest an alternate arrangement of the transducers?

When balancing a reciprocating machine like a jaw crusher, I have successfully used an Emerson CSI device with 4 channels for measurement (2x vertical + 2x horizontal). The vector averaging algorithm, possibly developed in collaboration with Schenck, has proven effective for balancing reciprocating machines. I recommend trying the CSI 2130, CSI 2140, Emerson AMS 2140, or any other device with advanced field balancing software for troubleshooting and progress in balancing.

It is essential, as I mentioned before, to address any issues with the frame tightening on the foundation before conducting vibration and phase measurements to determine if imbalance is the root cause and if it can be rectified. Initial observations suggest that imbalance is the likely culprit, hence my request for assistance on balancing techniques for this type of equipment.

Regarding vibrodiagnostic measurements and concerns about a potentially bent shaft, it is crucial to verify the shaft's condition before proceeding with any balancing efforts. Phase measurements will help determine if the shaft is indeed bent, although this assumption cannot be made without proper verification.

In a previous communication, I provided details of the repair work carried out on the jaw crusher, including bearing replacements and foundation reconstruction to address prior issues. The vibrations observed post-repair indicate a possible imbalance issue, leading to mechanical looseness in the frame-to-foundation connection. Addressing the root cause of these vibrations is essential before deciding whether balancing the equipment is necessary. Your insights and recommendations on this matter are greatly appreciated.

If possible, could you share your thoughts on whether regular cement grout or epoxy grout was used during the base securing process? Epoxy grout is known for its superior strength and durability, which could be beneficial in this scenario. Additionally, ensuring that the frame remains true during the base installation is crucial for the equipment's stability. A visual of the unit would also be helpful for further assessment.

Thank you for your collaboration and assistance in addressing the balancing challenges faced with the jaw crusher. Your expertise in vibration analysis and balancing techniques is invaluable in resolving these issues effectively.</p>

            <p>When it comes to balance training, the key point to remember is that the exact measurement location is not crucial; what truly matters is the magnitude of the unbalance vector that you aim to reduce at the specific measurement point. For example, let's consider a scenario where a worker is operating on a slightly unbalanced grinder, resulting in decreased output or product quality. Upon receiving a complaint about vibration and shaking glass, the operator decides to place a sensor on the bearing house. However, they notice that the unbalance vector is very slow at that point. To their surprise, when the sensor is moved to the glass, the vector increases significantly due to the glass's resonance sensitivity. By strategically placing the sensor on the glass, the energy can be reduced by over 70%, which is a substantial improvement compared to balancing based on the bearing house sensor. The key takeaway here is not magic but rather understanding and managing energy levels effectively. Therefore, it is advisable to explore and identify the maximal vector magnitude on your machine, which may sometimes require unconventional sensor placement for optimal results. Remember, what works in one case may not work in another, so it's essential to experiment and determine the most effective approach for your specific situation.

Dear Christian,

Thank you for your query regarding the importance of order and positioning of measurement points. In my experience, the specific order and placement of transducers can play a significant role in achieving accurate balancing results. While your proposed setup with channels 1 and 2 for horizontal readings and channels 3 and 4 for vertical readings seems reasonable, I would recommend considering alternative mounting configurations to ensure comprehensive data collection. For instance, utilizing advanced devices like the CSI 2130 or CSI 2140 from Emerson with vector averaging algorithms can offer enhanced precision, especially for reciprocating machines. Therefore, I suggest exploring various transducer placements and experimenting with different measurement setups to optimize the balancing process effectively.

Best Regards,
Christian Petroniu

            <p>The likelihood of the shaft being bent is high due to the potential high torque of ELM. Improper assembly could also result in bending the frame body with bearinghouse. It is crucial to explore all potential causes by digging deeper into the issue at hand, much like peeling back the layers of an onion to uncover the root problem.

Jan Krivohlavy, a Vibration Consultant operating a self-owned business, highlights the importance of examining each aspect of the equipment to address any underlying issues.

In a recent communication, Christian Petroniu noted the installation of new shafts and bearings, emphasizing the need for phase measurements to determine if the shaft is indeed bent. This step is crucial in diagnosing the problem accurately.

When dealing with similar machinery issues, it is essential to consider factors such as the type of grout used for securing the base and the proper alignment of the frame during installation. Taking these steps can prevent issues such as vibrations and mechanical looseness in the future. Anyone with experience in handling such equipment is encouraged to share their insights on balancing techniques and the impact of imbalance on operational efficiency.

Christian Petroniu seeks advice on the possibility of dynamically balancing the jaw crusher to address vibrations caused by imbalance. The recent repairs conducted on the equipment, including bearing replacements and foundation reconstruction, hint at potential recurring issues that may need to be resolved through proper balancing techniques. Your input and expertise are valuable in resolving this equipment-related concern.</p>
