                    <p>Seeking advice on behalf of a non-forum member, I am inquiring about successful implementation of reliability processes in healthcare organizations. While there are instances of IR scanning, trap programs, and oil analysis in certain areas, I am interested in examples of comprehensive programs implemented across a campus or organization. I have had difficulty finding examples and am considering moving forward with creating a reliability plan in my organization. Although there may be differences between manufacturing and healthcare, similar principles should be applicable. Any guidance, examples, or articles you can provide would be greatly appreciated as I prepare to move forward with this initiative. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When discussing "health care organizations," it's important to consider the various approaches they take. For instance, Eli Lilly has developed a robust and efficient PdM process within their manufacturing facilities. On the other hand, my past experience with Baxter HealthCare was disappointing as they failed to heed the advice they were paying for. Unfortunately, many hospitals, despite being primarily funded by the public, often lack the necessary resources and understanding of critical issues. However, St. Jude's in Memphis stands out as a shining example. They handle the majority of their operations internally, only outsourcing specialty services, and consistently deliver exceptional care. Their dedication to patients is truly inspiring. It's worth noting that a renowned organization like St. Jude's places a strong emphasis on facility maintenance, demonstrating their commitment to all aspects of healthcare delivery.</p>

            <p>Hello Don, I have an intriguing question for you: is the absence of regular maintenance causing bigger financial losses for these individuals in the long run? What are the potential repercussions of equipment failures, and have you witnessed any major blunders as a result? I recently had a hospital maintenance engineer approach me for a proposal to implement a maintenance program, but unfortunately, it did not receive funding. I am curious to hear your thoughts on these two questions. Best regards, Steve.</p>

            <p>It has been observed that the majority of healthcare services have merged over time, with multiple separate businesses now operating as one cohesive unit. This integration has led to the adoption of inherited practices and a lack of proper project management, with a focus only on preventive maintenance in accordance with the insurance provider's requirements. The facility faces challenges due to a shortage of trained and skilled staff, leading to a constant firefighting approach. Despite managing to address some root cause analysis (RCA) findings, there is limited availability to conduct maintenance on equipment due to their round-the-clock operation. The facility serves both an energy plant and a hospital, catering to various clients. The importance of ensuring patient comfort and uninterrupted surgical procedures is emphasized, as downtime can result in significant financial losses. Reports suggest that the cost of surgery fan shutdowns can reach up to $100,000 per hour.</p>
