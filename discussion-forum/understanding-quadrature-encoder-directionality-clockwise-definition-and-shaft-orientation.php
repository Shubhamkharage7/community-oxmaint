                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am seeking some input from individuals who utilize encoders. It is commonly accepted that a typical quadrature encoder will have Output A leading Output B in phase when rotating in a clockwise direction. However, determining what is considered "clockwise" can be a bit confusing. This often depends on which end of the shaft you are looking at. I am specifically concerned with a standard solid-shaft encoder, such as the SICK DFS25 series. According to the IEC standard (IEC 60034-8), clockwise is defined as the direction in which an electric motor spins when viewed from the load side, with the output shaft facing the observer. However, despite encoders having a shaft like a motor, they are actually the driven device. This raises the question of whether the standard direction for "clockwise" should be considered from the opposite side of the device. This topic has become relevant as I am attempting to replace an old DRS26 encoder with a modern DFS25A model. The modern encoders offer programmable phase direction, with instructions from the machine builder to set the direction as "A leads B at CCW." In contrast, the old encoders simply "follow the standard," leaving some uncertainty regarding what the standard actually is. Given the complexity of swapping pins with these particular connectors, which are difficult to obtain, I want to ensure that I make the correct choice on my first attempt.</p>

            <p>When determining the orientation of encoders, it is common to assume it is from the shaft end. This is because encoders are frequently mounted on the rear of a motor, making it logical to define their positioning in alignment with the motor.</p>
