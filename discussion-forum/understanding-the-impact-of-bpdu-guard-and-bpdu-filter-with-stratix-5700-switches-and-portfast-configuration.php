                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone,

I have been experimenting with 2 Stratix switches in my testing setup to observe how various configurations impact the behavior when 2 managed switches are linked. By default, the configuration is set to MSTP with the options for BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter enabled.

Question 1: Do these options apply globally to access ports, or are they specifically for ports where PortFast is activated?

Question 2: Considering their different purposes, is there a need to have both options activated? It appears that they serve distinct functions, and if PortFast is activated, having BPDU Guard only would suffice.

I am just scratching the surface of the features related to spanning tree and would love to hear different perspectives.

Update: Initially, I encountered an issue where connecting the two switches resulted in all ports being blocked for approximately 10 seconds. Enabling PortFast on access ports and establishing trunking between the switches seemed to resolve this problem.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While experimenting, I disabled BPDU filtering to observe any changes in behavior. Upon attempting to re-enable it, I received an error message stating that "BPDU Guard and BPDU Filter cannot be activated simultaneously." This sheds light on the situation, but I am curious as to why both features are initially enabled globally.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is recommended to have both BPDU Guarding and Filter enabled for optimal network security. This may be a GUI-related issue, so make sure to keep both options checked for proper operation. BPDU plays a crucial role in safeguarding your network against malicious attacks.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The BPDU Filter feature is a useful tool to prevent BPDU guard from triggering on a per port basis. This option is ideal for scenarios where you need to connect a switch to a specific port but do not want it to interact with Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or risk being shutdown by BPDU Guard. By filtering out BPDU packets, you can ensure smooth connectivity without the risk of disruption. 

It's recommended to check if BPDU Filter is enabled globally by using the CLI and reviewing the configuration settings. Typically, ports with portfast enabled may automatically go into err-disable mode when BPDU Guard is triggered. To avoid this, it's advisable to assign the appropriate macro settings to the ports before connecting any devices.</p>
