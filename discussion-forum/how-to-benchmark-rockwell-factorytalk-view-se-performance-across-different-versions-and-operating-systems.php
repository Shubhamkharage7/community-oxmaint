                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hey there! I'm currently exploring ways to benchmark the performance of Rockwell FactoryTalk View SE software across different versions and operating systems. After setting up this software in various environments for clients in British Columbia, the question that often arises is whether newer versions offer improved speed.

I'm curious if anyone has suggestions on how to create an HMI display that can consistently assess the performance of an HMI across various versions and operating systems. My current concept involves creating an HMI display that loads 30 pop-ups, aborts them, writes text files to the disk using VBA on each page, and retrieves complex derived tag values while a stopwatch runs in a docked menu bar.

Have you ever attempted anything similar to this? I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experiences or any ideas for constructing a tool like this. Your insights would be invaluable. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have recently created a GFX file to monitor CPU and Disk Write Speed due to limited options available. My plan is to expand this file to include Disk Read Speed, various gauges, and performance metrics. This tool can be valuable when diagnosing and troubleshooting performance issues for system integrators. The file was developed in FTView 13 SE and the disk write speed test involves creating a text file on the c:\ drive, so ensure that View has the necessary permissions to write to that location.</p>
