                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings everyone, I am a first-time contributor but a long-time follower of these forums. Despite searching extensively, I have been unable to find a solution to our current issue. Our system is experiencing a communication failure with a crucial electrical component, as indicated by SCADA due to the status bits. I have thoroughly inspected and replaced the radio, as well as verified the other components. The contractor has made changes to the Reference Address (referencing RJ45 CPU ETHERNET data) and the variable tag. However, the old and new variable bits are not showing any changes in Data Watch. Despite checking the logic and variables, I am unable to pinpoint the problem.

No rewiring has been done, the only component replaced was the radio, which has been confirmed to be communicating properly. I am able to remotely access all devices on the system post-installation. Testing MODBUS to Ethernet switches to radio has not revealed any issues. There is ladder logic in place that alters the Read/Write status bits every two minutes, resulting in updated data. However, the status turns FALSE immediately after a 3-second delay.

Is there a way to access diagnostics for the channel transmitted through the Ethernet port on the CPU? Despite monitoring the reference bit via Data Watch, there have been no changes apart from the 2-minute force reset. PLC Diagnostics have been checked with no reported issues. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Michael.</p>

            <p>Are the communications between the SCADA system and the PLC experiencing issues? Have the status bits being monitored shown any discrepancies since the contractor's work on the equipment? Are these status bits influenced by the PLC's logic?</p>
