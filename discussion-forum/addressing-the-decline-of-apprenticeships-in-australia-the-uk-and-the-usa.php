                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, after a recent discussion on another thread, I felt compelled to address a topic that is very close to my heart. Starting my career as an apprentice electrician in a mining company in Northern Australia was a valuable experience that provided me with a solid foundation for my future. Unfortunately, the focus on apprenticeships seems to have declined in countries like Australia, the UK, and the USA in recent years, leading to a shortage of opportunities for young individuals entering the workforce.

This decline in apprenticeships is concerning not only for the individuals missing out on valuable training and experience but also for the economies of our countries. As professionals, and members of professional associations, can we come together to address this issue? Is this a shared concern, or am I alone in feeling passionate about the need for more apprenticeship opportunities for the next generation? Let's work together to ensure that all young individuals have access to the same opportunities that have benefited many of us in our careers.</p>

            <p>Daryl highlighted a prevalent issue in apprenticeships and engineering in the USA, especially in areas like reliability, maintenance, and power. This issue extends to industrial apprenticeships as well, affecting unions, professional societies, and trade associations in North America, including Canada. Howard acknowledges the efforts being made to address this issue.</p>

            <p>It's time to address the issue of endangered companies, Daryl. I've noticed a concerning trend in industries like mining: outsourcing. White-collar workers have taken control, prioritizing numbers over understanding the core business operations. Unfortunately, cutting costs by reducing grunt workers only creates more problems. The assumption that outsourcing will eliminate overhead expenses is often proven wrong, leading to quality control issues and increased costs. Instead of focusing on management training, one individual saw an opportunity to provide training for grunt workers in a field with a history of apprenticeship programs. By prioritizing the skills development of grunt workers, he found success where others failed. Neglecting training for grunt workers leads to costly mistakes and higher accident rates, ultimately impacting the bottom line.</p>

            <p>Svanels: I haven't delved into this much myself, but I am currently dealing with a similar issue with a client. They have a highly skilled workforce, but middle management seems to believe that replacing them with outside contractors will simplify their roles and potentially save on costs. From my experience, this approach can lead to unexpected outcomes that go against what is typically taught in MBA programs. Making outsourcing the primary objective, rather than just a strategy, often results in negative consequences. Howard</p>

            <p>I believe that the term "grunt worker" carries a negative connotation and should be replaced with a more dignified description. I am pleased to see a shift towards recognizing the value of these essential workers. It is important for managers to find a new approach to appreciate and empower this crucial group. As someone who has worked in similar positions, I have always felt that I was more than just a grunt worker. I took pride in my ability to make things happen and recognized the importance of my contributions. While I may have engaged in physically demanding tasks, I never saw myself as simply a grunt. Can anyone suggest a more respectful term to describe these hardworking individuals? Terry O</p>

            <p>Terrence, we are in need of skilled Craftsmen/Craftswomen or Technicians to perform specialized work. In the past, the traditional route to acquire these skills was through Apprenticeship and Journeyman programs. Even Engineering Graduates used to undergo Graduate Apprenticeship programs. However, there is now a concerning trend of school children graduating with subpar knowledge in Science, Maths, and English, particularly in regions like the UK. The business world is increasingly being dominated by Bean Counters, who prioritize cost-cutting measures. Our society is fixated on short-term gains, focusing on quarterly financial results and instant gratification. In contrast, countries like India and China continue to place a strong emphasis on Science, Maths, and English education. It is not surprising that these countries are showing more positive long-term trends. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>I apologize for starting off with the term "grunt" without realizing its negative connotations in the industrial world. My career began in the oilfields, working on portable drilling rigs in the tropical swamps of Suriname. This is not the place to find a cushy office setup with amenities like a comfortable chair, coffee, computer, and internet. I won't even mention what they call the office club there... Moving on to a more respectful term, "The Floor". I agree with you, Howard, regarding middle management and their short-sighted focus on cutting costs. Initially, outsourcing may seem like a good idea in the first few years, but its long-term effects become apparent over time.</p>

            <p>Terry, We can choose whatever name we want, but in the context of our discussion, it's clear that the importance of this work as a fundamental aspect of asset management is what we're focusing on. I have never been one to dwell on labels like these, as they often reveal more about the individuals using them than the targets of the labels. Vee - The state of education in the UK, combined with issues of overpopulation and asylum, paints a troubling picture for the country. As an outsider, I am deeply concerned. Nonetheless, the question remains: what can we, as a collective of professionals, do to address these challenges? Cheers, Cheers,</p>

            <p>Terry and I both agree that there is a common misconception among middle management types that skilled trades workers, often referred to as "grunt workers," are incapable of handling significant responsibilities. However, my experience has shown that these workers are actually the backbone of many work sites, especially considering the high turnover rate of site managers. Despite initial doubts, it was found that implementing best practices originating from the skilled workers on the floor led to successful task completion. 

I recently encountered a millwright with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering who chose to remain in the skilled trades for better benefits and a hands-on work environment. Similarly, I met an electrician at the same site with a Master's in Electrical Engineering who was working towards a Ph.D. in a slow manner. It's intriguing to see highly educated individuals opting for hands-on work and pursuing higher education simultaneously. - Howard</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to education, a significant shift has been noted in the production of engineers in various countries. Back in 2004, China, India, and Russia led the pack in producing skilled engineers, while the USA and the UK lagged behind. This issue was highlighted at a recent logistics meeting by a General, who pointed out the national security implications of this trend. In response, calls to action have been issued to various professional societies and trade associations. However, the challenge lies in getting companies to pay attention and take necessary steps. Many companies nowadays are primarily focused on financial aspects, often led by individuals who prioritize profits over other factors. This can have negative repercussions on maintenance operations, as bean counters may overlook the importance of investing in maintenance initiatives in favor of short-term cost-saving measures.

It is crucial for companies to understand that a well-functioning maintenance organization is essential for long-term success. Instead of waiting for breakdowns to occur, maintenance teams should focus on proactive measures to prevent failures. This mindset applies not only to manufacturing companies but also to service industries, where reliability and efficiency are key factors in customer satisfaction.

To address the challenges facing the maintenance industry, leaders need to invest in training programs and promote awareness of the importance of preventive maintenance. By actively engaging with technical schools and colleges, companies can inspire the next generation of workers to pursue careers in maintenance. Additionally, internal training programs and apprenticeships can help bridge the gap in skilled labor and ensure a steady workforce for the future.

By taking a proactive approach and investing in maintenance initiatives, companies can improve reliability, reduce downtime, and ultimately enhance their overall profitability. As highlighted by industry leaders like John Fetchko from Cargill, a strong focus on maintenance is crucial for long-term success in any industry.</p>

            <p>It remains a common challenge for many institutions to secure adequate funding for training their students on the latest maintenance preventive equipment. This issue was highlighted in a recent conversation with a so-called "mechanical engineer" who dismissed maintenance work as trivial. This lack of emphasis on skilled trades like millwrighting may explain why the industry is facing difficulties. It appears that some individuals may be hesitant to advance in their career and prefer to keep their heads in the clouds instead of exploring new opportunities.</p>

            <p>In the April 2005 issue of Fabricating and Metalworking magazine, there is an insightful article titled "Editors Forum - Depending on Johnny" that delves into the correlation between education and success in the manufacturing industry. One notable quote from the article highlights America's conundrum: "Our science and education sectors are facing a challenge - as manufacturing becomes more technical, our workforce is becoming less skilled in technical areas." This trend shouldn't come as a surprise, as Vee pointed out. Additionally, the article provides compelling statistics indicating that only 5% of U.S. BS/BA degrees are in engineering, compared to 39% in China and 19% in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan.

            <p>Australia has a history of well-established craft apprenticeship schemes. In the past, both government-owned and private businesses offered training and placement systems. During my previous role, I oversaw the instrument and controls trade training, as well as managed a large training workshop for various other trades. However, many graduates ended up joining external employers, which was seen as a public duty. Unfortunately, these initiatives have been discontinued or sold off. Nevertheless, new government-owned Group Training companies have emerged in Victoria to fill this gap successfully. The challenge now lies in attracting suitable young individuals to apply for these training opportunities.

In today's educational landscape, there is a prevailing belief that success is measured by obtaining a university place. This perception has overshadowed the value of vocational training and apprenticeships. The Gippsland Education Precinct near Monash campus in Victoria aims to guide Year 11 and 12 students towards suitable career pathways. This innovative approach shows promise and could potentially be beneficial in other regions. To learn more about the Gippsland Education Precinct, visit http://gep.vic.edu.au/. Keep an eye on its progress, as it could offer valuable insights for similar initiatives in your area. Ray Beebe</p>

            <p>Ray and Hans, thank you for the insightful article. One can easily find evidence of this by looking at the demographics of post-graduate students in American Universities, particularly in the fields of Science and Engineering. It seems that Australia is also following in the footsteps of the UK by pushing high school graduates into Universities. The government's goal is to increase the number of 'highly-qualified' graduates to stay competitive against Asian countries, aiming for a 50% rate of college graduates. However, this has led to a shortage of skilled workers such as fitters, electricians, and plumbers, as many school leavers are encouraged to pursue higher education instead. As a result, there is a surplus of graduates with degrees that offer few job prospects, leading to employers having to provide additional training for these individuals. This cycle contributes to issues such as youth unemployment and a lack of employable skills in certain industries. It's time for someone to address these concerns and acknowledge the reality of the situation.</p>

            <p>However, a major issue lies in the fact that universities are increasingly operating as businesses. Professional societies like IEEE are making efforts to boost interest in the industry. For instance, my two sons enrolled in the FIRST program, which involves robotics starting from middle school with LEGO Mindstorms, advancing to High School with a postage stamp controller, and eventually competing in a 'firefighting' robotics competition in college. In the USA, initiatives like 'Project Lead the Way' provide technology and engineering programs in high schools and grade schools, offering college credits and laying the foundation for a career in engineering. Technical schools are also becoming popular options for students to start a trade like HVAC or machinist as early as junior year in high school. Nonetheless, there is still a noticeable gap in the availability and quality of tradesmen entering the workforce. This issue was discussed among UAW tradesmen, many of whom have extensive experience but are concerned about the lack of skilled workers in the industry. A related discussion regarding the challenges of finding and retaining skilled tradesmen took place recently, revealing the pressing need for more skilled workers in the industry. The attached document provides further insights into the conversation. I had temporarily stepped back from the discussion due to work on the Maintenance Blogs site but will be resuming my involvement this week due to the increase in emails received.

            <p>During a recent breakfast discussion, a friend mentioned the challenges he faces having to help his daughter with building projects because his son-in-law lacks the necessary skills. This raised the question of whether the son-in-law is open to learning new skills, especially if he works with the friend. Howard, do you think the son-in-law is willing and able to learn from his father-in-law's expertise?</p>

            <p>Dear All, I have always taken pride in being a hardworking team member who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty to ensure that the toughest tasks are completed accurately and on time. Currently, I enjoy utilizing vibration, thermography, and ultrasound technologies in my work. However, despite the advancements in technology, I still believe that the key to achieving quality repairs and successful outcomes lies in the fundamental grunt work. It seems that many individuals in my field are solely motivated by financial gains, lacking the sense of pride that comes from delivering top-notch results. I know there are others out there who share my commitment to excellence, but unfortunately, they seem few and far between in my current workplace. It's disheartening to see that the value of hard work and dedication may be diminishing. Thank you for sharing your perspectives on a topic that resonates with me deeply.</p>

            <p>Did you know that a significant percentage of motor management programs, CMMS applications, and maintenance programs fail to meet their objectives? These alarming statistics highlight the challenges faced by organizations in effectively managing their assets. While these figures may seem shocking, it's important to verify the source and methodology used to arrive at these conclusions. Do you have any information on where these statistics originated from, Bryan Weir? Howard</p>

            <p>In 2003, I collaborated with Terry O'Hanlon on a comprehensive study on Motor Management, focusing on Motor Diagnostics and Motor Health. Additionally, I conducted a study on CMMS as part of the ReliabilityWeb Maintenance Programs, including the UIC-ERC study. These studies, alongside others I have contributed to over the years, were supported by NetExpressUSA surveys. The findings from these studies align with similar research I have been involved in. - Howard</p>

            <p>Hi Howard, I have come across various statistics regarding CMMS failure rates, ranging from 40% to 80% over the years. However, I have yet to find any substantial evidence to support these numbers. It seems challenging to pinpoint an accurate figure. For instance, a study conducted by The Standish Group in Massachusetts in 1998 revealed that 74% of IT projects fail. Similarly, a survey by MRO Today magazine in the US in 2001 found that approximately 80% of CMMS users do not utilize all available functions of their systems. This aligns with a 1999 study by Tompkins Associates, which reported a 70% figure. Despite these findings, the accuracy of these statistics remains questionable. It is concerning that vendors have access to information about their past clients and could potentially gather more accurate data. However, it seems they do not take this approach. I wonder why that is the case.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, while my main focus is on helping young people find sponsored apprenticeship programs, I couldn't help but be intrigued by this topic. In all the discussions and studies, what exactly constitutes a CMMS implementation failure? It can't simply be not using all the features, as that would result in a high failure rate. And it can't be as vague as not meeting requirements, as those should have been established beforehand. Any requirements that come up after the fact are the fault of the project team, not the project's original criteria. So the question remains - what defines a CMMS failure?</p>

            <p>Identifying Signs of CMMS Failure: Look for Signs of Excessive Trial and Error in Implementation Strategies! If a company has switched CMMS systems frequently in a short period, not including vendor upgrades or gradual upgrades like from Excel to Access to a canned application, it is likely facing implementation challenges. Analyzing turnovers of maintenance and IT managers may provide valuable insights into the situation.</p>

            <p>It is crucial to implement a maintenance program prior to operating any plants, facilities, or installations to prevent high failure rates. Should this be mandated by industry codes and standards or laws, akin to the Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) model used in aircraft maintenance? Additionally, could experienced professionals on this forum mentor aspiring students through apprenticeships? Lastly, my perspective on Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) failures has been shared in previous discussions.</p>

            <p>The issue of children's lack of interest in vocational trades may stem from the environment at home. Growing up in the 60s and 70s, I didn't have computers and instead spent my time building things like plastic model kits and tree houses. My parents, like many others in blue-collar households, encouraged this hands-on creativity. Nowadays, kids prefer to play with computers and video games, and parents don't prioritize introducing them to vocational trades. Schools often opt for technology over tools like milling machines or welders due to cost and lack of student interest. Reversing this trend may be challenging, but not impossible.</p>

            <p>Alan, your bleak outlook on the future is certainly understandable, especially considering the trends we've seen in recent years (born in 1948). However, this may simply be a matter of supply and demand. There are already signs of this shift in the UK, with certain industries experiencing a shortage of skilled tradespeople, which should lead to an increase in salaries. As these trades become more lucrative, skilled workers will have more disposable income, making these positions more appealing once again. While computer careers have become increasingly popular, the reality is that these fields will likely only provide substantial earnings for the most exceptional and qualified individuals. The demand for traditional trades such as plumbers, electricians, engineers, and joiners will always be present.</p>

            <p>I agree with you, Alan. My youngest son recently began his college journey in a mechanical engineering program. Surprisingly, his curriculum is mainly focused on electronics and computers in the first year, with limited exposure to mechanical aspects. Even introductory courses like Engineering 101 primarily emphasize electrical and computer skills, as they are deemed essential regardless of the chosen specialization. This trend reflects the current demand in the job market, where proficiency in electrical and computer fields is highly sought after. It seems like we are witnessing a shift towards a digital age sooner than expected. - Danny</p>

            <p>I understand where you're coming from JB. Our backgrounds are quite similar and it seems we share the same perspective on things. I am based in Australia, specifically in the Newcastle and Hunter region, where there is a significant scarcity of skilled workers. Back when I left school about 16 years ago, I was fortunate enough to secure an apprenticeship. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of investment in training programs for young individuals in Australia since the early 1990s. As a result, with the upcoming retirement of the Baby Boomers, there is a noticeable gap in skilled workers to take their place. This has led to companies outsourcing work to countries like Asia and India. While I am frequently approached to return to manual labor for higher pay and fewer responsibilities, I find more fulfillment in my current role in Vibration/Ultrasonic work. Balancing family life with a job I love in a beautiful location is truly rewarding to me. However, this does not address the ongoing labor shortages we are facing. Fortunately, the company I work for is taking steps to bridge this gap by training around 25 apprentices in NDT testing and Condition Monitoring.</p>
