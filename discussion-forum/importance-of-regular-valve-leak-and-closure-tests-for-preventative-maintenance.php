                    <p>When conducting time-based leak/closure tests, two types of valves are typically considered. The first type involves fully closing wellhead valves every 3 months to prevent internal passing. The second type requires partially closing control valves every few months to ensure they will fully close during safety-critical situations, such as plant trips. Have you ever wondered about the reasoning behind the frequency of these preventative maintenance checks?</p>

            <p>A useful guideline to follow is to consider conducting a test for hidden failures. If the majority of valves fail the test, it may indicate that your maintenance interval is too long. Additionally, if the failures can be categorized by area, model, type, or application, it is recommended to further investigate and identify any potential issues.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback. I am interested in understanding the rationale behind starting at 3 months, such as the optimal frequency determined by studies, especially in the context of control valves in a refinery. I am aware of a study on optimizing PSV prepop testing and overhaul, showing that PSVs in corrosive environments like water service are more prone to failure compared to those in clean/dry steam or gas service. Therefore, it is important to prioritize maintenance in the former.</p>

            <p>Is there a specific rationale behind initiating a 3-month duration? Planning for a 3-month timeframe is straightforward, but it is crucial to also factor in potential repercussions of failure, environmental impacts, and compliance with regulations. For instance, when looking at steam boilers, regular testing and documentation of the Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) is required at least once a month. The consequences of a PSV that fails to lift are widely recognized within the power generation sector.</p>

            <p>When it comes to hidden functions, the relationship between required availability, failure rate (MTBF), and test frequency is crucial. The availability on demand is determined by the level of risk we are willing to accept, which is influenced by various factors outlined in a Quantified Risk Analysis. Understanding qualitative risks is also essential in this process. Chapter 7 of my book delves into these risk aspects. Testing for hidden functions is detailed on pages 32-39, with a specific focus on equation 3.13. If you will be attending RCM-2006, I will be presenting a paper on Detective Maintenance that addresses these topics. You can also find a paper on this subject on the Reliabilityweb.com website.

            <p>Hello Josh,

I hope everything is going well for you and that your company is off to a successful start in the New Year. I have a question regarding the optimal frequency for starting at 3 months. Is there any research or study available on this topic, specifically in the context of control valves in a refinery?

Building on Vee's response regarding testing for hidden failures, it is crucial to consider the relationship between the desired availability, failure rate, and inspection frequency. In SAE JA1012, a formula is used to determine the frequency of inspection based on the failure rates of the protective device and the protected function. This calculation is specific to each plant's operating context and management requirements.

It is important to note that the formula is designed for situations with one device and random failure mode. Factors such as multiple devices in series, parallel configurations, and voting systems need to be taken into account when determining the failure finding frequency.

Ultimately, the formula aims to manage the level of unavailability within a tolerable risk level for the company. However, when considering economic consequences, the calculation may need to be adjusted to assess the likelihood of monetary impacts rather than tolerable risk levels.

I believe Vee will elaborate on this further during his upcoming seminar. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

            <p>Josh, let me provide some clarification on the installation of protective devices on equipment such as pipelines, pressure vessels, and centrifugal compressors. These protective devices can also be part of larger systems like Fire Detection or Emergency Shutdown. When it comes to static equipment, the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of the protected equipment is crucial, as it is usually much greater than that of the protective device. The MTBF specifically pertains to the fail-to-danger failure mode, and not fail-to-safe or combined failure modes.

Additionally, it's important to consider tolerable risk criteria for all types of risks, whether related to safety, production, or reputation. Qualitative risks require judgement based on company policy, while safety risks can be quantified through Quantified Risk Assessment studies. The consequences of failure can vary based on the specific situation, such as the impact of a Gas Turbine blade breaking in different environments.

In terms of assigning availability for items that could lead to production loss or impact safety, availability ranges typically fall between 85%-95% for production-related items and 95%-99% for safety systems. Each situation is unique and must align with company policies. It's important to thoroughly understand the principles involved rather than relying solely on tables, software, or standards.</p>

            <p>Are there any guidelines on how to determine the testing frequency for different scenarios, particularly for wellhead valves? Our technical standard recommends a 3-month frequency for wellhead valves, but does not provide a basis for this recommendation. It is crucial to get the frequency right as internal leaks can impact safety and the environment. While a 3-month frequency for leak/closure tests that require a well shutdown may work for larger fields, it can be disruptive for smaller fields with fewer wells (<10). In such cases, a well shutdown for testing could result in a significant loss of production. One possible solution could be to increase production the following day to make up for the lost output, but this may not be favored by reservoir experts due to its long-term impact. Is it possible to double the testing frequency or align it with the annual well shutdown, with a valid rationale?</p>

            <p>Josh, have you heard of the OREDA database? It is a vast repository of data gathered from Oil & Gas Production companies operating in the North Sea over the past two decades. This electronic database is exclusive to participating companies, but limited data sets are periodically published in book form by DNV in Norway. These books, priced at around $200 each, cover various equipment classes and can be found on the DNV website or through a simple Google search on OREDA or SINTEF (the project managers). Other databases like ESREDA and IEEE are also beneficial depending on your specific data needs, but they come with a hefty production cost. 

When it comes to gathering performance data from wellhead valve tests, do you analyze it to enhance maintenance strategies? Many companies simply file this data away without utilizing it for improvements. I have personally utilized test data to support new test frequencies for equipment like wellheads, gas detectors, and relief valves, but it required extensive analysis. It's crucial to approach any changes to test frequencies with caution as they can impact technical integrity and safety standards significantly. Wellhead valves play a critical role in safety and must be handled with the utmost care and consideration.</p>

            <p>Josh, I'm pleased to hear that you're currently just collecting information and not making any decisions to alter test frequencies. When it comes to defining test failure, categorizing tests as 'pass' or 'fail' allows you to calculate failure rates and mean time between failures (MTBF). This data is crucial in determining the appropriate test frequencies. Additionally, the QRA output is needed to determine the necessary availability. Perhaps it's best if we conclude this discussion here as it appears to be specific to your situation. The forum may not be the appropriate platform for further discussion. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Vee, Your comment was unnecessary. It's important to grasp the principles thoroughly instead of merely relying on software or standards. The RCM standard, developed by professionals, is a valuable resource with a wealth of information. Let's not try to reinvent the wheel every time we discuss a topic; instead, let's find simpler ways to approach them. Remember, there is no magic wand - just a lot of hard work and dedication.</p>

            <p>Vee, it seems like there might have been a misunderstanding of the main point I was trying to communicate in my previous post. I urge you to take the time to carefully read through this post instead of dismissing it outright. 

Qualitative risks are influenced by various factors, and delving into them in detail would require more time than is available here; hence why I directed you to consult my book. However, asserting that tolerable risks cannot be assigned to them is, in my opinion, not acceptable. It was never stated that tolerable risks cannot be applied to strictly operational or economic risks. To suggest otherwise would misrepresent the previous statements made.

The crux of my argument is this: when safety and environmental risks are at play, there can be no compromise. You either acknowledge and manage the existing risks or you do not. Conversely, with economic or operational risks, the approach shifts slightly. One can continue with a risk-based strategy, which is beneficial, or opt for an optimization approach. This approach involves quantifying the risk in a tangible monetary value and determining the trade-offs. It revolves around comparing the costs of testing against the costs of potential consequences to find the optimal frequency in handling the risks.

It's challenging to fully explain these concepts in a brief overview, but I believe this highlights the fundamental approach. Personally, I have found this optimization approach to be more effective in dealing with economic consequences of failures.</p>
