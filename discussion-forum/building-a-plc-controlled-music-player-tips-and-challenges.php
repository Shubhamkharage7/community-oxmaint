                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings everyone! It's great to finally contribute to this forum after being a silent observer for a while, thanks to my job. I have some experience in building physical computers and a basic understanding of programming. However, I have discovered that I learn best through hands-on experience rather than passive learning methods like reading or watching videos. To challenge myself, I have decided to create a music box. Size is not a major concern for me, and I have already made some progress in planning the project.

My setup includes a single 1734 aent, an ib4, and an ob8, all powered by a 120vac-24vdc 10amp rectifier connected to a wall outlet. This setup replicates the basic configuration used at my workplace. 

I am currently facing a challenge in converting a push button into a play button and creating an output in the form of a looping track played through speakers. Any suggestions or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your input!</p>

            <p>In order to effectively control the 1734, it is important to provide more detailed information. What logic have you implemented so far? Glass_ST mentioned a challenge in changing a push button into a play button for a looping track on speakers. Before adding a "play" button, it's crucial to clarify the output it will control. To kickstart this exciting project, share your vision for its operation, specify the PLC model you plan to utilize, and mention the software at your disposal. This could turn out to be an enjoyable and engaging project.</p>

            <p>I am currently puzzled by the process of converting a push button into a play button on a system. Can you explain how to make the system switch to "play" mode when an off pushbutton is briefly pressed, and then remain in "play" mode even after the pushbutton is released?</p>

            <p>A significant amount of additional information will be required before proceeding further. What is powering the 1734? What logic have you developed? Prior to implementing a "play" button, more details are necessary to determine what the output is controlling. Prior to diving into programming, it is essential to outline the functionality you envision, specify the PLC you intend to use, and disclose the software at your disposal. This project has the potential to be quite enjoyable.

To power the 1734, I intend to use a 120VAC-24VDC rectifier, although the specific model is yet to be determined. A 5-amp rectifier should provide ample power for my requirements. I plan on using Studio 5000 for programming.

While I have yet to write any code, the concept in my mind is rather straightforward: the 120VAC input goes to the rectifier, which then supplies power to the 1734 and 4-8 push buttons (the exact number is still undecided). Each push button serves as a separate input connected to an XIC with a latch for output. The latch is set and reset by either PB4 or PB8 (depending on the quantity chosen), where PB4/8 also closes a normally closed contact with the other push buttons to act as an electrical and software stop. The latch triggers a change in state in an XIC, activating the output signal to play a song (the song varies based on the initial push button). To prevent multiple outputs, each output verifies against an XIO to ensure no other outputs are active.

I hope this explanation provides clarity. I sometimes struggle with articulating my thoughts, as it feels like the elves from South Park: Step 1 Buy parts, Step 2 ???, Step 3 Enjoy. Any initial feedback on my plan? Once I have the initial program completed, I will share it.</p>

            <p>drbitboy inquired: How can I program the system so that when it is turned off and a momentary pushbutton is pressed, it transitions to "play" mode and remains in that mode even after the button is released? The process of transitioning to 'play' mode appears straightforward, but I'm unsure of how to enable the PLC to generate sound. Are there specific hardware requirements and programs necessary for this task? Additionally, the input and output cards are connected to the 1734 backplane, so I need to determine how to establish communication between the output card and other components.</p>

            <p>parky expressed concern about a 120v AC to 24v DC 5 amp rectifier, hoping it functions as a power supply. This setup is being wired on a desk at home, where caution is exercised with anything above 120v.

            <p>This project requires a specialized approach, as it involves playing audio files based on specific conditions. Typically, PLCs are not used for this purpose unless it is for a unique application, such as assisting visually impaired operators on assembly lines. To achieve this, a PLC capable of Modbus RTU communication, like a micrologix 1100/1400, is necessary. For those seeking a Modbus RTU MP3 player, platforms like Aliexpress offer suitable options, like a generic MP3 player with RS485 capabilities. Additionally, options like the Sparkfun MP3 Player, which supports up to 255 tracks, or Halloween prop controllers that can be triggered externally, are worth exploring. Overall, this is an unconventional industrial application, requiring skills in Modbus, Serial, or Binary output control alongside knowledge of MP3 device integration.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to control a 1734-AENT remote IO module (Point I/O) with a PLC, it's important to know the number of inputs and outputs needed. Additionally, having the right software installed on your PC is crucial. While Studio5k is a popular option, it can be on the pricier side. Let's first identify your hardware requirements before diving into the programming process.</p>

            <p>In response to a query from geniusintraining about programming a 1734-AENT remote IO module with a PLC, the suggestion was made to focus on hardware requirements first. Determining the number of inputs and outputs needed, along with the software being used on a PC, such as Studio 5000, was advised. While Studio 5000 is a popular option, its cost may be a factor to consider. 

It was suggested that building a system from scratch, rather than relying on a pre-made trainer, would be beneficial. With a requirement for 8 inputs and 8 outputs, the question of whether the compact 5370 PLC controller would be suitable arose. The affordability of Studio 5000 was also discussed, prompting a query about cheaper alternatives that could be used for programming. While Studio 5000 is currently available at work, finding a cost-effective solution for home use was considered.</p>

            <p>I recently delved into Studio 5000 at work and wanted to share my progress. Currently, I am facing a challenge in configuring a blocking bit to avoid simultaneous activation of multiple Play_signal bits. After some experimentation, I have devised a method that involves using MOV instructions to move a number to an EQU, creating a more streamlined system.</p>

            <p>I must admit, these push buttons are quite pricey. One approach is to combine all outputs onto a memory bit and use the NOT memory bit in each rung. This way, once an output is latched, no other output can be activated until the reset button is pressed. The first rung should also include an unlatch of the memory bit associated with the pressed button (M21 in this case). To ensure output latches are activated, incorporate a NOT contact in all rungs. It is not necessary to use NOT contacts for all other buttons unless there is concern about multiple buttons being pressed simultaneously within the PLC's scan time.

            <p>Glass_ST mentioned that after spending time working with Studio 5000 at work, they have made progress. Their current challenge is preventing multiple Play_signal bits from activating simultaneously. They have come up with a solution involving using a blocking bit. Another idea is to simplify by NOR-ing all Play_signal_OP_n bits to a single coil and using that coil's operand to energize each push button. In the case of both push buttons being pressed in the same scan cycle, Kernighan's algorithm can be used as a workaround for this private project. However, it may not be suitable for an industrial application.</p>

            <p>Want to explore new possibilities without additional hardware? With access to an HMI and a PLC processor (no I/O required), you can create innovative projects using simulation. By utilizing an HMI or simulator, you can design logic for processes like batching or robotics without the need for actual I/O. By simulating the process with a combination of HMI and PLC, you can animate and run the project smoothly. This method has been successfully used in various projects, with simulation software like Prosis or Pics. By simulating with around 2,000 I/O points, modifications can be made before visiting the site, saving time and ensuring a smooth commissioning process. By mapping real I/O to internal bits and utilizing simulation code in PLC blocks, you can debug and fine-tune the process efficiently. This approach minimizes the need for on-site modifications during commissioning.</p>

            <p>When you mentioned bits, I initially thought you were referring to binary digits, which made me realize I may not be very bright. To further understand this concept, take a look at Boolean Logic. It is a formal concept that is likely familiar to you based on your code. In Boolean logic, there are three key operators: AND, OR, and NOT.

AND is a binary operator that requires two operands to evaluate. In ladder logic, it is represented by placing two contacts in series on the same rung or branch. If both contacts are true, the output rung will be true.

OR is another binary operator that is implemented in ladder logic by placing two contacts in parallel. If either contact, or both contacts, are true, the output rung will be true.

NOT is a unary operator that operates on a single operand. In ladder logic, it is implemented using the -|/|- contact, also known as Normally Closed or NC. It can be argued that this, along with Normally Open or NO contacts, are essentially AND operators as they combine the true/false state of their input rung with the operand evaluation.

All other operations in Boolean logic are built on these fundamental operators. For example, NOR is a combination of NOT and OR. DeMorgan's Laws state that "NOT (a OR b)" is equivalent to "(NOT a) AND (NOT b)." Therefore, NOR can be implemented as a series of NOT contacts.

By understanding these fundamental concepts, you can effectively apply Boolean logic to your programming tasks.</p>

            <p>After analyzing my work, it seems that I have created several NOT gates. There is probably a function in Studio that can achieve the same result, but the AND, OR, and NOT functions are typically used as outputs. How can I convert one of these functions into an input? While it may not significantly impact a program of this scale, it is valuable practice to comprehend these tools (developed by individuals with far greater expertise than my own) in order to enhance my performance in my role.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, taking a longer route can be more beneficial than creating a complex function. It all boils down to how others perceive your code when troubleshooting. For instance, the use of "NOT" bits can be likened to a relay system, where the coils act as relays and the contacts serve as interlocks derived from these relays. While it may be tempting to streamline the process by implementing indirect addressing in a loop to reduce the amount of code, it doesn't necessarily improve speed since it still has to iterate through the same information repeatedly.

Consider a scenario where you have 10 variables representing outputs, each corresponding to a specific integer value in a register. Instead of creating 10 separate rungs with comparisons for each output, you can utilize indirect addressing to achieve the same result in just a couple of rungs. This approach makes it easier to handle multiple outputs based on the value stored in the variable without the need for extensive comparisons.

As seen in the example, assigning a value of 2 to the variable activates output 2, while assigning 4 activates output 4, and so forth. While this method may seem daunting for beginners, mastering the capabilities of PLCs opens up various efficient programming techniques. Remember, there are always multiple ways to achieve the same outcome in PLC programming.</p>

            <p>Glass_ST asked how they could utilize a-( )-coil instruction to create an input. To achieve this, one must place the a-( )-coil instruction at the end of a rung, with that rung serving as the coil's input rung, and utilizing an internal memory bit as its operand. In the event that the rung state is True during the evaluation of the coil instruction, a value of 1 will be stored in the internal memory bit. Conversely, if the rung state is False during evaluation, a value of 0 will be stored in the internal memory bit. This internal memory bit can then be used as an operand in a single contact on subsequent rungs to retain the Boolean result, eliminating the need to recreate complex Boolean logic with multiple contacts in series and/or parallel.

It is important to note that the user program can only read and write 1s and 0s to memory bits based on its logic. The memory in a PLC is categorized into three primary groups: input memory, output memory, and internal memory. The user program does not directly read physical inputs, but instead reads memory bits that mirror the states of the PLC's physical inputs. These memory bits are updated from the incoming electrical signals of the physical inputs by the PLC's operating system independently of the user program's execution. Similarly, the user program does not directly control physical outputs; it writes to memory bits representing the desired state of the physical outputs, which are then interpreted by the PLC operating system and converted into electrical signals for the physical outputs. Internal memory serves the purpose of allowing the user program to store Boolean calculations from one rung to the next, and even across scan cycles.</p>

            <p>Glass_ST inquired about using a specific method to create an input. The key point to understand is that inputs and outputs are not physically created, as all instructions in a PLC simply read or manipulate memory. Whether it's an XIC (examine if closed) or XIO (examine if open) contact instruction, the focus is on the address of the memory bit and its value of 1 or 0. This applies to coils as well, which can even overwrite the value in an input memory bit. This can result in different interpretations by later contacts until the PLC system re-scans the physical input state and updates the memory bit accordingly.</p>

            <p>Glass_ST commented that their brain was hurting after attempting to learn PLC programming. If you truly want to learn, then hands-on experience is key. Consider downloading RSLogix Micro Starter Lite and RSEmulate 500, which is a free tool. This software may not be exactly like logic 5000, but it will get you started without the need for a physical PLC. PLC programming revolves around timing, with the scan cycle acting as the clock. Check out this video series for more information. The Boolean aspect of programming is considered the more straightforward part of the process.</p>
