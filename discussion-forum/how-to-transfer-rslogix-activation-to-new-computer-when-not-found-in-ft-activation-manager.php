            <p>If you originally used a master disk for your license and are now utilizing FT Activation Manager, please reach out to Activation Support. They can assist in transferring your license number to an Activation File. I recently went through this process and received a product sheet via email containing my Serial Number and a New Product Key Code. After waiting one hour for a system update, I proceeded with the regular activation for a new product. Simply use FT Manager to generate a Host ID and XML file, visit the website to upload the file, and input your serial number and product key code to complete the process. It is recommended to submit your request through the Chat feature, which requires logging in. Avoid rehosting your activations until this process is completed to prevent removal of your current activation files.</p>

            <p>John Calderwood inquired about the functionality of the licensed software on the laptop. To confirm the activations, it is important to verify if the programs are running smoothly. Locate the directories where the activations are stored and ensure the activation manager is still linked to the correct location. I am confident that these programs have been properly licensed as I have been utilizing them for the past 2 years without any issues. The FTA manager is currently referencing the directory containing the ftasystem.lic file, which may be the activation file.</p>

Upon reviewing the attached FTA manager screenshot, it appears that there is no activation present. However, I have been able to use these software programs without any issues, leading me to believe that they are indeed activated or licensed. As for the old method, I am unsure as I have not utilized it.

I believe that this is more than just a client-server setup, as I am able to access these software applications from any location without the need to connect to a server.</p>

            <p>If your original software license was tied to a master disk but you are now using FT Activation Manager, you can have your license number transferred to an Activation File by contacting Activation Support. I recently went through this process and received a product sheet via email containing my Serial Number and a New Product Key Code. After waiting for an hour for system updates, I completed the activation process for a new product. Using FT Manager, I generated a Host ID and XML file, uploaded it to the website, and inputted my serial number and product key code to finish the activation. It's important to note that this request was made through the Chat feature and requires login credentials. Do not rehost your activations until the transfer is complete to avoid losing your current activation files. Feel free to ask for more information on this process. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Indeed, your observation is correct - the screenshot provided does not display any activations. The file names should ideally commence with "HOSTDISK_SERIAL_NUM=......" In addition, upon opening the file with notepad, the VENDOR_STRING will reveal the serial number and product name. To further verify the software's authenticity, navigate to <Help>, <about RSLogix> within the software package where the version and license serial number should be visible.</p>

            <p>When examining your screen shot, it is important to look for file names that begin with "HOSTDISK_SERIAL_NUM=......". In these files, the VENDOR_STRING contains both the serial number and product name when opened in notepad. Additionally, the <Help> and <About RSLogix> section of the software package will display the version and license serial number.

In the Help-About section, you will find information such as the version, license holder, serial number, activation drive, and product prefix. To locate the necessary information, check the .LIC file in the activation path. The .LIC file typically includes details like the server, vendor, increment, and product information.</p>

            <p>Based on the information displayed, it appears that you do not have a Factory Talk license and most likely have the EV Move version. To activate the program, navigate to your program files located in rockwell software/utilites/move activation/, select "C drive" and choose another drive for activation (such as a USB or hard drive) before clicking OK. This process will initiate the "Move" feature to search for activations without causing any data loss. You will then be able to view and transfer any licenses or choose to cancel with no changes made.</p>

            <p>Duckman recommended checking for Factory Talk licenses by accessing the EV Move version in your program files under rockwell software/utilites/move activation/. Once there, select "C drive" and choose another drive for activation transfer, such as a USB or hard drive, before clicking OK. This process, known as "Move," will scan for activations without causing any data loss. You can then choose to transfer licenses or cancel without any changes. To ensure a smooth reformatting process, it is advisable to transfer the activation from C: to another drive and then back again following the proper procedure.</p>

            <p>Before formatting your device, it is essential to understand that your .Lic file may be an older version. To successfully move these files, you must have a connected drive. Older Activation files are compatible with software versions up to 19, while version 20 and above will require the use of FT Activation Manager. If you need to transfer activation to a USB drive, you will need to utilize Evmovecf. This tool can be downloaded for free (see attachment). For further assistance, visit the Rockwell website and navigate to the Support section where you can access Live Chat for immediate help. If you qualify for an upgrade, you can request to update your older License file.</p>

            <p>In order to view the license, Leonunez, I expected to see RSLogix 500/5000/Linx software. Typically, licenses are transferred from the C drive to a floppy disk, serving as a Master Disc, and then copied onto a new laptop or computer. Do you have a floppy drive accessible? If so, plug it in and attempt to copy the licenses onto a floppy disc. Alternatively, you can try using a Virtual Floppy for this process.</p>

To transfer activation to a jump drive, Evmovecf is necessary. This tool can be obtained as a free download (see Attachment). For assistance in upgrading your older License file, visit Rockwell's website and navigate to the Support section. Click on "Get Support Now" and proceed to the Live Chat tab for further assistance. If you are eligible for an upgrade, you can request it there. If you are considering transferring the files to a server within your network, it is recommended to use EvmoveW or EvMoveCF for this purpose.</p>

            <p>I have never transferred licenses except through floppy disks or Virtual Floppy. You can use EvmoveCF to detect other drives. If additional drives are found, click OK and take note of the destination. I recommend using a floppy disk for the transfer, but it may not work if it is not a Master Disc floppy.</p>

            <p>Duckman suggests using EvmoveCF to relocate licenses onto different drives. It's recommended to prioritize transferring them onto a Master Disc floppy. Note that licenses cannot be transferred to an empty disk or folder.</p>

            <p>I am confident that transferring old activations to a USB stick or network location is possible. This method proved useful when replacing outdated computers at my plant, especially since the new computers lack a floppy drive. Personally, I opted to use an external hard drive formatted as a local drive, which may have made a difference in the process. However, the specifics remain uncertain.</p>
