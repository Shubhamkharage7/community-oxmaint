                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>With over 25 years of experience using AB SLC, Micro, and Logix PLC's, I have a strong grasp of their programming environment. While I have a lot of reusable programming and receive repeat business for similar equipment, I am open to exploring cost-saving opportunities in the I/O hardware department. One option I am considering is Automation Direct I/O, known for being affordable, user-friendly, and quick to deliver.

Specifically, I am interested in the Automation Direct Stride I/O, which boasts Modbus TCP capability. I am curious about the compatibility of this I/O with CompactLogix, which is also Modbus TCP compatible as a client or server. Although AB may have reservations about the synchronization of update times, I believe it is worth investigating further.

If you have experience integrating Automation Direct Stride I/O with CompactLogix or similar systems, I would greatly appreciate hearing about your results. Thank you in advance for any insights you can provide.</p>

            <p>After using AB SLC, Micro, and Logix PLCs for over 25 years, I have become quite adept at the programming environment. Despite being set in my ways due to the extensive programming I re-use, I am open to exploring cost-saving opportunities, particularly in the realm of I/O hardware. I have recently taken a closer look at Automation Direct I/O options, such as the Automation Direct Stride I/O with Modbus TCP capability. I am curious about the compatibility of this system with a CompactLogix, which also supports Modbus TCP communication.

Have any of you tried integrating Automation Direct I/O with a CompactLogix PLC? Despite potential skepticism from AB about non-synchronous updates, I believe it is a worthwhile endeavor to explore. If you have attempted this, I would love to hear about your experiences and results.

In my own programming practices, I have found that even with Rockwell claiming synchronous updates, I still mirror I/O to designated status bits and words within my program. This approach simplifies the process of replacing limit switches and sensors. Additionally, I have leveraged off-line testing through simulation, ranging from basic inputs driving outputs in a subroutine to comprehensive process simulations using high-end software packages.

By the way, age is merely a reflection of one's willingness to embrace new ideas and technologies. Let's continue to share our experiences and insights in the field of PLC programming.</p>

            <p>johnd_125 shared his extensive experience of over 25 years working with various PLCs such as AB SLC, Micro, and Logix. Despite being comfortable with his current programming environment and having a library of reusable code, he is open to exploring cost-saving options for I/O hardware. One such option he is considering is Automation Direct's Stride I/O, known for its affordability and ease of use, especially with Modbus TCP capability.

He is curious about the compatibility of Stride I/O with CompactLogix, which also supports Modbus TCP. While traditional PLC manufacturers like AB may downplay the idea, he believes it is worth investigating for potential benefits. He seeks insights from others who have used this setup and their outcomes.

For those considering EtherNet IP, johnd_125 suggests looking into Beckhoff's BK9105 bus coupler and their "KL" series I/O modules for seamless integration into RSLogix. While the range of I/O modules may be limited to the "KL" series, they offer a wide variety at cost-effective prices with a compact design for efficient use in control panels.

Beckhoff may also have solutions for Modbus TCP, reflecting their comprehensive range of offerings for various scenarios. Those looking to expand I/O on a RSLogix platform with Beckhoff I/O have multiple options to explore, with the BK9105 being one potential approach.</p>

            <p>I have experience using the ControLogix system in conjunction with Beckhoff IO for a compact subsea application. It is functional, but requires the use of KL modules. One challenge is determining the length of the connection due to varying card lengths and headers. Troubleshooting individual channels is difficult, as removing a single card from the remote IO results in the loss of the entire string. In hindsight, I would opt for Beckhoff or CODESYS PLC paired with Beckhoff IO for a more seamless and reliable solution.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the recommendations. To test the capabilities, I decided to explore the Automation Direct Stride I/O line. I purchased an 8-channel thermocouple module (SIO-MB08THMS) and a Combination Discrete Module (SIO-MB12CDR), and set them up on a benchtop for testing. The configuration process was straightforward, with helpful documentation provided with each module.

I connected the thermocouple module to a Wonderware application using the DASMBTCP driver in the SMC. While I had limited experience with Modbus, I managed to figure it out with some effort. I then proceeded to connect both Stride modules to a 1769-L2 CompactLogix using the Modbus TCP Client AOI from RA. This required some additional troubleshooting, but with the help of a manual and online resources, I successfully integrated the modules with the PLC.

As a simple test, I linked an output of the Stride to one of its inputs, and replicated the same setup on the local I/O of the CompactLogix. The results showed a significant difference in response time, with the Stride I/O performing much faster at 170ms compared to the local I/O delay of 43 seconds. Despite encountering a limitation in adjusting the poll interval, I was overall satisfied with the performance for most applications.

Additionally, the Stride modules feature a watchdog function, which would be beneficial in real-world scenarios. In conclusion, while the Stride I/O with CL setup may feel somewhat basic, it proved to be reliable. For future projects involving non-Rockwell I/O, I would consider exploring Ethernet IP options from manufacturers like Beckhoff and Wago, as suggested. Thank you for your insights.</p>

            <p>The AOI has a poll interval that I attempted to decrease to 10ms, but it only accepted a minimum of 80ms for some unknown reason. I will need to further investigate this limitation. Despite this, a poll interval of 170ms is still satisfactory for most applications. It is important to note that the minimum limit of 80ms is hardcoded for a specific purpose. Each poll interval requires a minimum of 8 scans for reliable processing. To achieve a 10ms poll interval, the task rate must be 1.2ms, which is lower than the AOI execution time of approximately 2ms in Compactlogix from what I recall.</p>

            <p>The potential savings are attractive, but the ease of use is essential. When comparing prices, it ultimately comes down to what you are comparing it to. At $172 USD for 16 points of I/O, the STRIDE modules offer a competitive price point. However, it's important to note that these modules are not expandable. If you only require 16 points, the STRIDE modules are a cost-effective option compared to Point I/O. But if you need more points, the savings may not be as significant. Despite this, the STRIDE modules are still a convenient choice to consider.</p>

            <p>User johnd_125 expressed gratitude for the input and shared their experience with the Automation Direct Stride I/O modules, including an 8 channel thermocouple module (SIO-MB08THMS) and a Combination Discrete Module (SIO-MB12CDR). They found the setup process straightforward and particularly appreciated the minimal but useful documentation provided with each module.

Connecting the thermocouple module to a Wonderware application using the DASMBTCP driver was a bit challenging due to limited experience with Modbus, but manageable overall. They also successfully linked both Stride modules to a 1769-L2 CompactLogix using the Modbus TCP Client AOI from RA, with a bit more difficulty but with the help of a manual and a YouTube tutorial.

In a test scenario, they compared the response times of the Stride I/O and the CompactLogix Local I/O, noting a significant difference in delay times. Despite encountering some limitations with the poll interval in the AOI, they found the performance of the Stride I/O module satisfactory for most applications.

Additionally, the Stride modules feature a watchdog function that would be beneficial in real-world applications. While acknowledging a somewhat "cheap and dirty" aspect to using Stride I/O with CompactLogix, they expressed interest in exploring Ethernet IP options from other brands, such as Beckhoff and Wago.

In a separate inquiry, the user sought assistance with configuring temperature and distance sensors with the Stride Master Module in Studio 5000 for a compactlogix. Despite the lack of clear documentation on this, they were hopeful for guidance from the community to help navigate this process effectively.</p>
