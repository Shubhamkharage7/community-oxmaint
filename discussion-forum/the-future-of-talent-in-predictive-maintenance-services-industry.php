                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Currently, I am employed by a company that specializes in offering comprehensive Predictive Maintenance (PdM) services to various industrial clients. In the past, part of my role involved staying up-to-date with industry competitors, recognizing emerging trends, and being knowledgeable about the offerings in the market. In the past, there was a shift towards outsourcing the PdM function to external experts rather than developing internal resources. Is this trend still prevalent today? I have heard that PMCI was recently acquired by SKF, and it seems that SES Technical may have been purchased by Timken Services. Both of these acquired companies had talented teams that are likely enhancing their new organizations. When I first entered the industry in the late 70s, machine condition monitoring was a relatively unknown concept, understood only by a few individuals who recognized its importance for business success. However, times have changed, and now most business leaders understand the significant value that PdM services bring to their profitability. If the trend continues towards outsourcing our services, will we see a repeat of the acquisition processes that took place in the 90s, such as Emerson's acquisition of CSI, Rockwell's acquirement of Entek-IRD, GE's purchase of Bentley NV, and SKF's absorption of DI? Furthermore, how will this potential trend impact new talent entering our industry? - Gary Forsythe</p>

            <p>Hi Gary, I've noticed a trend where specialized services like Predictive Maintenance (PdM), turnaround management, and reliability services are increasingly being outsourced to third-party providers. This can be attributed to various factors, but one common reason cited is companies' reluctance to invest in training employees for future roles. Often, once trained, employees use their new skills to enhance their resumes and quickly move on to different positions. I have included a link to a recent article I wrote discussing the labor shortage problem in the UK. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how this issue is unfolding in your region. How are you handling the resource crisis?</p>
