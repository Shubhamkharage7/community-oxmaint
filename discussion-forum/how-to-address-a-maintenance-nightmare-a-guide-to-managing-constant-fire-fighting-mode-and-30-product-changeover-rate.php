            <p>Hello, fellow Millwright. It is crucial for management to embrace and endorse the shift towards a new maintenance philosophy. Securing budgetary support is essential to achieving this goal; it is unavoidable. Without it, the company may remain stuck in a reactive state, risking being outpaced by competitors due to tight margins. This negativity can breed a sense of despair among employees, leading to apathy and mistrust towards leadership. This situation is reminiscent of past experiences in similar industries. It appears that some manufacturing sectors are stuck in a reactive mindset, possibly due to misconceptions about cost-effectiveness or prioritization of production over equipment maintenance. It is vital to rally like-minded individuals to your cause. Are there allies who share your perspective? Where does the current maintenance management team stand on this issue? Do you have connections within management that you can persuade to support this change? Consider introducing them to relevant groups or reliable resources to help them understand the benefits of a new maintenance approach.</p>

            <p>While it has been noted that there may be limitations in budget, introducing a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) can serve as a beneficial starting point. An effective approach toward fostering a cultural shift is the formation of small "continuous improvement teams (CIT)" focused on addressing specific problems within a designated area or category. For example, establishing a CIT dedicated to addressing downtime issues for a particular machine or section can yield valuable insights and recommendations for preventive maintenance practices and potential plant-wide solutions. By appointing a maintenance professional or operator to lead the team consisting of 6-10 floor personnel, and equipping them with the necessary tools to measure their progress using production data, significant improvements can be achieved.</p>

            <p>Dear Old Millwright,

I see that you have a 30% changeover rate, indicating that your equipment is being utilized for multiple product types. I suggest delving into Shigeo Shingo's book on Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) to minimize downtime during changeovers, setups, and conversions. Start by focusing on improving one machine and allowing your team to apply the newly gained knowledge. From my experience, I've found that the key to enhancing equipment performance lies in the continuous improvement of your team. 

Best regards,</p>

            <p>Currently, I find myself in a challenging situation during changeovers at Rolly On. The process involves a mix of astrology, scavenging for parts that often need to be custom-made, and collaborating with QA to ensure precision. While the dies are small and can be changed quickly with all the parts in place, tuning them to the material and tolerance level is a meticulous process. The SOP I follow includes securing the dies into position, adjusting heat and speed, and hoping for compliance with QA standards.

Despite being aware of SMED and other techniques, I feel that I am far from an efficient changeover process. Any additional suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Previous attempts to use locating pins have failed due to the heat and size of the dies. Additionally, the unpredictable nature of the material adds another layer of complexity.

Each changeover brings about apprehension and uncertainty as there is a constant fear of discovering more issues or broken parts. To add to the pressure, we are urgently seeking to tackle a lengthy list of tasks. If I can successfully navigate through this challenging period, I may have material for a potential best-selling book in the future.</p>

            <p>As an experienced millwright, I understand the challenges you are facing. I encountered a similar situation last autumn when maintenance was seen as a reactive measure rather than a proactive solution. The resulting downtime was significant and often led to additional issues in the long run. While I don't have a quick fix, I can share that through hard work, we were able to make significant improvements. This has provided me with valuable data to present to senior management regarding the need for resources like equipment, funding, and manpower.

One challenge I faced was being given an outdated CMMS program from the 1980s, which proved to be more trouble than it was worth. Spending hours each day inputting data would have taken months to complete. To navigate this, I focused on: A) thorough documentation; B) demonstrating to financial decision-makers the direct impact of parts availability on downtime; C) fostering teamwork among staff; and D) instilling a sense of ownership in both maintenance and operations teams.

By prioritizing operator training and taking control of parts supply and departmental finances, we were able to reduce downtime from hours to minutes per month. However, sourcing rare parts for my European equipment remains a challenge without dedicated purchasing support. Despite still facing challenges, I remain committed to resolving them and wish you success in your own efforts. By staying diligent, you can overcome the obstacles ahead.</p>

            <p>When I first started working in the 80s, I faced similar challenges with no assistance for change. The key is to begin by creating thorough documentation. I initiated a system of keeping files on each equipment, listing necessary repairs that could be continually updated, detailing completed repairs, and identifying the root cause of the issues. It is crucial to educate maintenance personnel on proper problem documentation and utilize a database or CMMS to accurately enter and track repair information. Identifying and addressing recurring issues is essential. Despite working at a small company, it took me a decade to establish a solid preventive maintenance program and gain management support, without the aid of a large team. We have successfully reduced maintenance downtime to less than 6% of the work schedule by tracking all downtime and addressing problematic areas promptly. The pillars of my success were meticulous documentation and a focus on prevention.</p>

            <p>When striving to improve workplace safety and culture, it is important to manage expectations to avoid frustration. This process is a gradual cultural shift that takes time and should be approached with baby steps. Safety should always be the top priority to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of their shift. It is crucial to identify key priorities and consider the financial impact of losing them, which can be eye-opening. Remember, changing a company's culture is a journey that requires patience and persistence. Good luck on your journey to creating a safer and more positive work environment!</p>

            <p>As an experienced millwright, I understand the challenges you may be facing in your plant. While I may not be able to fully comprehend your specific situation, you have already received valuable advice to help you improve. It's important to recognize that there is no "magic wand" solution for achieving reliability - it requires patience and commitment. I was fortunate to have management support and key personnel, but it still took six months to see the beginning of a return on investment. While additional man hours would be beneficial, it seems like budget constraints may prevent this.

Based on your description of quick changeovers with the right parts, have you considered implementing tool boards or kitted boxes to streamline your processes? This approach could potentially help you save time and resources without significant cost. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a step in the right direction. Stay positive and keep persevering - we are here to support you on your journey to improvement. Good luck!</p>

            <p>As an experienced Millwright, it is time to develop your Roadmap for Change. Design a visually appealing roadmap of your Master Plan and display it prominently for all stakeholders to see (this can be updated as needed). Amidst the chaos and downtime, your team will benefit from a simple reminder to stay focused on the overarching goals. It is crucial to also communicate this to key decision-makers, such as Senior Managers, to demonstrate the value of your work consistently. Your objective is to raise the importance of maintenance to the Board Room level. Eventually, you will be able to secure funding from supporters who believe in your vision. Encouraging influential employees on the shop floor to align with your goals can be a valuable asset. Emphasizing the importance of effective planning is essential, as many individuals claim to plan without truly understanding the process. By implementing these strategies, you can achieve success in your endeavors. Best regards.</p>

            <p>Greetings Old Millwright! I have been in a similar situation at a Just In Time Automotive manufacturing plant, and while it may seem challenging, there is a solution. This presents a great opportunity for you to shine as a standout member of the management team. Here are some key steps to get you started:

1. Address the issue of a 30% job changeover rate. Whether it's 30% of equipment experiencing daily job changes or causing downtime, this is a chance to focus on maintenance tasks. Collaborate with the production set up team to handle essential maintenance tasks like adjustments, cleaning, and lubrication. This can enhance productivity and reduce conflicts between maintenance and production teams.

2. Attend daily production meetings to understand operational challenges firsthand. By implementing proactive maintenance during downtime for job changes, you can measure improvements in machine effectiveness and overall productivity. Maintain a focus on lubrication, maintenance, and identifying potential issues to streamline the production process.

3. Lead your team with a positive attitude and avoid complaining about management or production team decisions. Your role is to ensure efficient production through preventive maintenance and improved uptime. Collaboration with the production planning team can maximize scheduled downtime for maintenance, showcasing your team's value to the company's success.

By following these steps and fostering positive relationships with key stakeholders, you can drive significant improvements in efficiency and results in a short timeframe. Remember, your efforts and leadership play a crucial role in the company's success. Best of luck on your journey!Roger Harris CPMM CMRP, Senior Business Consultant at Total Resource Management.

            <p>Hello there, fellow Millwright! We were once in your shoes until we decided to invest in a top-notch CMMS software called "MP2". Since starting in June 2003, we began with the essentials and gradually incorporated more equipment. Following that, we implemented a comprehensive preventive maintenance (PM) program covering tooling, parts, electrical systems, and general maintenance. It is crucial to procure a CMMS program for your operations, and you might consider hiring a data entry specialist to input all necessary information. Our team comprises of various roles including tooling specialists, parts technicians, EMTs, maintenance coordinators, and more, working together to accomplish tasks efficiently. Attending operational meetings is vital for collaboration. Begin by establishing a basic PM schedule using a CMMS program. Stay connected, and feel free to reach out for any assistance. Best of luck on your journey! - PM Enthusiast</p>

            <p>At Old Millright, the key to driving your team successfully lies in three essential elements, with the third being the most crucial. This website is a valuable resource for establishing a culture of reliability in your plant. The three key components include a strategic approach, a cohesive team, and most importantly, a strong belief that success is achievable. Warm regards, [Your Name]</p>

            <p>Having been in a similar situation before, I understand the challenges you are facing. Some of the posts here are informative, while others may not be as engaging. Feel free to print out this post and share it with your higher-ups. It is crucial to assess and document your current situation, but it seems like your plant is in critical condition and requires urgent attention. The level of maintenance and firefighting activities you are currently undertaking is likely hindering your production targets. It is time to give your plant a break and make a strategic investment to turn things around. Identify the most pressing issues in your plant and allocate resources to address them promptly. This process may seem straightforward but can be quite complex in practice. Management support is essential for this initiative, which may involve paying for overtime or hiring additional staff/contractors. Your maintenance team also needs to shift their focus towards problem-solving and long-term planning. Rather than just putting out fires, they should be proactive in addressing maintenance issues. Our facility has a dedicated maintenance team working on downtime maintenance during off-days to address all weekly issues. Once you have dealt with major issues, you can shift your focus to minor ones. A Maintenance Manager once advised me to have a mechanic work on idle equipment, even if it's just polishing it, to maintain its condition. While this may seem excessive, the logic behind it is sound. Giving your maintenance team more time to work on equipment leads to better overall equipment performance. It is crucial to hold a brainstorming session with all stakeholders to identify and solve problems. The ultimate goal is to establish a comprehensive preventative maintenance program, which can only be achieved when your maintenance staff is not constantly putting out fires. Implementing regular inspections and maintenance routines during normal production hours is key to ensuring the long-term sustainability of your plant and equipment. Striving for a "TRUE" preventative maintenance program - Test, Reliability, Understanding, and Effectiveness - should be the end goal for your maintenance efforts.</p>
