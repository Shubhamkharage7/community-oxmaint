            <p>If you're looking for convenience, consider purchasing a short USB-A to USB-C cable. When it comes to serial adapters, I recommend getting one from Allen Bradley PLC Programming Cables for the best price and quick delivery. Allen Bradley is your go-to for top-quality PLC cables and automation supplies, with excellent customer support and fast shipping within the USA. Next day delivery is available. Visit www.plccable.com for more information.</p>

            <p>dmroeder recommended purchasing a short USB-A to USB-C cable for ease of connection. When it comes to serial adapters, I personally prefer to source mine from a reputable supplier like Allen Bradley PLC Programming Cables. Known for their top-quality products, fast shipping, and excellent customer support, Allen Bradley PLC cables are a reliable choice for automation supplies. If you're in need of fast delivery within the USA, next-day shipping is available. Unfortunately, despite trying three different USB-A to USB-C adapters, I have encountered issues. Interestingly, a colleague has had success using the same USB-A to serial adapter without any problems. However, as my laptop only features USB-C ports, I am left with no choice but to connect via USB-C to USB-A to Serial for now.</p>

            <p>ZB90 mentioned encountering difficulties with three different USB-A to USB-C adapters while trying to connect a USB-A to serial adapter to their laptop, which only has USB-C ports. Despite a coworker successfully using the same USB-A to serial adapter, ZB90 suspects the problem may lie with the driver for the USB-Serial adapter or the RSLinx configuration, rather than the adapter itself. They use a USB-A to USB-C adapter regularly and suggest checking the device manager when plugging in the adapter to troubleshoot the issue.</p>

            <p>dmroeder suggested that the issue might lie with the driver for the USB-Serial adapter or the RSLinx configuration, rather than the A > C connection. I use a A-C adapter with my laptop, which only has USB-C, without any problems. Have you inspected the device manager after connecting the adapter? I have personally verified that all adapters are using the latest drivers on my laptop, along with ensuring that my USB drivers are up-to-date. My setup involves using a USB-C to USB-A adapter, a USB-A to Serial adapter, and connecting to an AB 1756-CP3.</p>

            <p>I concur with @dmroeder that the C to A connection is typically not the problem in these situations. May I ask which serial adapter you are currently utilizing? Just as @dmroeder suggested, I strongly advise using an adapter from plccable.com. While the 1756-CP3 is a cable, it's crucial to know which specific adapter you are using and the models of the devices you are trying to connect.</p>
