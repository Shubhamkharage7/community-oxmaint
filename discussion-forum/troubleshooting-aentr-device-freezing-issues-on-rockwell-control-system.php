                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Recently, our Rockwell control system was upgraded from ControlNet to Ethernet using the 1719-AENTR module. However, we have encountered issues with two AENTR devices freezing up in the past few months. Despite trying to reconfigure the PLC and clicking the display, there was no response, requiring us to power cycle the devices to resolve the issue. 

We are now exploring the possibility that upgrading the firmware may correct the problem and prevent it from recurring in the future. Additionally, we are investigating other potential causes for the device malfunctions. Is there a way to prevent this issue from happening again after the firmware update? What other troubleshooting steps should be taken to address these freezing incidents?</p>

            <p>I have successfully installed around 80 to 100 of the 1719 devices. The only hiccup I've encountered is duplicate IP addresses. Despite that, they have all performed exceptionally well for us. Could it be possible that there was a duplicate address accidentally set up?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>JeffKiper mentioned that he has successfully set up around 80 to 100 of the 1719 devices without any major issues, except for occasional problems with duplicate IP addresses. He questioned whether IP duplication could be the issue. However, the user clarified that there are no duplicated IP addresses in the installation site, even with over 30 devices previously installed and 30 new ones this year. The issues only seem to occur with the recently installed 1719 AENTR devices, which have experienced IP duplication twice in the past 4 months. The user is puzzled by this as they believe such issues should occur more frequently if IP duplication was the root cause. Corrections are welcome if any inaccuracies exist.</p>

            <p>To optimize network performance, it is important to ensure that your connections are set to Auto-Negotiate. If they are set to half-duplex while trying to communicate full-duplex, this can lead to communication errors and dropped packets. To troubleshoot, check the communication page of the processors accessing the AENTRs for any flagged errors. In a similar situation with an older L35E, there were numerous packet collisions and dropped packets occurring. It is crucial to address these issues to maintain smooth communication and data transfer.</p>
