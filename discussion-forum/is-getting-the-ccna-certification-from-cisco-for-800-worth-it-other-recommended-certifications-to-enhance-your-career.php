            <p>In the early 2000s, I came to the realization that non-accredited certificates are essentially worthless, serving as nothing more than a stack of meaningless paper. Despite accumulating over 100 certificates in various fields, employers and potential employers showed no interest in them. Since then, I have disposed of numerous certificates that held no value in advancing my career opportunities. It is important to note that these certificates were not obtained from accredited colleges or universities.</p>

            <p>I recently had a conversation with a friend who has a background in information technology (IT) and has been actively seeking employment for over a year. Despite his intelligence and on-the-job training experience, he has been facing challenges in securing job interviews due to lack of certifications. After working at the same company for 25 years, he was laid off, depleting his 401k savings. Now, he is facing financial difficulties.</p>

            <p>Aabeck lamented the realization that certificates were ultimately deemed useless and nothing more than a pile of discarded paper. Despite earning over 100 certificates, employers showed no interest in the fields of expertise they represented or the quantity acquired. However, the value of certificates may vary depending on the industry. While they may hold little significance in some sectors, the IT industry tends to place more importance on them.</p>

            <p>Many IT professionals are hindering their own progress by refusing to collaborate with Operational Technology (OT) teams. Despite multiple attempts to integrate machines onto a separate network for OT management, IT departments struggle to prioritize VPN setup for plant floor applications. The reality is, while the plant floor can function without IT support, the reverse is not true. Manufacturing has historically thrived independently of IT, highlighting the importance of bridging the gap between these two essential components.</p>

            <p>One drawback of the CCNA certification is the need for recertification every 3 years. Despite holding a degree in IT, I did not pursue any CCNA exams during my education. The certificates obtained from my college did not hold much value during job interviews, where experience and job-specific scenarios were more important. However, many job postings do list CCNA as a requirement. It is important to note that Cisco has long been considered the industry standard in networking, but new companies are providing competitive hardware solutions at lower prices. In my current role, I am gradually transitioning from Cisco to Ubiquiti gear, finding it to be a more favorable option.</p>

            <p>In the realm of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the significance of certificates is usually overlooked, with the exception being safety standards adherence. While the knowledge required to ace the test holds merit, the certification itself may hold little importance to a control systems firm.</p>

            <p>mk42 mentioned that in the world of PLCs, certificates are typically not highly valued, unless they are related to safety standards. While the knowledge required to pass certification tests is valuable, the actual certification may not hold much weight with control system companies. However, the value of certifications like ISA CAP can vary depending on the employer, with potential for a significant salary increase.</p>

            <p>In the realm of PLCs, certificates are typically not highly sought after, except in certain cases where they are tied to safety standards. The knowledge needed to pass certification tests holds value, but the certification itself may not hold much weight in the eyes of control houses. However, there is an exception to this rule when it comes to onsite GM work in our area - now, Macomb Community College's GCCS-2 certification is required. This requirement is especially prevalent in body and assembly, although I have not encountered it in Powertrain work recently.</p>

            <p>jstolaruk mentioned a new requirement in our neighborhood for GM onsite workers - the need for a GCCS-2 certification from Macomb Community College. While this stipulation seems to apply to body and assembly work, I have not encountered it in Powertrain yet. It has been a while since I last visited a GM plant, but I find it interesting to learn about these new mandates. I have had some experience in a Chrysler plant through a contractor, and it felt like I was somewhat under the radar. It makes me wonder if Chrysler was aware of my presence and if there were specific requirements I should have followed. In such situations, it would have been beneficial to have at least gone through a safety orientation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Is it worth getting a CCNA certification for $800? The answer is subjective, as there are plenty of affordable or even free resources available online on platforms like YouTube and Udemy. In my experience, studying for the CCNA has greatly strengthened my understanding of networking. While I have yet to take the exam, I do plan on obtaining the certification. However, I may not prioritize renewing it every three years. In my industry, where ownership rights are constantly contested, having a CCNA certification can provide credibility during negotiations. It is important to note that the value of certifications can vary depending on the industry. Additionally, holding a certification does not guarantee intelligence.</p>

            <p>Maxkling mentioned that the significance of the ISA CAP certification varies depending on the employer. In some companies, having this certification can potentially result in an additional $10,000 in salary. This is the first instance where I've seen a company recognize and reward this certification. While I initially considered pursuing it for personal fulfillment rather than financial gain, it's encouraging to know that individuals are being compensated for their efforts.</p>

This certification can pave the way for a transition into the IT or Networking field. On the other hand, if you are interested in industrial automation, self-study by investing in relevant books may be a more beneficial approach.</p>
