            <p>In my opinion, written procedures are often verbose, outdated, and primarily used for protection. Despite this, regulators and auditors value them, while workers tend to overlook them. However, procedures are necessary, though they don't always have to be in legal jargon. I propose using process flow charts to communicate procedures to workers, easily accessible on-site rather than buried in manuals. These charts should feature visuals like photographs or 3D sketches to illustrate each step, alongside dimensional guidelines in tables. The more user-friendly the charts appear, the more effective they will be. Although some standard terms are necessary, simplicity is key to ensure that people actually read and adhere to them. This approach will improve comprehension and compliance.</p>

            <p>Are you in need of examples of process flow charts for ISO9000 compliance? While some consultants refer to them as business process maps in the context of writing ISO9000 procedures, there has been debate over whether these maps provide enough detail. In the realm of ISO9000 documentation, there are three levels to consider: Manuals, Procedures, and Instructions. However, the question remains: are process flow charts appropriate for maintenance instructions, such as lube oil sampling?</p>

            <p>I completely agree with Vee. In my industry, which is heavily regulated, regulators place a strong emphasis on visual aids such as process flow charts, exploded diagrams, and photos. Including these visuals as appendices can greatly enhance the understanding of procedures.</p>

            <p>Even in a highly regulated industry like Airlines, there are still levels of oversight that may not compare to other sectors. During a recent visit to a GE engine repair workshop and a BA Avionics repair facility, I observed extensive use of process charts to aid workers, along with well-worn manuals filled with sketches. Both facilities hold ISO 9000, CAA, FAA, and other accreditations, undergoing frequent audits and recertifications. It's clear that the level of regulation in aviation is unmatched. You'll need to look elsewhere to find a different explanation!</p>

            <p>With ample experience in the aviation and pharmaceutical industries, it is evident that the two sectors differ greatly in terms of regulations. Pharmaceutical companies operate under stringent guidelines, unlike overhaul shops in aviation. Transitioning from developing procedures for aircraft systems to those affecting human health was a significant adjustment due to the complex regulatory environment of the medical field. The mindset of both regulators and the regulated is distinct when comparing aviation and pharmaceuticals. Quality assurance in an engine overhaul facility occurs in a test cell, whereas in pharmaceutical manufacturing, it takes place in patients. A minor flaw in a process could lead to a shutdown in a pharmaceutical plant until the issue is rectified, validated, and approved by the FDA – a process that could take several months.

            <p>Hello Ken, prior to entering the pharmaceutical industry, my background was in electronic manufacturing where regulatory issues centered around OSHA and EPA due to handling mercury in thermostats. This experience left me unprepared to address Vee. It is beneficial to include visual aids such as process flowcharts, diagrams, and photos in procedures as appendices or placed between paragraphs, similar to textbooks, to facilitate comprehension. Despite the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words", pharmaceutical SOPs tend to be text-heavy, at least until the FDA decides to make changes.</p>

            <p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (BPV) code previously employed a higher safety factor compared to the German AD Merblatter/TRD/EN codes. However, adjustments were made to align it with international standards and promote competitiveness. Additionally, modifications were made during wartime to conserve materials. Any proposed revisions to the ASME code will undergo evaluation by a committee through the Code Case process. This ensures that safety standards are maintained and any changes are carefully assessed for implementation.</p>

            <p>Ken, Darth, thank you for your insightful comments. I believe that procedures are crucial for two main reasons. Firstly, they serve as a safeguard against legal action, especially in industries with strict regulations. Secondly, they are essential for guiding employees in performing their tasks accurately. While these purposes may align at times, they often diverge. The decision between using textual instructions or flowcharts depends on your specific goals. However, a combination of both methods is typically utilized, with varying emphasis. In my opinion, flowcharts can be just as effective as text, if not more so, in terms of clarity, validation, and quality assurance. Unfortunately, in today's litigious society, legal protection typically takes precedence. This reality may be unfortunate, but it is simply a part of the business landscape.</p>

            <p>Josh mentioned that the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code implemented a higher safety factor based on Ultimate Tensile Strength. In contrast, European standards, starting with the old British Standard (BS1515), shifted towards using Yield Strength as the design basis. This shift was driven by a greater understanding of the failure process, resulting in thinner and lighter equipment. The UK led the way in transitioning from prescriptive regulations to goal-setting regulations, allowing companies more flexibility in achieving safety targets. This change was prompted by the Piper Alpha disaster, prompting the UK to prioritize goals over strict regulations.</p>
