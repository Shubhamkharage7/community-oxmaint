                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, we are currently dealing with issues on a 2-stage reciprocating compressor. The suction pressure at the first stage is 700 Kpa, while the discharge pressure at the second stage is 7000 Kpa. When the compressor trips, it unloads and rapidly depressurizes from 7000 kpa to 1500 kpa in just 70 seconds. This rapid depressurization has led to numerous failures in the orings at the second stage discharge, specifically in the valve caps and gas release areas. Despite trying ED resistance orings, the issues persist. The compressors in question are from the Cooper Cameron (superior) brand. I am currently looking into the possibility that increasing the depressurizing time could potentially resolve the issue. It is crucial that the settle out pressure is lower than the first stage maximum operating pressure to prevent damage to the compressor. If anyone has experience with similar situations, please share your insights. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Dear Brighton, I find the issue at hand to be quite intriguing. Can you please provide some additional clarification on the following points to help me better understand the problem statement:

1. How long has the compressor been operational?
2. What is causing the compressor to trip instead of unload?
3. Can you provide details on the unload and loading pressures?
4. Does the compressor have an air-cooled or water-cooled intercooler and aftercooler?
5. How long has the problem of gasket/o-ring failure been occurring in the compressor system?
6. Were the intercooler and aftercooler installed in the OEM factory or on-site?
7. If the compressor is located indoors, what is the room temperature during compressor operations?
8. What are the compressed air temperature readings at the inlet and outlet of the aftercooler assembly?

Best regards,
Md Rumman</p>

            <p>Welcome back, Brighton! Md R raises a great question about compressor tripping. When compressing methane or other light gases, O rings may expand over time due to the materials used. This can cause them to become too large in size. Before seeking opinions on the material for ED, please share more data.</p>

            <p>Hello Vee and MR, I apologize for the delay. Below are the answers to your questions:

1- The compressor has been in operation for almost a year, with a downtime of 2 months due to orings failure.
2- The compressor has trip set points for LL/HH suction pressure, HH suction temperature, HH discharge pressure, etc. If any of these setpoints are reached, the compressor trips and depressures rapidly through a 2x1" PV in 75 seconds from 7 MPa to 1.5 MPa.
3- I will need to follow up with additional information.
4- There is an air-cooled fin fan cooler at the interstage and aftercooler.
5- Initial issues with orings were due to using viton material, which was later changed to FR25/90 and then Elasto line 101. The problem occurs at the second stage discharge where the highest temperature and pressure are present.
6- The coolers are located outside the compressor skids and were installed on-site.
7- The compressors are housed in enclosures with internal ventilation.
8- Adjusting the temperature set point of the intercooler from 70°C to 50°C lowered the 2nd stage outlet temperature from 165°C to 145°C. The process gas consists of natural gas with 19% mol CO2.

Since the second oring failure, the 2nd stage discharge pressure was increased from 6900 to 7600 KPa, and the discharge temperature was reduced from 165°C to 145°C. The blowdown time was also extended from 75 to 180 seconds to minimize stop/start cycles. The permeation of gas into the orings at high pressures is the main issue, suggesting the need to increase the blowdown time further. The compressor receives supply gas from the Condensate stabilizer overhead and operates with only 2 stages. If more information is required, please let me know. What other steps should be taken to protect the orings?</p>

            <p>In Brighton, it is common knowledge that high pressure can cause methane to decompress suddenly, affecting O rings. This phenomenon can also be observed in pig launcher/receiver manway gaskets. Before consulting O ring manufacturers, it is recommended to first reach out to the OEM. There are specific materials suitable for this type of service, although their names may not be readily remembered. An effective method we discovered over 25 years ago is massaging oversized gaskets and allowing them to dry for 2-4 days to restore their original size. Additionally, consider reducing blowdown rates to prevent this issue. It is important to ensure that any alterations to set points are within the design envelope or follow proper change control procedures.</p>

            <p>I have a couple of questions for you: 1) Which frame/model of compressor do you recommend, such as the Superior SW? 2) What type of unloading scheme do you suggest – Fixed Clearance Pockets, Variable Clearance Pockets, Head end unloaders, or something else, and in what specific order? Based on the pressures you provided, it appears that the compression ratio per stage is approximately 3.3. In this case, the 1st Stage may be able to handle all the work, but adjusting the unloading set points could possibly improve efficiency. Have you considered using kalrez o-rings (by DuPont) for this service? As mentioned earlier, it is advisable to contact Cameron for expert recommendations.</p>

            <p>Yes, the changes made have stayed within the allowed limits and underwent a management of change process. I agree with your concern about sudden depressurization. I am currently exploring ways to extend the depressurization time. Regarding your questions, Joel, I need to do some research and will get back to you with the answers. The compressors we use are top-of-the-line models from Cooper Cameron. Unfortunately, we have not been receiving satisfactory support from the supplier in Singapore, which is quite disappointing. Vee and Joel, could you please guide me to a website where I can learn more about loading, unloading, and other principles related to reciprocating compressors? Thank you.</p>
