                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Our single stage Centrifugal pump features a double mechanical seal back to back arrangement, with Seal Plan 53A and pressurized red oil. Recently, we encountered a mechanical seal leak issue which led to the pump getting jammed and unable to rotate freely after re-pressurizing with red oil. Upon releasing the pressure, the pump resumed free movement. Despite checking for axial movement when pressurized and finding none, the problem persisted upon re-pressurization. The seal vendor was consulted and seal assembly was redone in their presence, yet the jamming issue persisted. We welcome any suggestions or insights on resolving this recurring problem.</p>

            <p>Are you monitoring your barrier fluid pressure to prevent issues? It's important to maintain the correct pressure to ensure proper face contact and loading. If you are using a cartridge type seal, be wary of excessively high seal face contact pressure that could lead to increased friction and pump jamming. Running the pump in such conditions can quickly wear out the seal face and even cause the hard face to break, leading to leaks. What did you discover with the old leaky seal? Make sure to address any issues to prevent further damage. Check out Vibmaster for more insights.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The pressure of the barrier fluid is maintained at 5.0 kg/cm2g in the seal pot, which is controlled by nitrogen. The mechanical seal in question is not a cartridge type, but rather a manually assembled back to back design. Face loading is adjusted by compressing the rotating component of the seal to specific dimensions outlined in the seal drawing. It is worth noting that this mechanical seal recently failed for the first time in the pump's 13-14 year history, with no previous maintenance records available. While there were no visible damages on the seal faces, the back plate holding the stationary component was found cracked, leading to fluid leakage. Your guidance and advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Experiment with adjusting the hydrostatic pressure by slowly decreasing the nitrogen purge pressure while hand-rotating the pump. If the jamming eases as the pressure is reduced, it indicates that the issue is related to the 5 bar pressure. This pressure forces the rotating face against the stationary face, preventing manual rotation. It is advisable to rotate the pump manually before starting it to avoid excessive wear on the seal faces. If the seal pot level remains stable when the pump is off, the seal is suitable for use. If a slight reduction in hydrostatic pressure is needed before starting the pump, it is recommended to do so. The pressure can always be increased if the pot level rises. If the seal holds up well at the reduced pressure, you can continue operating with it.</p>

            <p>Could it be possible that we overlooked a crucial step? Have you attempted to manually open the suction valve and rotate the pump while under a 5-bar hydrostatic pressure? This could potentially resolve the issue at hand.</p>

            <p>The 5 bar pressure mentioned should be balanced against a suction pressure to prevent jamming of seal faces. Without a proper suction fluid, 5 bar may be too high and cause the pump to not rotate. Consider designing for an optimal intake suction pressure before attempting to rotate the pump for smooth operation.</p>

            <p>After replacing the back plate/gland plate, it's important to ensure the dimensions of the new plate, especially its thickness, are checked. A thinner plate may result in increased loading for the same operating length of the rotating face/holder. Determine if the seal is a single spring or multi spring type and note the initial and operating length of the rotating face holder. Adjusting the operating length can be challenging for non-cartridge seals. Be sure to check for any deviations in the diameter of O-rings between the gland plates and stuffing box. Additionally, don't forget to inspect the barrier fluid gas pressure indicator. Take note of these details to ensure optimal performance.</p>

            <p>I am not familiar with the specifics of your mechanical seal, but I have some insights to share. If you are experiencing excessive compression between the rotating and stationary parts, it may be helpful to use Y sticks or spacers provided by most seal manufacturers. These tools can help maintain the correct compression levels. For seals like the John Crane Type 21, compression is determined by the spring between the seals and the dimensions of the pump components. Properly adjusting these factors is crucial for the optimal functioning of your mechanical seal.</p>

            <p>Issues with starting can sometimes occur in API Plan 53 A and Plan 53 B due to high starting torque. This is caused by maintaining barrier fluid pressure around 1 kg/cm2 above the maximum stuffing box pressure. If the motor is operating at nearly full capacity, starting problems may arise. A recommended solution is to switch to API Plan 53 C, where the stuffing box pressure is consistently maintained at the actual pressure plus approximately 1 kg/cm2. With Plan 53 C, the barrier fluid pressure will be lower during startup, effectively resolving the starting issue.</p>
