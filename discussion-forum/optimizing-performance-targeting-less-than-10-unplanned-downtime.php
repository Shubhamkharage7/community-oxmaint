                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Achieving world-class performance is our ultimate goal, aiming for less than 10% unplanned downtime. With three main production lines, we have seen improvements from our previous figures of 8%, 13%, and 9% in 2015. Taking into account the necessary 12-16 hours of planned downtime each week for maintenance, we ensure that any delays or issues are accurately accounted for as unplanned downtime. Our detailed trending of production parameters enables us to closely monitor and calculate unplanned downtime with precision. What should be our target for optimal performance?</p>

            <p>Upon receiving the latest AMP newsletter in my inbox, I noticed the subject line was "[AMP] How Do You Accurately Track Down Time?" and included a discussion on the topic. Initially, I intended to respond with our proprietary "True Downtime Cost" (TDC) methodology, which can be found at http://downtimecentral.com/tdc.shtml. To my surprise, upon further exploration, I discovered that the focus was not on the "how-to" aspect but rather on defining what constitutes a world-class percentage. In my opinion, the ultimate aim should always be continuous improvement, regardless of varying perspectives on what defines today's benchmark for "world-class" performance.</p>
