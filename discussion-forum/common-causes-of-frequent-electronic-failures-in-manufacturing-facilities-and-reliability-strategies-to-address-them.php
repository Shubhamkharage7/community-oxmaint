            <p>Fabian, can you provide more details about the type of failure you are experiencing? Are there any specific components affected, such as the electronic card or PLC outputs? I always make sure to keep up with the latest information on the Spanish board as well. Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Electrical and electronic boards often experience random failures, making them difficult to predict. While thermal scanning can be helpful, it may not pinpoint the specific component that will fail. Consider incorporating thermography and ultrasonic monitoring into your maintenance routine to detect potential failures. It could be beneficial to establish a board repair team within your maintenance function. While these measures can reduce the likelihood of failures, complete elimination is not guaranteed. Best regards, Rolly Angeles.</p>

            <p>Hello Cristian, Rolly, and cheddarcaveman, failures like this one often occur in electronic cards and PLC outputs. The most recent incident happened yesterday when a card failed to start up. Even after replacing it with a spare from the store, the issue persisted. Eventually, after re-installing the original card, it began functioning after a delay. This unexpected failure caused a 40-minute halt in production. The exact cause of the issue is still unknown. Best regards, Fabian.</p>

            <p>It appears that the issue may be due to overheating. Try placing the old card back in the slot and see if it starts working again after a few minutes. Make sure to check the temperature of the area where the card is located and consider swapping out the local power supply if necessary. Best of luck with troubleshooting!</p>
