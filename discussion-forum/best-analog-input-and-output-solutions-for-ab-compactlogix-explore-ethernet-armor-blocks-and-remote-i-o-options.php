            <p>In a recent forum post, user johnd_125 shared their positive experience with an Automation Direct thermocouple module connected to a CompactLogix PLC. They mentioned that the module has been working flawlessly for a few months, and expressed optimism that other analog modules from the same company would perform just as well. However, it appears that there may be a delay in availability until late April. The product in question, a modbus TCP-enabled module, can be found at the link: https://www.automationdirect.com/ad..._i-z-o/stride_i-z-o/analog_i-z-o/sio-mb08thms. It was also noted that similar analog modules are available, although with a later availability date in June. The original post also raised the question of whether the module is compatible with the ethernet port on the CompactLogix PLC.</p>

            <p>Davinjw commented that the devices appear to be high-quality and also available in regular analog versions (until June). The one in the provided link is specified as utilizing Modbus TCP. Are you implementing this with the Ethernet connection on the CompactLogix PLC? Yes, I am connecting it via Ethernet, necessitating the use of a "Modbus TCP Client" Add-On Instruction (AOI) in the CompactLogix. This instruction is named "raC_Opr_NetModbusTCPClient," as shown in the attached image.</p>

            <p>Alfredo Quintero agrees, expressing that the shift in consumer behavior is expected to occur in mid-2023. When there is even a slight reprieve, individuals tend to switch to new products or services, putting pressure on existing offerings. This consumer tendency towards change is common in the market and can impact businesses significantly.</p>

            <p>In a recent conversation, johnd_125 shared their experience using a "Modbus TCP Client" AOI in the CompactLogix for Ethernet communication. The specific instruction name is "raC_Opr_NetModbusTCPClient," as shown in the attached image. They successfully tested a few analog output modules, which proved to be accurate and cost-effective. Utilizing a Fluke process meter, they noted precise readings. For those looking to integrate analog output modules with the mentioned AOI, it is advised to initially configure for reading registers before switching to writing mode. This approach ensures accuracy by allowing for unique analog values to be set and verified via the web interface before finalizing the write process.</p>

As a newcomer to programming and with limited experience in message instructions and MODBUS protocols, the transition from a prosoft module to onboard MODBUS on the 5069 PLC range has posed challenges. While the communication setup with refrigeration units used to work seamlessly, integrating the new AOI has proven to be a bit of a struggle.

Understanding the Source & Destination TAGs, as well as the read & write messages within the AOI, has been particularly tricky. Despite being able to retrieve data through polling, persistent "sts_Overload" and "sts_Overlap" faults require attention.

As a quick fix, a watchdog timer has been implemented to reset the enable bit for a brief period when faults occur. However, it's essential to pinpoint the root cause of these issues for a more sustainable solution. Any insights or suggestions on resolving these problems would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Joe, to troubleshoot the issue, begin by deactivating all transactions and then activating them one by one to pinpoint the source of the "sts_Overload" and "sts_Overlap" faults. These errors typically suggest that the modbus address range is incorrect, such as attempting to poll a range beyond what the device supports. For example, if you are trying to access addresses 4xxx1-4xx100 but the device only allows 4xxx1-4xx50, you may encounter these faults. Good luck in resolving the issue!</p>
