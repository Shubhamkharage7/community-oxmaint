                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As a novice in PLC programming, I apologize if my questions may not be advanced. I am currently using a CompactLogix L32E PLC connected to a PanelView, distributed I/Os, PowerFlex, and my PC via an ethernet switch. Initially, all components had preconfigured IP addresses and were functioning smoothly until I unintentionally activated a pre-downloaded instruction within the PLC. Consequently, I am unable to locate my PLC on the network. The problematic instruction I activated was a MSG with the following configurations: 

Message Type: CIP Generic
Service Code: 10
Class: f5
Instance: 1
Attribute: 5
Source Element: IP_address[0]
Source Length: 22

The Source element array used includes the integers 11-88-640-1-1-1, with the remaining array filled with "0". I am unsure of the exact impact of this instruction and how to restore communication between the PLC and other devices. The previous address of the PLC was 10.0.2.170. 

Any insights on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>This mechanism used is quite advanced! The message has successfully set the IP address of the CompactLogix to the default address of 192.168.1.1, along with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. To revert the CompactLogix back to its original settings, you can either connect a PC with a similar IP address within the 192.168.1.x subnet or connect to the serial port of the CompactLogix. In RSLinx, simply navigate to the CompactLogix Ethernet interface module, right-click, and choose "Configure Module" to adjust the IP address accordingly.</p>

            <p>Greetings xGlory7! It's great to have you join the PLCTalk forum community. This particular thread dates back to September 2010, and a lot has changed in the world of Rockwell automation in the 13+ years since then. Rockwell has introduced new platforms such as the 5380 and 5580, which come with more advanced TCP/IP capabilities like selectable DLR ring versus independent configuration.

The original query posed was about recovering from an MSG instruction that had overridden the IP address. The solution provided was to connect with RSLinx Classic and utilize the Device Configuration feature to reset the IP address to the desired setting.

If you have any other specific questions regarding configuring IP addresses on Rockwell controllers programmatically, feel free to navigate back to the main Q&A section and kickstart a new discussion by clicking on the shiny orange New Thread button. Let's delve deeper into your unique equipment and inquiries.</p>
