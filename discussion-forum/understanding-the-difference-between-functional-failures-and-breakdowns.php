                    <p>Hello everyone, Let's consider a scenario where an asset is designed to produce 10 kg/hr of a specific product. If the asset's production capacity drops below 10 kg/hr, according to the definition of a function, this would be considered a functional failure. However, would this also be classified as a breakdown? Your input on this matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you. Best regards.</p>

            <p>In the realm of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), the concept of breakdowns is not commonly used. The driving force behind maintenance decisions in RCM is the potential impact on safety or production. Performance standards are set, such as a target of 10 kg/hr, and failure to meet this standard is the key measure of failure. Unlike traditional maintenance approaches, RCM defines a performance band rather than a single level, allowing for a range of acceptable performance. While some level of performance reduction is tolerated, it should not go beyond the predetermined acceptance standard. In traditional maintenance, breakdowns are seen as a complete loss of function, while RCM allows for certain breakdowns that do not significantly impact operations, such as duty pumps with backup equipment. It is important to address these issues before they escalate, even if the equipment is still operational. For those interested in learning more about RCM, AsiaEdge Singapore is hosting a 5-day workshop in Kuala Lumpur this month. For more information, please contact Easwaran@asiaedge.net.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. What is the difference between functional failures and breakdowns in asset management?
- Functional failures refer to a deviation from the intended function of an asset, such as a drop in production capacity below the specified level. Breakdowns, on the other hand, typically involve a complete cessation of the asset's function.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Would a drop in production capacity below the specified level be considered a breakdown?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - No, a drop in production capacity below the specified level would generally be classified as a functional failure rather than a breakdown. Breakdowns usually involve a complete failure of the asset to perform its intended function.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How are functional failures and breakdowns relevant to asset performance and maintenance?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Understanding the difference between functional failures and breakdowns is crucial for effective asset management. By distinguishing between the two, maintenance strategies can be tailored to address specific issues and prevent costly downtime.</p>
