                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Having an Aveva Edge project that occasionally crashes during the process of generating an .rtf file report and sending it to a printer is a common issue. Despite the app and reporting functions usually working smoothly, there are instances where an error message appears, stating "The Viewer module could not connect to the Run-Time." This typically indicates a compatibility issue with the runtime or a connection error.

This problem occurs within a local project, with the runtime running on the development PC. To resolve this issue, try closing the viewer and rebooting the PC. The file is saved in a local folder within the project directory, and the printer is connected via an ethernet on a local network.

To troubleshoot this problem, enable all dump logging features within Aveva Edge and review the generated .txt and .csv files for any potential issues. It is essential to examine these files thoroughly to identify any underlying issues causing the intermittent crashes. If you are unsure of what to look for, seeking advice from experienced individuals or forums may provide valuable insights.</p>

            <p>It seems like you may have made an interesting observation. After reviewing a few dump files, I noticed a rise in occurrences related to thin clients. This struck me as unusual considering that this application is intended for local use only, with no thin clients involved. I will conduct further testing to see if addressing this issue can improve the situation. Thank you for bringing this to my attention!</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After implementing the suggested change, the app continues to experience occasional crashes. Upon reviewing the latest .dmp dump file, an access violation exception was identified as the cause of the issue, which was attributed to heap corruption. I have submitted a support ticket to Aveva in hopes of resolving this matter promptly.</p>
