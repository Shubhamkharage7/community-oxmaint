                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Exploring the Reasons Behind Industry's Reactive Nature

The industry tends to be reactive in nature, responding to failures as they occur. Even with effective Preventive Maintenance strategies and advanced software in place, it is impossible to capture all failures. Failures can be categorized into three patterns: Infant Mortality, Random Failures, and Wear or age-related failures. Understanding these failure patterns is crucial in developing a comprehensive maintenance structure that can effectively address a majority of failures. 

Preventive Maintenance focuses on age-related component failures and infant mortality failures, which only account for around 20% of equipment failures. In industries with automated equipment and electronic components like semiconductors, the most common failures are random in nature, making them harder to predict and prevent. This highlights the limitations of Preventive Maintenance in capturing random failures, prompting the need for alternative strategies like predictive maintenance, run to fail, or modification. 

To address the various types of failures effectively, a well-rounded maintenance strategy should be implemented, capturing wear out, age-related, random, and infant mortality failures. Developing a structured maintenance approach is key to managing equipment failures proactively.</p>

            <p>Nice to connect with you here, Rolly. I fully agree with your insights and would like to share some additional thoughts. 

1. It is crucial for our actions to align with the needs of the business in order to satisfy society, generate revenue, and maintain operations efficiently. This can be achieved through focusing on Technical Integrity, Availability, and Asset Life, all of which are influenced by Reliability. 

2. The timing of most failures can be unpredictable, and traditional methods like statistical analysis may not always provide accurate predictions. However, strategies like Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) or Predictive Maintenance (PdM) can help anticipate failures by monitoring measurable indicators. This proactive approach involves predicting the time of failure once signs of impending failure are detected. 

3. Some failures may not have significant consequences and can be managed through a run-to-failure or breakdown strategy. In such cases, a reactive approach is a prudent business decision. 

4. Research shows that less than 20% of failures are related to the age of equipment. Therefore, age-based preventive maintenance may not be effective in all cases. It is important to assess each failure mode individually and determine the most suitable approach, whether proactive or reactive. 

In conclusion, both proactive and reactive strategies have their merits and should be applied thoughtfully based on the specific situation. Just as we don't conduct regular organ replacements based solely on age, maintenance strategies should be tailored to address hidden failures effectively. Each scenario must be evaluated on its own terms to determine the most appropriate course of action.</p>

            <p>Josh emphasizes the importance of being proactive and overcoming hurdles. He believes in designing out failures when it makes good business sense. However, his earlier note was not about this concept. Following Rolly's thesis, he discusses the misconception that preventive maintenance is always good and breakdowns are always bad. While this may be true in some cases, it is not always the best approach. When breakdowns have minimal consequences, it may not be necessary to do preventive maintenance or eliminate the failure. It is crucial to prioritize risk reduction over blindly following proactive approaches.</p>

            <p>Josh, there is a consensus on the importance of this forum and all reliability forums highlighting that it is more efficient to focus on repairs rather than constantly analyzing failures. As my colleague Bob Nelms wisely advises, sometimes taking a slower approach can actually expedite the process. Across various industries like manufacturing, mining, shipping, airlines, power plants, and automotive, a reactive mindset seems to be ingrained in the maintenance and operations culture. My argument, supported by Vee, emphasizes the significance of acknowledging the ramifications of failures over solely striving to prevent them. Many maintenance managers prioritize efficiency in repairs over investing time in analyzing failures. I would like to retract my previous statement about being at a disadvantage, as there is still hope for industries to comprehend why they lean towards being reactive and strive to enhance their strategies for addressing failures.</p>

            <p>I fully support the concept of Root Cause Analysis (RCA), but implementing it for equipment failures can be challenging, especially in cases like pump mechanical seal leaks. How can we streamline the RCA process for equipment failures, considering the numerous variables that need to be identified and addressed? In my opinion, conducting RCA for work process breakdowns is more straightforward compared to failure analyses, which may require Root Cause Failure Analysis (RCFA). Seeking assistance from consultants experienced in RCFA or engaging in laboratory examination by a knowledgeable metallurgist might be necessary to successfully complete an RCFA. What are your thoughts on this issue?</p>

            <p>Josh, stated that identifying and analyzing equipment failures, including understanding the metallurgy or chemistry, is a crucial aspect of root cause analysis (RCA). However, the challenging part lies in uncovering human and latent failures, whether it's related to mechanical seal failures, business processes, or accident investigations. For instance, in the case of the Piper Alpha disaster, detailed work and testing were required to comprehend the sequence of physical failures, similar to metallurgical analysis of mechanical seals. Contrary to popular belief, understanding why certain decisions were made, such as refusing to shut down the platform after the first explosion or implementing local start controls instead of central controls, proves to be more challenging. Additionally, overlooking critical issues like the poor condition of safety equipment, as seen in the inadequate sprinkler nozzles and deluge system prior to the disaster, raises questions about the effectiveness of inspections.

Returning to the issue of submersible pump failures, conducting a thorough RCA on-site is essential to prevent future incidents. Unfortunately, there is no update on whether the problem was resolved or not. However, seeking assistance from a knowledgeable RCFA facilitator/trainer, such as Rolly12, could lead to a successful resolution. It's evident that a well-executed RCA can make a significant difference in addressing and preventing failures effectively.</p>

            <p>Do you have a copy of the Piper Alpha report? There are numerous factors to examine when determining the causes of physical damage. Possible causes for mech seal leaks include cooling water interruptions, pump misuse with a closed drain valve, motor overload, journal bearing malfunctions, excessive play in thrust bearings, and more. How can we pinpoint the initial point of failure in such cases?</p>

            <p>Josh mentioned that he doesn't have a copy of the Piper Alpha report and suggested checking the company library or purchasing it from the UK Dept of Energy. There is also a brief description of the report in his book. He emphasized the importance of considering various factors that could lead to physical damage, such as mech seal leaks. Some suggested causes include cooling water cut off, pump operating against a closed drain valve, motor overload, journal bearing failure, and thrust bearing excessive play. It's essential to determine which part failed first in each case through systematic analysis. This is where Root Cause Analysis (RCA) comes in, finding evidence to support or refute theories of causal links. While you can draw on others' knowledge and experience for theories, you still need to gather and analyze evidence yourself. Understanding the physical chain of events is crucial in this process.</p>

            <p>Josh asked, "What are the common causes of a mechanical seal leak?" Some physical chain of events include: 1. Incorrect original fitting leading to improper seal pressure. 2. Misalignment of motor-pump set resulting in excessive vibration and shaft orbiting. 3. Inadequate seal flush with incorrect pressure or flow of flush fluid. 4. Frequent starts causing start-up wear. 5. Low NPSH leading to vapor lock, chattering, and impact damage. 6. Incorrect seal design such as materials, pressure balancing, and type of seal. 7. Inadequate seal cooling due to coolant temperature or quantity issues. 8. Axially misaligned steam quench port causing face separation. 9. Damaged bearings causing misalignment and vibration. Each of these issues can be further explored to uncover additional root causes.</p>

            <p>Josh, you inquired about instances of physical failure chains of events, which I have endeavored to provide examples for. It seems that there are various scenarios to consider. When seeking a generic set, it is common to come across many that may not be relevant to your specific circumstances. It is important to carefully examine each case based on its individual merits and to understand the unique aspects of your local situation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Using Condition-Based Monitoring equipment can help detect potential failures caused by random failures. There are three options for addressing random failures: running to fail if the consequences are minimal, implementing Predictive Maintenance for potential failures, and making modifications if failure consequences are unacceptable. Trying to catch random failures is like trying to capture lightning with a Polaroid camera. Preventive Maintenance is less effective for random failures, and adding more activities to it won't necessarily solve the problem. Increasing Preventive Maintenance activities may even increase the chances of Infant Mortality failure. It's important to remember that more Preventive Maintenance does not always mean fewer problems.</p>

            <p>The importance of condition-based maintenance lies in its ability to conduct non-intrusive testing on equipment, thus preventing maintenance-related failures that can arise from traditional preventive maintenance methods. While not all condition-based maintenance approaches are non-intrusive, random failures are not necessarily undetectable. In fact, there are often signs and indicators leading up to such failures. By selecting the right condition-based maintenance strategy, businesses can minimize the risks associated with unexpected equipment breakdowns. Howard</p>

            <p>Attached is a document discussing the distinction between "reactive" unexpected failures and "corrective" failures that are identified and repaired either after a predictive or detective task, or when warning signs of a problem are detected. The article also references the RCM Scorecard featured in the author's book. This information may be valuable to you. Download the attachment named "Letter-Captured_by_Data.pdf" to learn more.</p>

            <p>The physical aspect of root cause analysis (RCA) involving metallurgy or chemistry is often considered the easier part, compared to identifying human and latent failures. Whether dealing with mechanical seal failures, business process issues, or accident investigations, organizations tend to initially focus on resolving physical problems. However, uncovering human and latent failures proves to be more challenging. Many organizations lack a comprehensive process for conducting RCA effectively, as revealed by our surveys. Recognizing this need, we are hosting a conference and learning event dedicated to improving root cause analysis practices. For more information, visit http://www.reliability-magazine.com/</p>

            <p>The importance of human value addition is often a topic of debate. While some individuals believe that being reactive is more beneficial than being proactive, others argue the opposite. One example of this is when people work overtime to earn extra income.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are the three main categories of failures that the industry faces?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The three main categories of failures are Infant Mortality, Random Failures, and Wear or age-related failures.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Why is it challenging for Preventive Maintenance to capture all types of failures?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Preventive Maintenance mainly focuses on age-related component failures and infant mortality failures, which account for only around 20% of equipment failures. It struggles to predict and prevent random failures, which are common in industries with automated equipment and electronic components.</p>
