            <p>Welcome to the forum! Are you looking for the best 1756 ControlLogix HART Analog I/O Modules available? You will need a Logix rack with power supply and EtherNet/IP bridge to fully utilize these modules. If you prefer using HART IP instead of EtherNet/IP, there are cost-effective HART IP device/HART masters gateways as an alternative to the Logix solution. Keep in mind that there may be fewer HART IP clients available compared to EtherNet/IP. Developing a HART IP client using tools like CODESYS and the FieldCom Gr HART IP client sample can be challenging, whereas integration with EtherNet/IP is generally easier. For more information, refer to the following link: https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/1756-um533_-en-p.pdf</p>

            <p>Alfredo, I apologize if my previous message was unclear. I am currently searching for an Ethernet to HART gateway that is external to my ControlLogix chassis. I am interested in learning more about the various brands and models available, such as SST, Phoenix Contact, ProSoft, and IFM. Can you provide recommendations or insights on which ones are considered decent in terms of performance and reliability? Thank you.</p>

            <p>While I haven't had the chance to experience HART technology, I am confident in the quality of ProSoft products based on my positive experiences with their hardware. Should the opportunity arise and my budget allow, I wouldn't hesitate to invest in their solutions. I have found ProSoft's hardware to be reliable and their customer support to be valuable. While Phoenix Contact and IFM are reputable brands overall, I have yet to try their "smart" offerings.</p>

            <p>Hello RetiQlum2, I apologize for the lack of follow-up earlier. Have you found a suitable product yet? There is a reputable California-based company specializing in HART and HART IP technology. The gateway featured below includes four HART master channels and one RJ45 port, functioning as a HART IP server on the Ethernet side and HART master on the four channels. The challenge lies in the scarcity of HART IP clients available in the market.

Our company has created a tailored HART IP client using Codesys for monitoring HART valves. However, this application does not support DD and requires manual coding of HART commands specific to your application's needs, making it a complex task. Alternatively, you can invest in Emerson Process AMS software, which provides comprehensive solutions, albeit at a significant cost per Windows workstation.

Explore our HART SMART Dual Speed (9600/1200 BPS) I/O Gateway for a reliable HART devices solution. Upgrade your HART Modem experience with our advanced technology.</p>
