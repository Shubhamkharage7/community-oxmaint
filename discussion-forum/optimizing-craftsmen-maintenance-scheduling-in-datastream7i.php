                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am interested in learning about the methods others use to schedule maintenance work for craftsmen on a daily basis. Our current process involves creating weekly schedules with numerous PM/PdM/planned work orders for groups of craftsmen ranging from 10 to 20 individuals in size from 7i. We aim to fully maximize the workload for each craftsman based on their skills and availability. Despite using a complex excel worksheet with macros, we face challenges in transferring data back to 7i. MSProject proves to be cumbersome for managing hundreds of small jobs ranging from 30 minutes to 4 hours each. I am wondering if there are any tools or techniques within 7i or any other software that can help streamline this essential task.</p>

            <p>Some common questions asked in plant management: 1) What kind of plant is it? 2) How many craftsmen are employed? 3) What are the benefits of using MS Project for daily operations? 4) Is there a centralized planning department? In our industry, we utilize MS Project primarily for specialized projects such as shutdowns, turnarounds, and complex jobs requiring coordination among multiple crafts. We find it unnecessary to include routine tasks like "greasing motor bearings" in MS Project. Instead, we rely on magnetic plan boards displayed on our walls to outline equipment and PM events for the entire year. Additionally, each registered piece of equipment is assigned to a Maintenance Responsibility Center (MRC), with departments like mechanical maintenance, electrical/instrumentation, and rotating equipment specified within the system. Each MRC is led by a team leader responsible for workload distribution, assigning work orders, and monitoring progress. It is crucial for the planner to focus on resource allocation based on craft and available time, freeing up the team leader to oversee day-to-day operations effectively.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response! Here is some additional information about our company: 1) We specialize in discrete processing of food products. 2) We have a team of 130 skilled craftsmen. 3) While we do not currently use MS Project for maintenance scheduling (only for large project management), Datastream once recommended using 7i for integration purposes. 4) We have four planners who are responsible for assigning tasks to groups of craftsmen and maintenance supervisors based on plant areas. 5) Our maintenance supervisors ensure that work is assigned and completed by craftsmen.

One of our main challenges is effectively managing the daily workload of individual craftsmen. We aim to schedule eight hours of work for each craftsman, including setups, changeovers, PMs, and planned tasks. This results in scheduling thousands of work orders monthly by our supervising team. Due to the dynamic nature of plant operations, there is a constant need to adjust schedules, leading us to seek a tool to streamline this process.

Our current tool enables us to create a weekly schedule and assign daily tasks to craftsmen. It tracks hours assigned per craftsman per day, considering work schedules. While the tool provides valuable metrics like WO completion rates and job loading, it lacks seamless integration with Datastream7i, causing duplication of work such as completing work orders.</p>

            <p>Quote: Although 7i has the capability to integrate and was once recommended by Datastream for this purpose, we have since moved away from using it. MS Project is ideal for detailed time planning to ensure that incompatible activities do not overlap. When scheduling work for craftsmen, we aim for eight hours, but the industry average is typically only 2 hours out of 8. Higher productivity levels are usually seen during high-stress periods with increased supervision. While it is a useful tool, it does not sync back with Datastream7i where the data should be stored. Why not utilize the tool to extract and report the data if it's all in Datastream? Exporting to Excel and creating graphs is the simplest way to analyze performance and make improvements in your business. Is there a conflict between the "computer/office clan" and the "grease monkeys" causing resistance to utilizing technology for data analysis?</p>

            <p>To provide a clearer example, let's consider a scenario where there are 400 work orders scheduled for the week, involving tasks such as equipment setup, changeovers, PMs, and planned work. It is essential to adjust these work orders, target dates, and assigned craftsmen daily, based on production schedules and priorities. These decisions are typically made collaboratively between the maintenance team and production supervisors. Additionally, it is crucial to monitor the workload of each craftsman. As tasks are completed each day, remaining work orders on the schedule are reviewed for assignment. In cases where there is a shortage of jobs on the schedule, tasks are pulled from a larger backlog known as 'ready to schedule.' Managing work order target dates and assignments while monitoring scheduled versus available hours can be challenging when handling a significant volume of work orders daily.

Our goal is to store this data in Datastream for the purpose of analyzing metrics such as schedule completion rates, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), estimates versus actuals, and more. While our current system involves using Datastream7i forms and considering an upgrade to the extended version for other functionalities, feedback on the extended work order scheduler (featuring drag-and-drop to calendar) has been mixed. We are particularly interested in learning about efficient strategies employed by Datastream7i users for managing a high volume of small tasks ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours.</p>

            <p>When managing a team of craftsmen, it is crucial to consider how each individual is assigned their tasks. Are you in charge of planning or overseeing the work? I believe the planner should determine the type of craftsman needed for the job, while the supervisor selects the specific individual. If you are constantly tasked with scheduling 400 jobs each week as a planner, it can be challenging to truly understand how the work is being carried out. How can you confidently choose the best person for the job without having a deep understanding of each craftsman's abilities and qualities? It takes a seasoned supervisor with knowledge of all craftsmen, their skills, and personalities to make informed decisions.</p>

            <p>I am based in our corporate office, where I focus on implementing best practices to improve reliability throughout our company. My query is not related to the duties of our planners and maintenance supervisors. Planners primarily organize work and create weekly schedules that include automatically generated preventive maintenance tasks and planned work selected from our backlogs based on priority and equipment availability. Maintenance supervisors are tasked with assigning craftsmen to work orders daily and overseeing their execution. I am seeking a tool to assist maintenance supervisors in assigning craftsmen to numerous work orders daily, managing their availability, job loading, work completion, and more. While we have a useful tool outside of our current system, it lacks two-way information flow, resulting in the need to complete work orders in multiple systems. I would prefer to handle all scheduling within our current system, but I have found it to be challenging. I am interested in learning how others manage daily and weekly scheduling efficiently.</p>

            <p>For a while now, we have been utilizing 7i for our scheduling needs. Our goal is to plan further ahead than just one day. Although we have fewer craftsmen, our craft group lead technicians create a comprehensive schedule for each technician in 7i. By using the scheduling screen in 7i, you can visually assess the manpower distribution by trade and craft. Another option is scheduling from the SCHEDULE LABOR tab in the work order and then checking the distribution in 7i. While this method is not perfect, we are eager to connect with others who are also utilizing 7i for scheduling purposes.</p>

            <p>Tyler, I have created a tool within an Oracle database that is tailored to your needs. While many CMMS systems prioritize work orders over the tradesmen, my tool allows you to easily manage and assign work orders to each individual based on their availability and capacity for each day. In addition to assigning work orders, the tool also provides insight into the number of hours each person has been assigned and even allows for the printing of work lists. If you are interested in seeing this tool in action, please reach out to me at 919-341-2733 or email me at rlinzel@gmail.com.</p>
