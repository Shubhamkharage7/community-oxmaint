                    <p>Looking for help setting up an Intouch app as an OPC UA Server in the Wonderware System Management Console (SMC)? I need assistance with configuring Wonderware SMC to send tags over OPC UA to Cimplicity IGS Server. The first step is establishing the OPC UA Server in Wonderware SMC, followed by setting up the IGS Server as an OPC Client to receive the tags. The challenge lies in understanding the "Syntax" utilized in Cimplicity IGS.</p>

            <p>Is the IGS Server able to function as a UA client? It has been confirmed that the SMC can act as a UA server, but my knowledge of Cimplicity IGS Server is limited. Therefore, I am curious if IGS is similar to KEPware, such as GE IGS Server being a rebranded version.</p>

            <p>User harryting raised a question about the capabilities of the IGS Server to act as a UA client. While it is known that the SMC can serve as a UA server, there is uncertainty regarding the capabilities of the Cimplicity IGS Server. Is the IGS Server similar to a rebranded KEPware, like the GE IGS Server? It's worth noting that the IGS Server does support OPC UA Client functionality, as outlined in this datasheet from GE Digital: https://www.ge.com/digital/sites/default/files/download_assets/industrial-gateway-server-from-ge-digital-datasheet.pdf. It's important to approach questions with an open mind and avoid dismissive responses.</p>

            <p>It seems that Harryting may have intended to suggest that his own question was not very smart, rather than the original poster's question. However, it is crucial to include a key qualifier like, "This might sound like a foolish question, but..." when discussing such matters. Proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization are extremely important in communication. This is evident in the stark contrast between assisting your Uncle Jack with dismounting a horse, and assisting your Uncle in a completely different and inappropriate act with a horse.</p>

            <p>If you follow this link and navigate to the "IGS Basic" protocol list on the third page, you will discover that it is capable of functioning as an OPC UA client. I have also received help files from Cimplicity, but they are difficult to understand. This is why I am seeking guidance from someone who has successfully configured IGS as an OPC UA Client. I believe I have configured the Wonderware SMC side correctly, but I would like to confirm this with someone who has experience in this area. My main challenge lies in understanding the syntax or pathway from IGS to SMC, as they are interconnected servers over Ethernet. I am considering reaching out to Cimplicity support to inquire if they have any staff with knowledge of Wonderware, and vice versa by contacting Wonderware support.</p>

            <p>Saffa pointed out that Harryting may have intended to suggest that his own question was silly, rather than the original poster's. However, it seems like he forgot to include a crucial qualifier, such as "This may be a silly question, but can...". Proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization play a significant role. For instance, there is a substantial difference between assisting your Uncle Jack in dismounting a horse and assisting your uncle in pleasuring a horse. It is essential to pay attention to these details. It's possible that there was a misunderstanding, and I should have considered reading between the lines. I perceived the comment as overly critical, even though I didn't believe my initial post was unintelligent.</p>

            <p>In order to connect to the UA Server, the first step is to obtain the URL/endpoint and insert it into the UA Client driver. If Wonderware utilizes port 4840 as the local discovery server port, this should be designated as the browsing port for endpoints. Once the endpoint is acquired in the channel properties, you can set up a device within the UA client channel, known as a UA subscription. By successfully establishing a connection to the endpoint, you can seamlessly import items from the UA Server without having to worry about syntax errors. As long as Wonderware adheres to the UA Spec and remains compliant, the UA Client Driver should have no issues interfacing with it.</p>

            <p>In a discussion, Saffa pointed out that Harryting may have intended to label his own question as silly, rather than the original poster's. However, a crucial "but" seemed to be missing in his statement. Proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization play a significant role in conveying the intended message accurately. As a humorous example, the distinction between assisting your Uncle Jack in dismounting a horse and assisting your Uncle in a different activity is highlighted. The importance of proofreading is emphasized, especially as it may prevent misunderstandings like these. English being a second language for Saffa, occasional oversights due to laziness can occur.</p>

            <p>It is worth noting that GE IGS was previously known as Kepware. However, upon reviewing the spec sheet, it appears that there may have been changes as there is no mention of a DNP driver, even in the premium section. Additionally, the ability to "link" tags, a feature reminiscent of Kepware's "Advanced Tag," is not present. Without this linking capability (unless it was overlooked), the purpose of the UA client is unclear. Despite these observations, the screenshots in the spec sheet still resemble Kepware to me.</p>

            <p>Fred_Loveless mentioned the importance of obtaining the URL/endpoint of the UA Server to input into the UA Client driver. If Wonderware utilizes port 4840 (the local discovery server port), that port should be specified for browsing endpoints. Once the endpoint is retrieved in the channel properties, a device can be configured within the UA client channel. This device acts as a UA subscription. Connecting to the endpoint allows for importing items from the UA Server without worrying about syntax errors. As long as Wonderware adheres to the UA Spec and is compliant, the UA Client Driver should function smoothly.

I will explore this route further and verify Wonderware's UA compliance. Setting up tags in Wonderware is straightforward, with a direct link to the tagname database for selecting desired tags to serve out. These tags are automatically included in the "Item List" in the OPC Server operated under the FSGateway. In comparison, configuring Cimplicity appears more complex, especially since I have no prior experience with its IGS Server. The only GE software I am familiar with is Machine Edition, utilized for configuring PLC Logic and Quick Panels.</p>

            <p>NetNathan expressed interest in exploring a specific route and mentioned considering Wonderware as they are likely UA compliant. Wonderware proved to be user-friendly for setting up tags, providing a seamless link to the tagname database. The process involves selecting desired tags to be added to the "Item List" in the OPC Server under FSGateway. On the other hand, Cimplicity appears to be more complex, especially for those unfamiliar with its IGS Server. The only GE software product utilized is Machine Edition for PLC Logic and Quick Panels configuration.

For those facing a similar situation, like Nathan did previously, in navigating the outputting of HMI tags via an OPC UA server, any shared insights or experiences would be greatly valued.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the company decided to abandon the project, thus preventing me from completing it. To establish communication with PLC and Quickpanel, one can utilize the GESRTP IO server provided by Wonderware. Depending on the version of GE Machine Edition software at your disposal, configuring a Quick Panel should be feasible. A convenient aspect of this setup is that if you already have a Machine Edition project with the PLC, you can simply add the Quickpanel as an additional target within the project, allowing you to conveniently control both devices in tandem.</p>
