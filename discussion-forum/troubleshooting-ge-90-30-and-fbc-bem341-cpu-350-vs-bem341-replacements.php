                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently facing challenges with the GE 90-30 and FBC BEM341 FIP bus controller. My objective is to replace either the CPU 350 or BEM341. I have a copy of CC90 for uploading and downloading, but it seems there is an issue with the association. Is there anyone who has access to suitable GE software tools that could help with this situation?

According to the guidelines, the FIP Bus Controller release requires the Hand–Held Programmer (HHP), windows programming software IC641CTLxxx Release 2.0 or later, or the FBCLOAD configuration utility for proper network operation. While we have an HHP and memory card, the memory card is unfortunately not supported by the CPU 350.</p>

            <p>Facing this challenge is certainly going to be a test of your skills. Throughout my ten years working for a distributor of GE PLCs, I never encountered a customer requesting a quote for a PLC with a FIP bus. Adding to the complexity, it seems that Control90 was the only software that supported hardware configuration for the FIP bus controller, and it was a short-lived offering. However, the VersaPro software that followed didn't include the FIP controller in its hardware catalog. In addition to these obstacles, the handheld programmer is unable to configure systems with CPUs higher than CPU340.

What exactly is the issue at hand? Has the PLC's memory been lost? Is your version of CC90 outdated for compatibility with the BEM341? Can the ladder logic from the CPU350 (with 120K memory) be transferred to a CPU331 (8K memory), CPU340 (16K memory), or CPU341 (40K memory)? All of these CPU models are compatible with the handheld.

It's important to note that the ladder logic program and the hardware configuration are stored separately in the PLC's memory. With CC90, it may be possible to extract the program from the CPU350, but not the hardware configuration. If you have a CPU331 available, you could potentially use the HHP to configure the system with that module. Afterwards, you can connect to the PLC using Proficy Machine Edition to extract the hardware configuration. Utilizing Proficy, import the CC90 ladder logic, switch the CPU model back to a CPU350, and attempt to send that to the CPU350.</p>

            <p>While rifling through a collection of old CDs, I stumbled upon one labeled Cimplicity Control (CC90) version 2.10 Service Pack 3 from November 1998. Interestingly, the README document on the CD does not mention compatibility with either the BEM340 or BEM341 FIP bus controllers. According to the GFK-1213 manual section on configuration using a handheld device, it seems that the module must be physically installed in the rack for configuration. Surprisingly, this manual does not provide any information on configuring using CC90 software.

On the other hand, the GFK-1295D manual dated 1998 states, "This manual and the online help have been updated to showcase the new features introduced in Version 2.10 Service Pack 3," and it includes detailed instructions on configuring the FIP bus controller. The CD containing this software is relatively small, around 35 Megabytes. If interested, feel free to send me a message, and we can work out a way to share a copy with you. Please note that it will be an unlicensed copy, but it will operate for a 4-day demo period without any restrictions. Embracing outdated technology has always been my forte.</p>

            <p>I'm in need of the software that can configure the IC693BEM340 module as I am facing some issues with it. I am able to upload from the IC693CPU350 CPU using Proficy Machine Edition v6.0, but unfortunately, the IC693BEM340 hardware is not included.
