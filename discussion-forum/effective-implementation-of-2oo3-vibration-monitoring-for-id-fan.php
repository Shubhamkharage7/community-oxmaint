                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello members, I am currently working on a waste incinerator Unit with a flue gas flow rate of 400,000 Nm3/hr and am facing an issue with monitoring the ID fan. We are considering implementing a 2oo3 voting system for vibration monitoring. Currently, we only have sensors on both X and Y bearings, resulting in a 1oo2 trip when a certain threshold is reached. However, I believe a 2oo3 setup may not be feasible as vibrations detected on the X axis may not always correlate with those on the Y axis. One potential solution could be to install three sensors on both X and Y axes, but this could be expensive. Do you have any recommendations for implementing a 2oo3 vibration trip effectively? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your comment regarding the Rolling element bearing. When I refer to "2oo3", I mean a 2 out of 3 detection system. This means that we require at least two high levels to trigger the fan to trip. Therefore, if only one sensor surpasses the trip threshold, no action will be taken. While it is simple to install for temperature monitoring, implementing a 2oo3 system for vibration detection may pose some challenges. High vibration along the vertical axis may not necessarily translate to high vibration on the horizontal axis, potentially causing a failure to trip the system.</p>

            <p>What are the benefits of transitioning from a "1 out of 2" to a "2 out of 3" plan? Making the switch to a "2 out of 3" plan offers greater feasibility and success compared to the previous plan. By carefully analyzing our goals, we can determine if the investment and risks are justified. What is driving this change and what are the potential advantages?

            <p>When it comes to applying logic to bearings, it is important to use the 1oo2 method on a single bearing rather than on multiple bearings. With 1oo2 logic, if either the X or Y probe surpasses the trip value, the machine will trip. It is not recommended to use a logic that involves both probes on both bearings crossing the trip value simultaneously. Therefore, there is no 2oo3 logic implication since there are only 2 probes on a single bearing. It is impractical to install 3 X probes and 3 Y probes on one bearing. How could you even fit 3 X probes on a single bearing? - Nagesh</p>

            <p>The original post seems to discuss an online monitoring and protection system installed on the fan's bearings, with four sensors in total. The post does not mention the driver. In terms of logic, various combinations for triggering a trip are possible, involving different bearings or signal types. The ease of implementation depends on the installed protection system and ESD. When considering the best logic for triggering a trip (1oo2, 2oo2, 1oo3, 2oo3, 1oo4, or 2oo4), it may be necessary to evaluate the overall cost and impact from maintenance and operations perspectives. Introducing a time delay as an alternative to changing the voting logic could be a viable option to address faulty signals. Have you explored this possibility? - Regards, Ali M. Al-Shurafa</p>

            <p>We appreciate everyone's assistance. Ali M., your insight is correct. The fan now features two bearings, each equipped with 2 sensors on the X and Y axes. The new plant strategy prioritizes increased "availability" to prevent unnecessary shutdowns. This is why the group is considering making changes solely for improved availability. Currently, a high vibration reading on one sensor may trigger a shutdown based on 1oo2 detection, potentially leading to a false alarm. Implementing a voting system with three temperature measurements is straightforward, but addressing vibration issues, especially across different axes, poses a challenge. For instance, having high vibration on one axis while sensors are primarily placed on another axis may not trigger an alarm with a 2oo3 logic system. Monitoring vibration and bearing health is crucial, but over-instrumentation with high maintenance requirements for minimal results is not the ideal approach. As Nagesh mentioned, installing 3 sensors on both X and Y axes is impractical. Thank you once again for your valuable input and time.</p>

            <p>In your situation, 1oo3 indicates the use of 3 sensors on the drive end bearing and 3 sensors on the non-drive end. It's possible that each bearing will be equipped with sensors measuring in x, y, and z directions. Best regards, Ali M. Al-Shurafa.</p>
