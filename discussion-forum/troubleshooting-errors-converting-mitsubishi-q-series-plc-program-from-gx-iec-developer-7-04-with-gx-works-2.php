                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently working on a Mitsubishi Q series PLC that was programmed using Mistubishi's GX IEC Developer v7.04. Despite searching online, I have been unable to locate a copy of GX IEC Developer. I have turned to using GX Works 2 to convert the file since IEC developer is no longer supported. However, I have encountered various errors during the compilation of the converted file, prompting me to continue my search for the old IEC developer software. Any guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>It is important to have the source file available for code conversion in GXDeveloper. Without it, the code may convert to ladder format, which can cause issues. The GXIEC system was designed to be compatible with older systems and display graphical representations, using temporary memories as placeholders. 

If the original source file is not available, complications may arise during the conversion process. For instance, errors may occur if function blocks have the same name for parameters as symbolic variables. While there is an option in the compiler settings to allow the use of the same symbolic name, it is recommended to rename either the symbol or the function block variables.

Originally developed by a contractor for Mitsubishi, GXIEC is no longer available and I have it stored on an old PC without the original CD. It is advisable to upload the memory "Main" from the PLC to prevent data loss due to battery issues.</p>

            <p>Parky mentioned the importance of having the source file for code conversion. If the source file is not available, the code will likely be converted to ladder format in GXDeveloper. There may be issues if the original source file is missing, as GXIEC was specifically designed to make older systems compatible and display graphical representations of the code using temporary placeholders like M9000 and D9000. Converting the code can also be challenging if the user created function blocks with the same names for parameters and symbolic variables. It is recommended to check the compiler settings for options to handle this issue. GXIEC, originally created by a Mitsubishi contractor, appears to no longer be available. Uploading the memory "Main" from the PLC is advised to prevent loss of data due to battery failure. Thank you, Parky, for sharing this insightful information.</p>

            <p>When converting files from one programming software to another, issues may arise if the initial programmer used custom libraries that are inaccessible. In such cases, exporting the libraries in GXIEC and then importing them into GXWorks is necessary. If working with IEC version 7.xx, attempting the conversion and obtaining a PDF printout is possible, but factors like password protection may impact the process.</p>

            <p>Parky mentioned that there may be issues with the conversion process if the original programmer used their own libraries and protected them. In such cases, these libraries will not be automatically integrated into the new GX Works project and would need to be exported from GXIEC and re-imported into GX Works. If the files are password protected, conversion may also be affected. The client provided me with a code copy, but I can only see a file with a ".PRO" extension when attempting to convert it in GX Works 2 using the "Other File Option". As mentioned by Parky, the error messages relating to the libraries not being converted are indeed appearing. I will review the code again and make necessary adjustments. Thank you for your guidance, Parky!</p>

            <p>In order to export the libraries, you will likely require GXIEC. This tool displays the code in a visually informative way, where functions from the libraries are depicted as a box with a cross inside. However, there are peculiarities to be aware of when attempting to convert projects. If a project is password-protected in a "view only" mode, a password will be prompted for editing access. On the other hand, if the entire project is protected, it cannot be converted. Imported libraries will appear as read-only, though there may be ways to open them through some experimentation. It's important to have the necessary files, with softctrl.pro being the key file that GXWorks uses for project conversion in the project directory.</p>

            <p>The image attached in your response aligns with what I have observed, except for a TEMP file present in my version. I have included the image for better clarification. Attempting to access the project via the "Open Other Projects" feature in GX Works 2 only results in the .PRO file being opened, with a missing registry and compilation errors as mentioned earlier. Is it possible that an IEC developer needs to export libraries specifically after conversion? Would switching to GX Works 3 be more beneficial than using GX Works 2? I have tried the trial version of GX Works 3 but couldn't locate an option to open an IEC Developer file, unlike GX Works 2. Therefore, I value your opinion on this matter. Thank you for your input.</p>

            <p>GXWorks3 is the go-to software for the latest hardware, offering compatibility with GXWorks2 for those who still need it. When creating a new project with a Q plc, it will launch GXWorks2 to allow for the conversion of a GXIEC project. However, importing user libs from files created in GXDev may not be possible without the use of IEC for exporting the libs.

If permitted by your client, I can provide my email address through a personal message for file sharing. After zipping the file, I can open it with GXIEC and either send a PDF printout or convert it to GXWorks2. Keep in mind that when making modifications online, compiling and fully downloading the code is necessary as the compiler may re-map temporary variables.

To ensure a smooth process, consider creating a GXWorks project with a ladder only, which essentially functions as a compatible version of GXDeveloper. By uploading the "MAIN" memory and PLC parameters, you will have a comprehensive copy of the data. Additionally, remember to configure special cards separately using utility programs for features like Ethernet and analogues.</p>
