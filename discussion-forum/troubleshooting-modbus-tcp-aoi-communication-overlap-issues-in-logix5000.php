                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hey everyone, I've been struggling to establish communication between Modbus TCP and Rockwell's Modbus TCP AOI for reading purposes. I've encountered some issues and was hoping to get some assistance. It appears that when I attempt to request data from holding registers (a total of 34), only about ten registers are successfully read. At times, I receive an STS_Overload alarm, while other times there is no alarm, but the transaction status always shows as "exception". I have gone through the documentation thoroughly and have experimented with the execution period of the Periodic Task and the Poll Interval of the AOI, but the issue persists. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>If your ACD upload is showing a faulted state and you need assistance with wireshark analysis, referring to the Modbus Slave device manual can provide valuable insight. Overlap issues may indicate that your peer device failed to respond in time for the next scheduled read attempt. By checking the exception code, you can pinpoint the specific issue at hand. It is possible that you are trying to read data that is not supported by the device.</p>

            <p>If you are unable to share your complete automated call distribution (ACD) settings, you can still export and upload just one specific ladder logic rung from your alarm output indicator (AOI). By doing so, you will be able to preserve all of the important configuration and exception values within that particular rung.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  What could be causing the issue of only a portion of the holding registers being successfully read when using Modbus TCP AOI for communication?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The issue of only about ten registers being successfully read while attempting to request data from 34 holding registers could be related to communication overlap issues or configuration settings. It's important to review the setup and configuration of the communication parameters to ensure proper data exchange.</p>
