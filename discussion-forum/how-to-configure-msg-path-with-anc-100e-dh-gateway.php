                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently acquired an ANC-100e DH+ gateway to facilitate remote work via a Cell modem. While I have successfully programmed the PLC5 at the remote location, I am struggling to configure a MSG path from a CLX using this device. How do I specify the node address after inputting the IP address? I have a similar Prosoft device that simply requires adding a comma followed by the node address after the IP address. Unfortunately, I have been unable to locate any documentation pertaining to this particular functionality of the ANC-100e. I have contacted their customer support, but they are not available for another hour. If anyone here has the solution to this issue, I would greatly appreciate your input.</p>

            <p>I do not have personal experience with the ANC-100e, so the information I provide below may not be entirely accurate. Have you configured the "Routing Table" links for the DHRIO in RSLinx? Your MSG communication should specifically reference the DHRIO path - for example, 01, 1756-DHRIO/C, ANC-100e. Additionally, ensure you select the Communication Method as DH+ and enter the Source & Destination Link number (0-199) that you set in the "Routing Table" link for the DHRIO CH A. The Destination Node should correspond to the Octal address of the PLC. I hope this clarification is beneficial for you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I have primarily utilized these for remote programming so far and they seamlessly integrate with RSLinx for that purpose. However, I was taken aback by the complexity of messaging through them. My mistake! The DHRIO is a virtual component housed within this device. While there is an IP to DH+ node mapping within the device, the specific IP used doesn't appear to affect as long as it is on the same subnet. It appears to be exclusively utilized within the device itself. The correct entries for Source Link and Destination Link remain unclear at this time.</p>

            <p>It could be beneficial to attempt configuring virtual modules in Linx by right-clicking on 01, 1756-DHRIO/C, ANC-100e, and selecting module configuration. This may provide access to a "Routing Table" for channel link assignment.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The ANC-100e is designed to accurately replicate a 1756-ENET and 1756-DHRIO within a compact 4-slot chassis. This allows for seamless integration into your program, treating them just like real -ENET and -DHRIO modules. The focus is on the DHRIO slot as the MSG target, with specific entries for Channel number, destination DH+ node ID, and remote/local and bridge link ID's. Once the message is executed on DH+, the DHRIO will receive a reply and send the payload back over the CIP path. If your DH+ appears local, you can keep the link ID settings at default zeroes. However, it's important to consider this if you plan on utilizing a 1785-KE module in the future.</p>

            <p>After following a suggestion in the Help file, I was able to successfully configure my DH/RIO module. By specifying zero for the source link and destination link, I eliminated the need for the FTLinx Gateway when setting up a single DH+ link. The configuration utilizes the RSLinx Gateway driver with just the IP address inputted. However, I am still unsure about how the MSG entries are physically organized on the RSLinx Tree. This routing via MSG is a new concept for me as I have never configured anything through racks or bridges before.</p>

            <p>After following a suggestion in the Help file, I finally found a configuration that worked for my DH+ link. If you're only using one DH+ link and not using FTLinx Gateway for remote links, input zero for both the source and destination links. I used the RSLinx Gateway driver with just the IP address, but I'm still confused by the dialog. I wish I had a better understanding of how these MSG entries are organized on the RSLinx Tree. This routing method was new to me as I hadn't previously worked with racks or bridges. The configuration worked flawlessly from a 5069-L306ER to a 5/04, just remember to specify which Ethernet port (A or B).</p>
