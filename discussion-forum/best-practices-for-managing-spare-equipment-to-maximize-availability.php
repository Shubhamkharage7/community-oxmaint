            <p>When it comes to operating spare equipment, there is no one-size-fits-all rule. Different types of machinery and processes can impact the failure rate of equipment in various ways. It is important to consider the specific requirements of each site in order to determine the best approach. This also involves ensuring that offline equipment can function effectively as needed for the plant. It is unlikely that a single rule will be suitable for all plants.

            <p>Terrance, it is important to note that the most critical periods for equipment are during startup and shutdown. It is advisable not to halt equipment just to switch to a spare. Instead, keep the equipment running, closely monitor its performance, and only take it out of service when monitored parameters show signs of deterioration. Remember to prioritize equipment maintenance during these crucial stages to prevent any potential issues. - Steve</p>

            <p>In industrial settings, it is crucial to maintain equipment running smoothly during start-up and shutdowns. Instead of halting a piece of equipment to switch to a spare, it is important to keep it running, closely monitoring its performance. Only remove the equipment from service when monitored parameters suggest a degradation. This approach will help ensure efficiency and prevent unnecessary downtime.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about strategies for maximizing equipment availability, Terrence O'Hanlon sought advice on the best approach for running spare equipment. Should one wait for a unit to fail before switching to the spare, alternate between units on a weekly basis, or implement a scheduled rotation of equipment? While some maintenance divisions rotate equipment periodically, others do not. It is acknowledged that a one-size-fits-all philosophy may not be applicable when it comes to rotating equipment. Instead of a rigid philosophy, a brainstorming session within the forum could help create a list of pros and cons for rotating spare equipment. This list can assist maintenance activities in making informed decisions. For instance, periodic rotation can serve as training for operators and mechanics, promoting familiarity with the equipment and optimizing performance. Additionally, running equipment can help circulate lubricants and prevent issues, as suggested by a mechanic recommending periodic use of car air conditioning for maintenance purposes.</p>

            <p>Before delving deeper, it is crucial to first clarify the definition of "spare." Some may view spares as equipment that is not currently in use and stored away, while others see it as installed and ready for immediate use, with all connections set up but isolated. This concept is often referred to as redundancy. By isolating the other equipment and pressing the start/stop button, the spare can seamlessly take over. This recommendation is based on this approach.</p>

            <p>To combat the harsh Florida weather conditions, the risk of rodent infestation, and the effects of time on equipment, I implement a weekly rotation of redundant machinery. Exposure to direct sunlight, humidity, and ocean air can lead to seals drying out, bearing lubrication coagulating, and drive belts cracking. Inactive equipment is prone to false brinneling in bearings and a lack of circulating lubrication, leaving surfaces vulnerable to damage upon start up. While start ups and shut downs can stress systems, prolonged inactivity can lead to premature failure. Ensuring equipment is regularly in operation is essential to maintaining its functionality when needed, preserving the effectiveness of redundancy.</p>

            <p>Regular maintenance and operation of electrical equipment is crucial to prevent degradation over time. Components like contacts, relays, starters, solenoids, etc. should be regularly operated to prevent corrosion from humidity and the elements. For example, manufacturers recommend exercising VFD units every six months to maintain the health of capacitors. Similarly, computers benefit from periodic shutdowns and restarts to allow the operating system to reset.

To ensure equal run time, air compressor tandem units are programmed at the factory with alternating use options, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. Valves should also be exercised regularly as part of a preventive maintenance program. Stagnant flow in piping can lead to issues with precipitants and corrosion, highlighting the importance of using corrosion inhibitors and other additives in oils to keep systems running smoothly.

Federal regulations mandate that emergency generators are operated for four hours per month, with periodic load bank testing recommended to burn off carbon accumulations from low-load operation. While frequent start-ups and shut-downs can cause stress on systems, the greater detriment comes from not operating them at all. Finding the right cycling period is essential, as cycling every hour is too frequent and every year is too infrequent. Each piece of equipment requires a specific cycling period based on its operating conditions.</p>

            <p>While these failure mechanisms apply to standby equipment, it is not justified to replace a functional piece of equipment with one that is not working. Maintenance activities, rather than startup, are needed to address these issues. Regular visual inspections can help identify any potential issues, and cycling equipment without load can reduce the risk of failure. Starting equipment under load conditions when its condition is unknown can lead to high stress and increase the chances of the spare equipment failing shortly after being switched. Reliability is not necessarily improved by cycling equipment; instead, proper preventive maintenance activities are key to maintaining the condition of standby equipment. Although legally required, starting and stopping diesel generators does not guarantee their functionality in times of need and can actually lead to equipment degradation, reducing the likelihood of successful operation in the future.</p>

            <p>I firmly believe in the saying "use it or lose it." When it comes to spares versus backup equipment, I distinguish between items kept in the warehouse as spares and those installed as backup or stand-by equipment to replace the lead machine when needed. This brings me to the concept of lead and lag equipment. I have multiple pieces of backup equipment, such as four pumps where typically only one is required, but occasionally two pumps are needed. To ensure proper functioning and prevent issues like electrical problems and false brinelling, I have a rotation system in place. By programming each pump to run for a specific percentage of time, we can avoid any simultaneous failures and ensure compliance. This proactive approach is important because a backup unit that is not regularly used may fail prematurely. I have witnessed instances where bearings deteriorated from lack of use, rendering the machine inoperable after being on stand-by for just a year. It is crucial to rotate and maintain backup equipment to prevent such failures.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Before we proceed, it is important to establish the key premises that will guide our discussion and understanding of the topic at hand. Firstly, in this context, the term "spare" will specifically refer to installed spare equipment. Secondly, the operational failure modes under consideration are equipment stopping while running and equipment failing to start.

In a typical scenario with redundancy, such as 1 out of 2 (1oo2), 2 out of 3 (2oo3), 2 out of 4 (2oo4), or 3 out of 4 (3oo4) spare arrangement, the most effective options for enhancing system reliability, managing risk, and minimizing maintenance costs include:

- Clearly designating the duty and standby equipment
- Continuous operation of the duty equipment
- Testing and loading the standby equipment for a minimum of 4-8 hours, while taking relevant readings such as vibration and condition monitoring (CM) data
- Restarting the duty equipment after the test period

Exceptions to this protocol may apply in situations where equipment start-up is complex, in which case the test duration can be extended to a week or a month, following an unequal running principle (e.g., 90:10 or 75:25 ratio). Additionally, if the equipment has a known predominant failure mode with lengthy lead times for spare parts (e.g., 12-24 months), maintenance schedules should be synchronized accordingly to minimize total starts and align with overhaul cycles.

For further insights into the rationale behind these operational strategies, please consult pages 168-170 of the book titled 'Effective Maintenance Management - Risk and Reliability Strategies for Optimizing Performance,' authored by V. Narayan (Vee) and published by Industrial Press Inc. (ISBN 0 8311 3178 0).</p>
