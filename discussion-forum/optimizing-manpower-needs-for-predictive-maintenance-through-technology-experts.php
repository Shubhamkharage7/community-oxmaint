            <p>In order to receive helpful responses, it is important to provide more details such as equipment type, condition, and age. Additional information will invite input from those with experience in similar programs. Interestingly, I am preparing to submit an application for the Lockheed F23 program tonight.</p>

Our 50-year-old plant, specialized as an aerospace contractor, faces challenges in navigating through various areas and requires thorough risk mitigation strategies just to access certain zones.

            <p>The number of machine inspections, the time allocated per inspection, and the frequency of inspections determine the manpower needed. In my experience, I found it difficult to hire trained personnel capable of performing various types of inspections. Initially, I hired one person for every 100 machine inspections, and would increase the team size as necessary. I eventually settled on a vibration analysis technician, whom I later sent to school for thermography training. However, he left for a better-paying job after five months. Employees with multiple qualifications are in high demand and may switch jobs more frequently.</p>
