                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently swamped with quotations that need to be completed. I'm wondering if anyone has a specific method or "rule of thumb" for estimating programming costs for projects. I am specifically referring to the cost for developing a ladder-type program, excluding any other expenses such as software, cables, hardware, startup, or documentation.

My current approach involves using a set "day rate" in a spreadsheet and making an educated guess based on past experiences to determine how many days or fractions of days it will take to create the program. However, I am considering implementing a budgetary price for each input/output (I/O) to make the process more precise.

It's important to note that my quotations also include costs for skid wiring, panel shop assembly, documentation, and profit margin markups for the entire project. Therefore, the programming cost is not the deciding factor in the overall project.

I am seeking a more specific method for determining quotes rather than relying solely on estimates. Thank you for any insights you can provide.</p>

            <p>It can be quite challenging to estimate a programming job accurately. One effective method is to request a detailed machine operation flow chart from the end user. This helps gauge their understanding of the system and their ability to communicate it clearly. If they provide a Grafcet chart, it indicates a strong grasp of the machine's operations. On the other hand, if they struggle to articulate the details and only talk about it verbally, it could signify potential trouble ahead.

End users often lack the comprehensive understanding and analytical perspective necessary for programming. While they may possess individual details, they may struggle to see the bigger picture required for successful programming. As a general guideline, a lack of understanding from the end user may result in higher hardware costs (x5), while a clear and detailed flow chart can lead to lower hardware costs (x2).

Remember, this is just a general rule of thumb based on experience and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>I'm in search of hardware recommendations. Is it a good idea to use 5 units for a program with a confusing layout and 2 units for a well-documented layout? My aim is to save time and get an accurate quote. Do professionals consider I/O when calculating costs, such as 16 digital inputs plus 6 digital outputs at $100 each?</p>

            <p>When faced with uncertainty, it's important to focus on breaking down tasks rather than just input/output considerations. Input/output counts can sometimes be deceptive, especially depending on the balance between processes and permissions.

Pierre's argument about using process descriptions to determine hardware costs is valid. It assumes that those who struggle with defining processes may also struggle with assessing hardware needs. However, this may not always be the case.

Personally, I often find myself underestimating the time needed for a project when I try to give a realistic estimate. I find it helpful to analyze the tasks or processes that the programmable logic controller (PLC) needs to perform. This insight has led me to adjust my estimates accordingly.

It's important to gain experience by working on several projects to understand your programming speed and process definition capabilities. In the meantime, it's wise to err on the side of caution and bid higher on hours. Tracking your actual time against your estimates will help you adjust for future projects.

While I don't have any foolproof suggestions, starting with Pierre's idea may be a good starting point. It's all part of the learning process.Keith</p>

            <p>When determining the cost of a project, it's important to consider more than just the price of hardware. Adding your profit margin is crucial, but you should also take into account the amount of work involved. If you have a detailed flow chart, you can estimate the job based on a daily rate and then add 15% for any unexpected costs. If you don't have a flow chart, create one and send it to your customer for approval. If they do not respond promptly or ask for unreasonable changes, consider adding 50% to your estimate.
It is essential to have the customer sign off on the flow chart before starting work. This gives you the leverage to request approval for any significant changes that may arise. Additionally, if you have a Human Machine Interface (HMI), keep the customer informed throughout the process to avoid any surprises or disappointments at the end.
Remember, communication is key to a successful project completion.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, Robert here. Currently in Egypt, we are analyzing the programming cost based on the number of I/O's, while also considering the hours required for programming. As a general rule, I calculate by multiplying the number of I/O's by a certain factor, then compare that result to the product of expected working hours and the daily rate. I always offer the higher figure to my client. I do not base my calculations solely on hardware prices, although some competitors do multiply by a minimum of 3. I hope this information proves helpful. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, up to this point, I have been estimating the number of days needed for programming based on my past experiences. However, this method always leaves me uncertain. I am looking for a mathematical formula to eliminate this uncertainty. Currently, I am working on simple programs with minimal complexity, such as no math calculations, few subroutines, and limited analog signals. This is why I believe the I/O X $ method could be beneficial.

Arik, could you or anyone else share a sample of your flow chart? I typically use a text logic layout to verify program functionality. Here is a brief example:

Pump A in Manual Mode:
1. Press the start button to begin pump operation.
2. Pump will stop if the level is low.
3. Press the start button again to restart the pump once the level is restored.
4. Press the stop button to halt pump operation.
5. Emergency stop button will deactivate all functions.

Pump A in Automatic Mode:
1. Pump will start when the tank reaches a high level.
2. Pump will stop when the level drops too low.
3. Pump will automatically restart once the high level is reached again.
4. Emergency stop button will deactivate all functions.</p>

            <p>When determining pricing, it is not advisable to solely rely on I/O count multiplied by hardware cost, especially with the decreasing affordability of PLC hardware. It is essential to consider functionality as the primary pricing factor. While simple machines may require basic programming, complex equipment may necessitate more advanced programming despite minimal changes in I/O count. Factors such as interfacing with HMI or SCADA, discrete control, process control, and data handling features should also be taken into account. Additional safety features, function interlocking, and emergency/start up/shut down routines can be incorporated as per the customer's requirements. Start with the basic machine operation and offer to add features post-installation for a nominal fee. Customers are usually willing to pay for extra features if presented correctly and may even pay for additional programming hours. Providing exceptional service may even lead to being hired as a permanent consultant.</p>
