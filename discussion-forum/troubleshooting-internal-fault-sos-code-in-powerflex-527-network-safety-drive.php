            <p>I have yet to implement networked safety on PowerFlex drives, but I have a few important questions to consider:

1) Is this a new installation, or is it an existing system that used to be operational?
2) With networked safety in place, is the safety PLC connected and functioning properly?
3) If the safety PLC is connected, is there confirmation that it is successfully communicating with the drive?
4) Once communication is established, is the safety PLC sending the necessary "safety ok" signal?
5) When utilizing CIP Safety over Ethernet/IP, is it necessary to have the STO jumper installed on the drive? The manual for this specific drive may provide the answer.</p>

            <p>Hello Joseph, I have an existing application running on a Safety PLC that is currently online and connected to a drive. However, I am experiencing a safety fault issue where the drive automatically inhibits and cannot be reset. Are there any options available for performing a factory reset? I attempted to utilize the Drive Executive application tool to connect to the drive, and while it was able to identify the drive's presence, I was unable to establish a connection.</p>

            <p>The drives in question are not officially endorsed by Drive Executive. It is recommended to use Connected Components Workbench (CCW) instead. Are you equipped with the necessary safety PLC access?</p>

            <p>SGPeruma reported an issue with the PowerFlex 527 Network-based safety drive displaying an internal fault SOS Code. Despite attempts to manually clear the fault or using logic, the issue persisted. After changing the module and configuring the IP, the fault was successfully cleared. However, similar problems have been encountered in three different drives. The specific fault code is actually S05, indicating a safe torque off fault. It is important to determine whether the drive is using CIP safety or wired safety with red terminals. If using red jumpers, check the safety circuit and ensure the terminals are receiving 24V. For CIP safety, double-check that the jumpers are removed as leaving them in can cause issues. It is essential to verify the safety program's integrity as it relies on internal logic for safety.</p>

            <p>SGPeruma inquired about a possible solution for a safety PLC issue causing the drive to be unable to reset despite being online. Asking if a factory reset is possible and attempting to use the Drive Executive application tool, but encountering connectivity issues. joseph_e2 suggested using Connected Components Workbench (CCW) instead of Drive Executive for better compatibility. It was also mentioned that the drives are typically programmed directly in Studio 5000 with ControlLogix/CompactLogix, rather than with CCW or Drive Executive.</p>
