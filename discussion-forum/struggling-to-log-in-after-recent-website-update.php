By clicking on the link sent to their email, they were able to reset their password and regain access to their account. Another user echoed this sentiment, mentioning that they also had to reset their password but had difficulty remembering the associated email address. It may take several attempts to successfully recover access to your account in such situations.</p>

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Rob also faced a similar issue where the system stated his user did not exist when trying to reset the password for his old account. The email address for the old account was updated to match the one in the new account, and both were sent a link to reset the password.

            <p>ParkyL mentioned a situation where they requested a password reset but only received the email two days later. Consequently, they created a new account. Upon receiving the reset link today, it did not work and showed an error message saying "Something went wrong." The email for the password reset was linked to the new account, which may be causing issues for the old account. However, as the new account is functioning properly, it seems to be resolved. We understand the frustration and apologize for any inconvenience caused.
