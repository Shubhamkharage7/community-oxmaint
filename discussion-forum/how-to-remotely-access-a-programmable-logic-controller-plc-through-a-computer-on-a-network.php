            <p>Is there a way to ping a Mitsubishi PLC on a production line through a connected PC acting as a gateway? The PLC is connected to the PC via Ethernet cable and fully integrated with it, making it visible from the PC. The PC is also connected to an internet network and the same subnet as a server. However, the server cannot ping the PLC directly. How can I use the connected PC as a gateway to ping the PLC successfully?</p>

            <p>One of the most reliable and secure methods is to set up a VPN server on your office network. This requires your Internet provider to allocate a static IP address or utilize a dynamic DNS service. Certain routers come with dynamic DNS capabilities. Additionally, make sure to enable Remote Desktop on your office Windows computer to remotely access your PC with the same functionality as if you were physically present. This setup allows for seamless control of your computer from any remote location.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a secure solution for remote access to your office network, setting up a VPN server is your best bet. This involves getting a public and static IP from your Internet provider or using a dynamic DNS service. Some routers come with the option for dynamic DNS configuration. Additionally, enabling Remote Desktop on your office Windows computer allows you to control it from a remote location. This setup, often referred to as a "jump server", is considered the gold standard for remote access. However, if you need to access data from a PLC, you'll need to have the PLC connected to the internet or use middleware on the PC to push the data up.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the era of remote work, VPN has become essential for businesses, especially post-Covid-19 pandemic. Companies that quickly shifted to a work-from-home setup likely have a VPN server in place. The recommendation here is to restrict access to the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to a designated PC only, keeping it isolated from the local network. This ensures that access to the PLC is limited to that specific computer.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To optimize your Windows PC for routing, you can enable the functionality that allows VPN connections to access different network interfaces on the same device. By modifying the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters and changing the value of IPEnableRouter from 0 to 1, you can enable this feature. After making this adjustment, remember to reboot the PC for the changes to take effect.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my unique situation, a visual aid proved to be beneficial. By modifying the registry entry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters" and changing the parameter "IPEnableRouter" from 0 to 1, I successfully connected to the PLC. Additionally, I had to use the command prompt to add a route specifying that all connections to Subnet_A should go through PC1 as the gateway: cmd>Route add 192.160.x.x (subnet_A) mask 255.255.255.0 IP_PC1. 

I am now considering the scalability of this solution, as I have multiple production lines with the same PLC<->PC setup. Are there better alternatives that could be implemented? Your assistance has been greatly appreciated and invaluable.</p>

            <p>In a recent conversation, Brago discussed a unique situation that required some technical adjustments for connecting to a PLC. By tweaking the registry settings to enable routing on the TCP/IP parameters, Brago was able to establish a connection successfully. Additionally, a manual route was added via the command line to ensure all traffic destined for Subnet_A would pass through PC1 as the gateway. However, with multiple production lines utilizing the same PLC-PC setup, scalability and efficiency are now a concern. Are there better solutions available for this scenario? Your insights are greatly appreciated. I have considered exploring similar configurations on Linux in the past, and it's encouraging to see them work seamlessly on Windows.</p>
