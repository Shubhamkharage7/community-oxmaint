            <p>DarrylR pointed out the importance of checking the control wiring and ensuring the safety inputs are being used to operate the drive effectively. We have implemented the Safe Off Torque board as requested by the customer, with wiring instructions of +24VDC to SP+ and SE+ and 0VDC to SP- and SE-, while removing the jumper as advised.

rkukl suggested exploring the option of using an analog input on the main control board instead of the add-on I/O module to resolve the issue of the drive not responding to the reference speed and running at minimum speed. Additionally, parameter 300 is set to Hz for optimal performance.

For further troubleshooting, it is recommended to refer to the manual publication 750-IN111B-EN-P for checking the jumpers and ensuring they are correctly set to Current mode on the 22-Series I/O module.

Thank you to all for the valuable responses and guidance provided.</p>

            <p>I have not yet utilized the STO board in conjunction with a PF755. Assuming that is not the root of the issue, it is important to check your motor control mode settings (P0/35). It appears that autotune may have been activated for a permanent magnet motor configuration. If your motor is not PM and you have adjusted the control mode, have you performed a new autotune session? Is the application speed-regulated? During troubleshooting, other settings such as torque control or position control may have been unintentionally adjusted. To track the active control mode, monitor P0/313. The control specifications per mode are outlined in P0/309-312. Consult the control block diagrams in Appendix B of (750-pm001-en-p) to identify any potential limitations. Access these diagrams with live data if you are online in CCW. There are various paths that can be followed between P0/2 and P0/1.</p>

            <p>I am embarrassed to admit that I am back with an update for any viewers who may find themselves facing a similar situation in the future. After finally arranging a teams meeting with my Distributor, I shared my screen to show him the parameters I had configured. During the meeting, he examined parameter 420 Drive O/L, which was set to its default value of 3. His assessment confirmed my suspicions - the drive was restricting the Output Frequency due to a potential mechanical or other issue. Despite the motor spinning freely when turned by hand, I decided to release the belt tensioner and remove the belts for further inspection. It was during this process that I noticed the motor wiring, which had not been correctly connected. Upon checking the wiring, I discovered that the first phase wire from the drive had come loose from the wire nut. After re-terminating the wire and verifying all other connections, I tested the drive again and found that everything was running smoothly. It turns out that the motor had lost a phase and the drive was simply doing its job to limit the output. This experience taught me a valuable lesson - always double-check the basics when troubleshooting new equipment. I appreciate all the responses and assistance I received during this process. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Forqnc shared an update on a successful troubleshooting session during a team meeting with a distributor. After verifying the parameters on screen, they discovered that a default setting on parameter 420 Drive O/L was limiting the Output Frequency due to a potential mechanical issue. Upon further inspection, they found a loose phase wire on the motor, which was causing the drive to limit the output. This experience taught them to always double-check the basics when encountering problems with new equipment. They now keep an aluminum coupling on their desk as a reminder to "trust but verify" information provided by others. It's crucial to thoroughly check all components to avoid issues like the one they faced with the DC tach generator and gearbox system.</p>
