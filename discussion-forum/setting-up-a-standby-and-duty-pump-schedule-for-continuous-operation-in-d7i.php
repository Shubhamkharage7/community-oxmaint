                    <p>Has anyone successfully set up a standby x duty PM schedule in D7i? Specifically, I am interested in having the main pump run for 12 weeks on and 2 weeks off, while the back-up pump runs for 2 weeks on and 12 off. This setup ensures continuous operation as the back-up pump takes over during main pump servicing. Additionally, vibration readings work orders should be triggered during this transition.</p>

            <p>Incorporating duty and standby maintenance tasks into a CMMS system can provide valuable insights and ensure equipment reliability. Utilizing a multi-level PM approach at the Functional location can allow for separate PMs for duty and standby with vibration checks. Collaboration with IT may be necessary to effectively implement this configuration. Consider three potential options: generating two PM work orders for duty and standby with vibration checks, generating three PM work orders for duty, standby, and vibration checks, or creating one PM work order with three distinct tasks. Evaluate which option aligns best with your PM work order management needs.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How can I set up a standby and duty pump schedule in D7i like the one described in the discussion thread?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To set up a standby and duty pump schedule in D7i, navigate to the scheduling or maintenance section of the software. Input the desired run times for the main pump (e.g., 12 weeks on and 2 weeks off) and the backup pump (e.g., 2 weeks on and 12 weeks off). Ensure that vibration readings and work orders are triggered during pump transition for continuous operation.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What are the benefits of having a standby and duty pump schedule like the one mentioned in the discussion thread?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Having a standby and duty pump schedule ensures continuous operation of the system by alternating between the main pump and backup pump for maintenance and servicing. This setup minimizes downtime and enhances system reliability.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How can I configure vibration readings and work orders to be triggered during the transition between the main pump and backup pump?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - In D7i, you can set up triggers for vibration readings and work orders during pump transitions by customizing the maintenance settings. Specify the conditions under which these actions should be triggered, such as when the main pump goes offline and the backup pump starts operating.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. Can the standby and duty pump schedule described in the thread be customized to suit specific operational requirements?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Yes, the standby and duty pump schedule can be customized in D7i to meet specific operational needs. You can</p>
