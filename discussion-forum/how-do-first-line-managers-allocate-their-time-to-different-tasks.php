                    <p>I recently came across information regarding the percentage of time that planners dedicate to various tasks. I am curious if anyone has come across a similar metric for first-line managers and supervisors. This could include tasks such as working alongside technicians, handling administrative duties (such as timesheets), inputting data on work completed, analyzing data for process improvements, and participating in planning meetings. Can anyone provide insights on how first-line managers allocate their time to different responsibilities in their roles?</p>

            <p>Although my foremen handle all these tasks, mentioning the title "manager" in our workplace can spark a revolt. Managers earn high salaries, while we are simply seen as the "maintenance" staff.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the salary of maintenance managers, it's clear that they are often very underpaid considering the amount of headache they deal with. However, it's easy to idealize the situation on the other side of the fence.</p>

            <p>One important question to consider is how Managers allocate their time, specifically in terms of prioritizing important tasks versus dealing with urgent matters - a concept popularized by Stephen Covey. This balance between planning for the future and putting out fires in the present is essential for effective leadership and organizational success.</p>
