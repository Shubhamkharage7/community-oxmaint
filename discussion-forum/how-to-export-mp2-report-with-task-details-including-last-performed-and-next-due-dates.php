            <p>Are you utilizing the latest version of MP2? Have you applied all the recent patches? Do you encounter any errors during exporting, or does it appear to be successful with errors only found upon opening the output file? I recently tested the Task Simple List export on my MP2 6.1 with the latest patch, and it ran smoothly.</p>

            <p>It appears that exporting information from multiple sites simultaneously may not be supported. If you're trying to generate a report for seven different sites, consider exporting them individually and then merging the tables. Additionally, when attempting to export a table using Tools/Utility/Export Table, a warning about potential data loss or damage is displayed. Could you please explain what might be affected during the data export process?</p>

            <p>When exporting data in MP2 Access, some users may encounter a lack of warning messages. Which version of MP2 Access are you currently using? It is possible that this warning feature was removed in newer builds. Exporting data should not typically result in any data loss or damage.</p>

            <p>To enhance the visibility of this error for future users seeking information, Nick, please consider creating a new thread specifically addressing this topic instead of adding on to an existing discussion. Jonathan, in the spirit of aiding the MP2 community, encourage individuals to share their responses on the forum rather than through email. Nick, are you familiar with MP2 Designer? It's recommended to avoid using this feature as I frequently receive inquiries from users who have encountered issues with it. We encourage you to share any error codes in this forum for assistance.
