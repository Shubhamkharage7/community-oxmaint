                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am a beginner in Devicenet and have recently downloaded the documentation recommended by AB, a large PDF that helps troubleshoot Devicenet issues. My Devicenet network consists of approximately 21 nodes. In my setup, the last three nodes experience bus off faults, but communication is restored with a power cycle. The resistance between Can L and Can H measures at 60 ohms.

I have observed a low resistance reading from Can L to Earth, approximately 60k Ohms, while Can H to Earth shows an open circuit for resistance. The shields are all bonded at a single point near the middle of the trunk line. Disconnecting the shield from the single point to Earth resulted in an open circuit reading until the bonding was reinstated.

The power supplies in use are three in total, all within the Devicenet specifications. Voltage readings appear satisfactory. Unfortunately, I do not have access to a Devicenet network analyzer. My main concern is that attaching the scanner card to the Devicenet network decreases the resistance reading from Can L to Earth. When the scanner card is removed, the resistance value returns to an open circuit reading.

I am uncertain if the behavior observed with the scanner card is normal or indicative of a need for replacement. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Great job on your troubleshooting efforts! When removing the two termination resistors and disconnecting the power supplies, it is recommended to measure between 10K - 50K between CAN-H and CAN-L. The resistance from CAN to Earth should be very high, showing an open circuit or several megaohms when tested with a standard meter. Make sure to check the scanner module with the entire network disconnected and the PLC powered down.

It is important to note that scanner modules must also have the CAN circuits isolated from the device, just like other components. This is why the network power supply is located separately from the PLC, typically out in the field. If there is a reading of 60K ohms between CAN-L to Earth, this could indicate damage from lightning or other external factors affecting the scanner module.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your input. I will review it the next time I have a chance to work on the plant, as my time is limited each week. This may result in a delayed response, but I value your suggestions and information.</p>
