                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I hope you are well. I need assistance with configuring my Allan Bradley Ultra3000 spindle motor driver for my CNC mill. I was recommended this upgrade by a member of the LinuxCNC forums. However, I am struggling to connect to the driver using Ultraware software. The user manuals mention specific cables that are no longer available, and the pinout diagram indicates an RS-232 serial connection with an RS-485 adapter. I am confused about the process, especially since it mentions that pinouts may vary by manufacturer. Could someone please advise me on the correct cables needed for this setup? I have ordered a USB to serial adapter that is RS-232 and am awaiting its delivery to see if it will work. I also attempted connecting the TX and RX pins to an FT232R module but encountered difficulties. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>For a successful connection between your computer running Ultraware and the Ultra3000, using an RS232 connection is essential. Make sure to connect Pin 2 on the PC to Pin 3 on the Ultra, Pin 3 on the PC to Pin 2 on the Ultra, and Pin 5 on the PC to Pin 5 on the Ultra. This setup requires only Tx, Rx, and GND pins for seamless communication.</p>

            <p>It has been quite some time since I last used one of those devices. I utilized an XP laptop with a built-in serial port for programming purposes. I did not have experience working with RS422 or RS485. Instead, I had a simple homemade three-wire cable with DB9 connections. On page 2-52 of the Ultra3000 Installation manual with the document number 2098-in003_-en-p, there is a diagram provided for RS232 connection. While I understand that pinouts may differ depending on the manufacturer, in this case, it pertains to a standard PC serial port or a standard USB to RS232 DB9 adapter. This could be interpreted as a disclaimer to absolve responsibility in case of compatibility issues with unusual computer setups. I assume you possess a copy of Ultraware software to configure the drive. Additonally, a picture has been shared by Steve.</p>

            <p>I understand that pinout configurations can differ between manufacturers, but in this case, we are dealing with a typical PC serial port or a standard USB to RS232 DB9 adapter. It seems like a cautionary statement to absolve any responsibility for compatibility issues. If your setup does not work as shown in the diagram, try switching the Tx and Rx connections.</p>

            <p>One user, 5618, shared their experience working with an XP laptop that had an on-board serial port for programming tasks. They used a simple homemade three-wire cable with DB9 connections for the setup. However, they never dabbled with RS422 or RS485. Referring to page 2-52 of the Ultra3000 Installation manual 2098-in003_-en-p, they found a diagram for RS232 connection. While acknowledging that pinouts may vary by manufacturer, they highlighted the use of a standard PC serial port or a standard USB to RS232 DB9 adapter. This could serve as a disclaimer to avoid issues with unique computer configurations. The user assumed that the recipient of the message had a copy of Ultraware to configure the drive.

In a follow-up message, the user expressed concerns about connectivity issues despite trying a USB to Serial converter cable and even attempting to cross the wires with no success. They also mentioned using the Recover connection wizard in Ultraware with the newly acquired COM5 port set at 9600. The user questioned if the unit purchased from an eBay seller might be faulty. Additionally, they inquired about connecting to the Ultra3000 without any motors attached, noting that upon powering up, the display only showed 0 with both green and red LEDs flashing. Any insights on this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>If your device isn't communicating as shown in the diagram, try swapping the Tx and Rx connections. I purchased a USB to Serial cable and attempted different configurations, but still couldn't establish a connection. Could the lack of a connected motor be causing the issue, or could it be a faulty unit? I've tested various baud rates ranging from 9600 to 38400. Upon powering up, the display shows 0 and the green and red LEDs flash continuously. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Around 15 years ago, I collaborated on a project involving the Ultra device. During that time, I utilized a laptop featuring a genuine serial port, eliminating the necessity for a USB converter. The laptop was equipped with a 32-bit XP operating system. I encountered issues with certain outdated software, such as GE Logicmaster, struggling to establish serial connections while operating on a 64-bit OS.</p>

            <p>According to Steve Bailey, approximately 15 years ago, he worked on a project involving the Ultra with a laptop equipped with a genuine serial port, eliminating the need for a USB converter. This laptop was running on a 32-bit XP machine. Issues arose when trying to run old software like GE Logicmaster on a 64-bit OS, causing problems with establishing serial communications. Currently, Steve is attempting to use a 32-bit WinXP on an older i686 architecture laptop with an SSD, lacking a real port. He plans to try installing XP on another older laptop with a real port to troubleshoot and determine if the issue lies with the U3k device.</p>

            <p>In response to comment 5618: The image may be a bit obscure, but it seems like you may be connected to pins 3 and 4 of the drive, not 2 and 3. Pin 1 is located at the bottom right, while pin 5 is at the top right. I have made the necessary corrections. It can be hard to distinguish with the black shrink tubing, but it appears that one wire is connected to pin 2 and the other to pin 3. I have tried various solutions. Thank you for your assistance. I am about to install XP on an old laptop with a true Serial port to test if it works. Thank you.</p>

            <p>In determining the gender of a DB9 connector, if the row of five pins is located at the top, it indicates a male connector with connections to pins 5, 3, and 2. Conversely, if the row of five pins is on top for a female connector, it means the connections are to pins 1, 3, and 4. Identifying the correct pin configurations on a male or female DB9 connector is crucial for proper installation and connectivity.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey explained that depending on whether the DB9 connector is male or female and the position of the row of five pins, they may be connected to different pins. He requested for the image to be edited to show black, green, and red lines connecting the pins for clarification. Steve expressed frustration as he had looked at numerous schematics and now cannot determine the correct orientation for connecting the pins. He simply wants the DB9 connector to function as intended for communication purposes. Thank you in advance for any assistance provided.</p>

            <p>In the past, I successfully connected my U3000 using a CP3 cable and gender bender through a real serial port. I recall that the software only recognized COM ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, so when using a USB-serial cable, I had to adjust the port settings accordingly.

            <p>Apologies for my late response, but I just returned from a week-long trip. It's worth noting that certain Ultra drives offer the capability to run a compiled user program, although this functionality may not be relevant to your situation. I have come across instances where the COM port for PC communication was disabled on some drives. Refer to the drive's user manual and check if there is a setting to disable user programs using rotary knobs (such as 888 or similar). If such a setting exists, make the adjustment and power cycle the drive before attempting to connect using standard methods.</p>

            <p>Alan_505 mentioned that he previously used a CP3 cable with a gender bender to connect to the U3000 via a real serial port. The software appeared to only support COM ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, requiring adjustments when using a USB to serial adapter. He discovered that setting the bitrate to 38400 in both Ultraware and the computer's port configuration, as well as unchecking 'Use FIFO' in the advanced settings, resolved connectivity issues. These instructions were not included in the manual, assuming users knew how to connect in the past. Some USB to serial adapters lack the advanced button in Windows XP's port configuration, preventing users from disabling FIFO. When FIFO is enabled, Ultraware frequently disconnects from the U3K, causing interruptions and hindering drive configuration.</p>
