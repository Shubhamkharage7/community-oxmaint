                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am encountering a problem while trying to create a runtime application in Factory Talk View ME Studio. Despite downloading the latest version, V9, the issue persists. I am receiving an error message saying "unable to save tag database," preventing the creation of a .mer file and hindering the testing of the application. I have attempted to resolve the issue by uninstalling and reinstalling V9, as well as RSLinx. Both my design and runtime communication paths are functioning properly. Despite being unable to create a backup in the application manager, I have forwarded the zipped job file to my reseller tech support, who successfully created a runtime application. I am also experiencing difficulties in starting a new project, adding a button, and creating a runtime application. Although I am unsure of the root cause of these issues, I am seeking suggestions for potential solutions. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>At times, rebooting the systems has successfully resolved this issue. If that does not work, consider installing FTView on a standalone machine (or virtual machine if supported by your IT department) as a troubleshooting step. Another option is to perform a clean installation.</p>

            <p>I encountered difficulty creating a backup file in the Application Manager and attempting to restore it. Despite closing FT View and ensuring no processes were running, I received an error message stating that the file was still in use. After consulting with Rockwell, I established a new user account on my PC with administrative privileges, which resolved the issue. Despite my original account having administrator rights, I never altered it. Could there be an issue with Windows causing the Rockwell software to misconstrue my administrative permissions?</p>

            <p>If you encounter issues with FTViewME, a simple solution is to delete the .CAC, .CRC, and .CTL files located in the Tag folder of your HMI project at C:\Users\Public\Documents\RSView Enterprise\ME\HMI projects\[Your Project Name]. After removing these files, reboot your PC to allow the tag database files to be recreated when you reopen the project.

            <p>Dealing with video card driver issues while working on Allen Bradley PLC programs has been a major struggle for me. My Dell Precision M6800 laptop, equipped with an AMD FirePro M6100 video card, has not been ideal for PLC-related tasks. One solution I found was using System Restore to revert back to a previous point where the Dell Precision Optimizer suggested driver updates, potentially including a video card driver.

Although this may not be a definitive solution, running a System Restore to a known good point could possibly resolve the issue. I understand this discussion is from a couple of years ago and the original poster may have already found a fix. I'm sharing my experience in the hopes that it may assist others facing similar problems. Before resorting to a complete operating system reinstallation, trying a System Restore could save you valuable time and effort. Thank you for reading! - fEsTiDiOuS</p>

            <p>In discussing video card driver issues affecting Allen Bradley PLC programs, a user shared their experience with a Dell Precision M6800 laptop and an AMD FirePro M6100 video card. They found that using System Restore to revert back to a previous driver update resolved the issue. While this may not be a universal solution, it could be worth trying before resorting to a full operating system wipe. This information is provided in the hopes of helping others facing similar problems. 
It's important to note that while the graphics card may impact animations in FTVME, it does not directly affect the tag database in HMI software. The reported error is typically linked to file corruption in the tag database, which Rockwell suggests resolving by deleting specific files and rebooting the computer. Rolling back the operating system may also resolve the issue, but it may be a more time-consuming solution than necessary.</p>
