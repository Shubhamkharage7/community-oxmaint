                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Is there a restriction within Connected Components Workbench or on Micro850s regarding the maximum number of Modbus messages that can be transmitted per cycle? Additionally, could there be a limitation on the number of write commands allowed? I was successfully operating 12 temperature controllers using Modbus, but upon adding two more, the additional controllers are not responding to write commands. Despite ensuring all settings are configured correctly and the PLC is able to read the current temperature, the new controllers are still disregarding write commands. I am curious if there is a restriction on the number of write commands that can be sent in a single cycle. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I came across information stating that the limit is 16, but I was unable to locate the specifics to share with you. Are you utilizing Modbus TCP or RTU protocols? If using RTU, have you verified the termination is properly configured? What is the cable distance between the last two devices? Have you checked the baud rate settings and considered adjusting them if necessary?</p>

            <p>I am working with Modbus RTU and have ensured that the termination is set up correctly. However, I have encountered a problem with communication when trying to operate more than 14 temperature controllers. Despite writing a separate program to address the controllers that were not responding, I suspect that I may be exceeding the message limit. In addition to sending set points, I am also controlling the on/off status of the controllers. Your assistance in resolving this issue is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>When working with Modbus RTU, it is important to remember that communication takes place over a single serial line. In my opinion, it is best to send each message individually and wait for it to complete or time out before sending the next one. It has been noted that TCP is restricted to a 4x scan, which is relevant when dealing with these types of controllers.</p>

            <p>Having to send each message individually can be quite a hassle, especially when managing multiple devices. Everything was working smoothly until now, so sending messages separately doesn't seem necessary. It seems like there may be a limit on the number of MODBUS messages that can be included in a program. I attempted to find information on this issue in Rockwell's knowledgebase and came across a relevant resource: example code for "Modbus Message Sequencing for Micro830 (Part of the Micro800 Family)." However, when I tried to download it, I received an isaxml file instead of the expected archive file. Do you have any suggestions on what to do with this file? The resource can be found on the Rockwell Automation website.</p>

            <p>MikeBriggs inquired whether there is a restriction on the number of Modbus messages that can be transmitted per cycle in Connected Components Workbench or on Micro850 PLCs. To clarify, the maximum number of messages that can be sent per cycle is less than 1 if a cycle refers to a scan cycle. However, if the query is regarding the maximum number of Modbus messages that can be queued for transmission per cycle, then the answer differs. It is possible that the limit is around 12 or 13, allowing for transmission in two batches of 7 each. If you are utilizing the MSG_MODBUS instruction, what parameters are required to send 12 messages to 12 distinct Modbus Slave IDs in a single scan cycle? Please share the code either in a .ZIP file or as a PDF.</p>

            <p>When using Modbus RTU serial communication, it is important to send messages one at a time to ensure optimal performance. Despite any internal buffering that may be in place, it is best practice to trigger each message sequentially to avoid any issues. By following this method, you can effectively transmit as many messages as needed without overloading the processor. While it may be tempting to overanalyze the technical aspects, sometimes it is best to simply dive into coding.</p>

            <p>When troubleshooting network issues, it is crucial to meticulously check all terminations. Despite experiencing problems for years on a network constructed in 2018, I decided to reterminate every wire before leaving town. However, this did not initially resolve the issue. After experimenting with timing adjustments to no avail, the network miraculously started functioning just as I was about to give up.

In dealing with Modbus RTU and encountering timeouts, it is essential to reduce overhead. Three strategies can help alleviate this issue. Firstly, instead of reading each register individually, consider performing a block copy when there are only a few words between the registers of interest. Aim for approximately 2-3 words between reads before opting to read the entire block for efficiency.

Additionally, implementing a data transfer cycle and utilizing a buffer for reads can ensure a more robust system. A timing mechanism set to around every 100 ms, with the ability to adjust for stability, is recommended. Pair this with a counter that increments with each timeout, triggering a read operation at designated intervals.

Regarding writes, it is advisable to minimize constant writing unless absolutely necessary. Separate write operations can be included in the counter used for reads. An example method for handling writes is provided:

- Store read values in PLC Memory
- Write values to be sent to the device into a separate section of PLC Memory
- If the stored read value differs from the write value and the write value is not -1, initiate a write operation to the device
- If the stored read value matches the write value, reset the write value to -1

Feel free to substitute -1 with any unused value. This approach can help streamline write operations and optimize network performance.</p>
