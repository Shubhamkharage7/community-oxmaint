            <p>I have been fortunate enough to work with the LOGO! PLC on several occasions. It is undeniably one of the most innovative controllers on the market. While I personally prefer the familiarity of the Micro800, the LOGO! offers a unique user experience. Its user-friendly interface and affordable price make it a great choice for programming. I highly recommend purchasing the software for optimal programming efficiency. In my experience using the LOGO! in industrial settings, they have proven to be durable and reliable even after years of heavy use.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I installed a TECO unit in my detached garage for its affordability and included software. I found the TECO LOGO to be comparable. This unit was used to control lighting, power outlets, and heating based on temperature, but nothing too advanced. While it served its purpose, I do not recommend programmable relays for home automation as they lack the sophistication needed for smartphone apps and advanced automation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After examining the logo, I suspect it bears similarities to others in the market. I concur that there are numerous small options available, such as AB's PICO. However, I align with Pie_Guy's recommendation of opting for the Micro820 or Siemens 1200. In my experience, investing in a proper PLC like the Micro820 or Siemens 1200 is more beneficial, as small smart relays often leave me wishing for the capabilities of a full PLC. Despite the slightly higher price, the added functionality and value make it a worthwhile investment.</p>

            <p>The LOGO micro-PLC is a versatile and efficient option for programming, with compatibility with IDEC units under a different brand. The LOGO software seamlessly identifies IDEC units as Siemens, allowing for easy programming. However, the IDEC software may encounter issues with Siemens files. In smaller projects, Crouzet micro-PLC's have been successfully utilized.</p>

            <p>Hello, one great feature of the new LOGO8! series with FS4 or higher firmware is the inclusion of Modbus TCP compatibility.

            <p>During my visit to SPS Nürnberg, I had a conversation with someone who seemed to be a developer for Logo.Cameras were not available yet, but there was a significant presence of home automation among their colleagues. A house drawing at the logo8 booth occupied a large portion of the display. Looking ahead, discussions for next year's event will likely focus on the introduction of these features. The upgrade process would involve a hardware replacement for the new version.</p>

            <p>During my visit to SPS Nürnberg, I had a conversation with an individual who appeared to be a Logo developer. They mentioned that cameras are not yet available, but many of their colleagues have incorporated home automation systems in their houses. At the Logo8 stand, there was a prominent display of a house drawing, indicating potential future features. The developer hinted at the possibility of these features being released at the next event. Upgrading to the new version would require a hardware replacement.

I am particularly keen on integrating cameras for a comprehensive one-stop solution, but it seems like I may have to explore other options for that aspect and stick with Logo for the rest. Have you had any experience using Siemens' VMS?</p>

            <p>Updating an old discussion to highlight that the latest IDEC and LOGO models are no longer completely compatible. To ensure seamless operation, it is essential to have the corresponding software such as WindLGC or Logo!Soft Comfort. I personally encountered this issue and it was validated and confirmed in this post.</p>
