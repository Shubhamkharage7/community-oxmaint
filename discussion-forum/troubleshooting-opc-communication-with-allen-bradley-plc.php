            <p>Hello there. Based on my understanding, Rockwell PLCs do not include OPC UA functionality. If your project requires accessing data from an OPC UA server, there are multiple ways to accomplish this. I can suggest middleware options that may require a financial investment. Alternatively, members of this community who are knowledgeable in Python might recommend open-source solutions that require some effort on your part. I can provide you with my solution, but it comes with a price tag of several hundred dollars per license. It's worth noting that I am not selling this software. If you prefer open-source options, let's hope for some helpful recommendations.</p>

            <p>I have saved this thread for future reference in case I need to use the ControlLogix v36 OPC UA Server. Hello everyone, I am excited to share my discoveries on setting up the new OPC UA server, especially for those interested like JeremyM :lolis:. Rockwell's documentation on this topic is limited, but I have reached out to them for more information. Stay tuned for updates! Visit www.plctalk.net for more insights.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the responses. I was able to successfully configure my 1756-L82E PLC to communicate with an OPC simulation server, using both ProSys and UaAnsiC. These are popular free OPC Sim servers. Setting up the connection involved having one laptop as the OPC server host, the PLC as the client, and going online with the PLC on another laptop, all connected via a simple switch.

However, I encountered challenges when trying to establish a connection with an OPC server that requires SSL certificates. Despite my efforts to reinstall the certificate, I have not been able to resolve this issue. If anyone has insights on this matter, I would greatly appreciate it.

One helpful tip that may benefit others is that AB PLCs may encounter difficulties when the OPC server URL includes the server address at the end. For instance, "opc.tcp://169.254.127.244:48020/OPCUA/SimulationServer" does not work, while "opc.tcp://169.254.127.244:48020" works perfectly. This distinction could potentially save others from similar compatibility issues.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After encountering difficulties with establishing a direct connection between the customer OPC server and the PLC, I found success by incorporating FT Optix as an intermediary. This setup now involves communication flow from the OPC server to FT Optix to the PLC, enabling seamless messaging between the PLC client and other networked devices. To host FT Optix, options include the 1756-UM021A-EN-P (designed to fit into a control logix rack), the Factory Talk Optix HMI, or a separate PC to run the Factory Talk Optix software. The first two options include the necessary software, while the third option requires separate purchase of the software and a PC. In terms of pricing, the first two options likely offer the most cost-effective solution.</p>

            <p>According to tlf30, starting from version 36, the 1756-L8x controllers now support OPC UA through their built-in Ethernet port. It is important to note that while the 5380 compact logix controllers are compatible with V36, the L306ER model does not work with OPC. This is the only 5380 controller that has this limitation. Despite my experience with OPC UA, it is also compatible with OPC DA. This new feature was introduced around January 2024, but there are still some issues that need to be resolved.</p>
