            <p>Burn-in is a process designed to weed out components with defects that could lead to premature failure. By subjecting the population to elevated stress conditions, such as high temperatures, faulty components are identified and removed during burn-in, resulting in a final population with a potentially higher Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). It's important to note that while the reliability of the surviving components may improve post-burn-in due to defect removal, the individual lifespan of each component is likely shortened. The relationship between component lifespan and temperature is crucial in determining the effectiveness of burn-in procedures, as higher temperatures during burn-in could accelerate the aging process of the components. By understanding the relationship between temperature and component lifespan, as well as the distribution of component time to failure, one can assess the impact of burn-in on the overall failure distribution curve. Collecting data on failure times for components under different burn-in temperatures can also provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the burn-in process.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. What is the impact of increased burn-in temperatures (130C vs 110C) on inductors and transformers in terms of failure rates?
- Operating components at higher temperatures than intended can lead to increased failure rates due to potential overheating, insulation breakdown, or accelerated aging of materials.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can the effect of increased burn-in temperatures on inductors and transformers be measured?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The effect of increased burn-in temperatures on components can be measured by observing changes in parameters like inductance, resistance, and insulation resistance before and after exposure to higher temperatures. Techniques such as thermal imaging, electrical testing, and visual inspection can also help assess any damage or degradation.</p>
