                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, has anyone encountered a problem with the High-Speed Counter (HSC) on the 2080-LC20 PLC? The PLC is being used on a cut off press, and occasionally, after resetting the HSC to zero, it fails to count. We have tried various methods to reset the HSC, but sometimes it gets stuck and requires powering down the PLC to reset it. Please see the attached printout. Any ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this issue?</p>

            <p>In all honesty, I have found that the 800 series PLCs and their high-speed functions often encounter issues. When attempting to use the HSC for an encoder, I consistently faced glitches. As a workaround, I opted for lower resolution encoders or developed my own pulse counter logic, albeit with limited success. It is crucial to adjust the scan rate on the input terminal or designate it as high-speed. The specific terminology used in CCW for this escapes me at the moment. Furthermore, it is important to monitor the controller scan rate with these 800 series PLCs, as excessive code can easily slow their operation to the 1/2 - 1 1/2 second range.</p>
