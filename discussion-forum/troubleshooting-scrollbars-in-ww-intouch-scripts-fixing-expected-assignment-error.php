                    <p>Hello everyone! I am implementing various window sizes in my application, and some require both horizontal and vertical scrollbars to ensure the user can view the full content. I came across TechNote429 online, but I am struggling to make it work. Every time I try to input the script, I encounter an "Expected Assignment" error and cannot complete it. The script I am using is as follows: "Horizontal_Position = #HorzScrollBar.Value; MoveWindow( WindowName, 0 - Horizontal_Position, 0 - Vertical_Position, ThisWindowWidth, ThisWindowHeight);". If anyone has a solution to this issue or a more effective method, please assist me!</p>

            <p>I have never tried to do this before, mainly because it is not a good design practice. It is important to ensure that your windows are tailored to fit your display or to troubleshoot any scripting errors that may arise. When you encounter the "Expected Assignment" error, your cursor will indicate the exact location of the mistake in your script. This error could be caused by simply copying and pasting a script without including the required tags for it to function properly.</p>

            <p>Here is a script example from WonderWare that can be used to move a window to the left by 460 pixels: 
WWMoveWindow("WindowName", -460,5,2724, 647). This feature is helpful for windows with a high number of graphic elements that cannot fit within a regular screen size. The data in the off-screen window continues to update without delay when scrolled over. This method is faster than switching between multiple windows. I have only implemented this in a few applications where it was appropriate. It is a valuable tool to have in your arsenal.
The error you are encountering is likely due to text in the script that the software interprets as tags, but they have not been defined as such. You can use numbers or memory tags and load values into them using additional scripting techniques. Personally, I prefer to use tags for this purpose.</p>

            <p>gmferg shared a helpful tip from WonderWare regarding moving windows within an application. By utilizing a script like the one provided, you can easily adjust the position of a window on the screen. This can be particularly useful when you want to display more graphic elements than what fits within a standard screen size. The window will continue to update off-screen data seamlessly without any delay when scrolled over, providing a smoother experience compared to switching between multiple windows. This technique can be a valuable addition to your toolkit for enhancing user interface design.

On the other hand, SkyTech is facing issues with implementing horizontal and vertical scrollbars in different window sizes for their application. They encountered an error message stating "Expected Assignment" while trying to execute a script found in TechNote429. The script aims to adjust the position of a window based on scrollbar values. If you have any insights on resolving this error or have alternative methods for achieving the desired functionality, your assistance would be greatly appreciated. 

Additionally, a simple solution was implemented by utilizing a Key event and a specific integer variable. By controlling the position of a page within a window using a script like the one provided, you can easily scroll up or down based on predefined conditions. This approach involves adjusting the vertical position of the window by 100 pixels at a time to navigate through the content smoothly within a page size of 2000 pixels.</p>
