                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, greetings from sunny India! I am reaching out to the forum members who are knowledgeable about CNC Machines. Is there a correlation between the operating hours of CNC machines and their breakdown time? We are planning to double the running hours in order to increase production. What are the main reasons that could cause a CNC machine to breakdown? Is there a probability curve related to wear and tear, or any data on the likelihood of failure in CNC Machines when they operate for longer periods at their maximum capacity? I am new to this technology and the plant, so any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. For instance, at 150,000 running hours, a set of machines may experience equipment failure after 20,000 hours. We are aiming to increase the running hours to 300,000 with the same set of machines. Thank you and best regards, Vinay.</p>

            <p>I may not have much experience with the reliability of CNC machines, but I believe that 20000 hours of failures for 150000 hours of work is excessive. It is essential to also focus on reducing the duration of these failures. Hopefully, someone with more experience can provide guidance on addressing other concerns.</p>

            <p>Early in my career, I didn't focus on the reliability aspect of milling machines. However, I can attest to the significant impact of the milling techniques and the skill of the operator on the performance. Some operators increase cutting speed to boost production, which, along with material thickness, can put a strain on the rotation assembly. For example, milling 22-gauge aluminum is different from milling 1/2" mild steel. Whether you are using shell milling or light drilling/boring also affects the load torque rate. Keeping product feeders clean can significantly extend their lifespan. I hope this information helps you understand the importance of these factors in milling operations.</p>

            <p>The quality tests conducted on your final product are crucial in determining when repairs are needed. Once the quality tolerance for your widgets is surpassed, repairs become necessary. It's common for certain components or systems in your manufacturing process to not meet the specified number of hours before needing maintenance. By implementing continuous improvement practices, such as investigating failures and creating preventive maintenance tasks, you can prolong the lifespan of your machines. Analyzing machine history can help pinpoint recurring component failures, allowing you to address them proactively and ultimately improve machine reliability. - Dave</p>

            <p>There is a possibility that the CNC OEMs may have some relevant data, but most of these companies operate with minimal resources, resulting in limited availability of current information. The only information at my disposal pertains to spindle failure rates and their causes, presented in a Pareto format. Please refer to the attached PDF for more details. Apologies for any inconvenience. Attached File: SpindleReliability.pdf, 18 KB, 1 version.</p>

            <p>When it comes to CNC equipment, downtime and breakdowns are typically attributed to three main factors. Firstly, the quality and make of the machine play a significant role. High-end Japanese machines tend to experience far fewer breakdowns compared to Korean, Taiwanese, or Haas machines, although they do come with a higher initial cost. Secondly, following preventive maintenance guidelines is crucial for ensuring the longevity of machine components. Proper oiling, greasing, and maintaining air quality are key factors in preventing issues related to air actuated components. Lastly, operator error often leads to major repairs, with collisions between machine components being a common issue in many shops.

In our facility, most of the major rebuilds we deal with stem from operator error, resulting in costly repairs, replacement parts, and lost production time. We aim to minimize these costs by keeping up with preventive maintenance activities, which typically only result in about an hour of downtime per machine per week. Our fleet consists of high-end Japanese machines, with the most common repairs involving failed spindles, ball screws, and guides.

To ensure minimal downtime, we prioritize quick diagnosis and immediate repairs. All of our over 30 CNC machines are serviced in-house by our team, allowing us to swiftly address any issues that arise. This proactive approach has significantly reduced our breakdown periods and helps us keep our production running smoothly. In contrast, relying on external service companies for repairs in the past has often resulted in longer wait times and delays in getting our machines back up and running efficiently.</p>
