            <p>In modern society, it's not uncommon to find Bugs and other pests hiding in unexpected places. For instance, I've witnessed lizards getting fried in packages in Thailand, slugs causing havoc in electronic boxes, ants damaging plastic components, and even a circuit board covered in spider webs. It's important to always be vigilant and check for unexpected intruders in your belongings.</p>

            <p>While engineers may see it from a technical perspective, from the viewpoint of ants, they are simply seeking a warm, dry refuge away from predators. An electrical box 20 feet off the ground may seem like a perfect location to them. If ants had real estate agents, they would be praising the amenities and scenic views. Conversely, if slugs understood the danger of high voltage electricity to water's electrolytes, they would steer clear of electrical boxes. Thailand could easily prevent lizards from entering by sealing up holes properly. Perhaps both species could benefit from more proficient real estate agents!</p>

            <p>BryanG expressed his frustration with Thailand's inability to seal off openings that allow lizards to enter. It is believed by the Thai people that lizards bring good luck and also help in keeping insects at bay.</p>

            <p>The box appeared to be completely sealed, but even the smallest gaps were enough for a lizard to sneak through. These lizards, like King Chuck, can flatten their bodies to just 10-15mm and squeeze through tiny 2mm gaps in cupboards. I once found a fried lizard in a starter box that had a poorly fitting lid, leaving a gap of only about 1mm. It's possible it got in when someone had the lid off, though that seems unlikely. Yes, these lizards are actually quite helpful in homes, as they prey on mosquitoes that sneak inside. They come out at night when the lights are on, hanging around and catching bugs. While I don't mind them, it can be a bit startling when they run down the wall and across your face. It's quite an odd sensation, as they are cold-blooded creatures.</p>

            <p>Attracted to electricity? I once had a pet rabbit that had a peculiar habit of chewing on electrical cords, but only when they were plugged in. When not plugged in, he would simply sniff and walk away. However, once powered, he would gnaw on the cords until they were left with exposed copper wires. Similarly, in our region, there are minuscule spiders that are inexplicably drawn to the scent of natural gas. These spiders tend to nest in gas orifices within HVAC units, causing frequent blockages.</p>
