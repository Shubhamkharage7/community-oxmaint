            <p>Hello Eugene, in my previous role at an OEM car manufacturer, I was involved in service development and support. One important aspect to consider is the regular maintenance tasks outlined in the owner's handbook, such as checking engine oil, coolant, transmission fluid, tire pressure, and lights on a "daily" or "weekly" basis. It is crucial for vehicle users to take responsibility for these tasks to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the vehicle.

For shared vehicles, finding someone to take on this responsibility can be challenging. Maintaining a consistent maintenance history is essential for warranty purposes and to avoid any issues related to neglecting basic servicing. Establishing a calendar schedule based on travel distance or time intervals can help ensure timely and regular servicing for vehicles in your fleet. For example, if the vehicle travels 40,000km per year with 10,000km service intervals, it should be serviced every 3 months on average.

By planning ahead and communicating service requirements in advance to the car's designated user, you can streamline the servicing process and avoid any potential issues. While implementing a calendar schedule may pose challenges, it is worth considering for efficient fleet management.</p>
