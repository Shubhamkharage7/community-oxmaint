                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>One way to enhance user experience on a PLC is by implementing a PopUp screen that appears after a specific condition is met, such as when a bit goes on TRUE. This PopUp screen can also be triggered if a user holds a button pressed for a certain amount of time, regardless of which screen they are on. In the image provided, the button has been set to a 5-second hold time. Is this hold time for the button or the bit? Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a direct workaround for this issue. As of now, the only option found in the View Designer is to set up PopUp displays through navigation.</p>

            <p>Once you have set up your pop-up "group" and applied a visibility tag to ensure it remains hidden unless certain conditions are met, you can easily accomplish this task. Within the Properties menu, you can simply right click on the visibility option and then assign a tag to it, often referred to as an alias. While it has been some time since I last utilized View Designer, I recommend managing your conditions within the PLC. Choose the method that best suits your needs to toggle the visibility tag between true and false, especially if you are utilizing falling edge detection. Additionally, consider using a timer within the PLC to automatically adjust this visibility setting if a specific button is held down for a predetermined amount of time.</p>

JTCat suggests creating a pop-up "group" and using a visibility tag to control its visibility based on certain conditions. This method is the simplest way to achieve this task. 
In the Properties tab, right click on the visibility option and select the option to assign a tag to it (also known as an alias). If you're not familiar with the View Designer tool, don't worry â€“ it's been a while since I've used it too. 
Handle your conditions in the PLC and choose the method that works best for you to set the visibility tag to true or false. You can also use a timer in your PLC to automatically change the visibility based on the length of time a specific button is held down.</p>
