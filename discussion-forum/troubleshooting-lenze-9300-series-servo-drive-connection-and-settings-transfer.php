                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am facing some challenges with a Lenze 9300 Series Servo drive, specifically Type: EVS9326-ETV907, ID-No: 00488381, 33.9326TE.7B.65.V907. I also have a LECOM A/B and Keypad, with the Type: 2102 IBC V001 & EMZ9371BC models. Additionally, I have Global Drive Control 4.14 installed.

I encountered issues with a faulty drive and purchased a used one from a trusted supplier. Despite attempting to transfer settings from a saved keypad, I was unable to access the necessary menus. When trying to restore the used drive to factory defaults through GDC, the software did not recognize the exact model. Although I proceeded with a similar option, the reset did not take effect as expected.

Furthermore, I attempted to copy settings to a new keypad without success. Even after connecting the supposedly faulty drive to GDC for a backup, I encountered errors while trying to load the settings onto the used drive. Any advice or insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

During testing, I used a Lenze MDSKSBS056-33 motor, with specifications including Id.Nr. 00400313 and Motor Nr. 06291983. Despite the motor not appearing in GDC's database, the selected settings allowed me to control it with the original faulty drive. However, the used drive did not produce any results when connected to the motor. It is possible that the used drive is faulty, but I am puzzled as to why I was unable to backup settings on both drives. Any guidance on this issue would be valuable.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the delayed response. The ETV907 version features a servodrive with an integrated PLC. It is not possible to simply copy the entire program using the keypad. Instead, to transfer the program from an old device to a new one, you will need a card module from Lenze. This module, which is attached in the same location as the keypad interface, allows you to save a bin file to an SD card. You can then use the same card module to download the program to the new device.

Ideally, it is recommended to have access to a backup file and download it using the GDC + PLC software. However, in many cases, the backup file from the machine builder may not be available.</p>
