            <p>After reviewing the Knowledgebase, it appears that there was a hardware update from Series A to Series B for the 7" units alongside the release of Version 8.011 and later firmware. Unfortunately, the newer hardware does not support DH485 communication. This means that if you have a Series B terminal with Version 8.011 or later, it will not be able to support DH485. According to the release notes, Rockwell Automation does not plan to reintroduce the removed legacy communication functionality. It is possible that they decided to remove these features to optimize memory usage or testing procedures, as they may not have been in high demand. If you are encountering issues with PanelView 800 firmware v8.011 and the hardware series changes, you may need to consider using an older terminal or exploring alternative platforms to run your desired applications effectively.

            <p>According to Ken Roach's interpretation of the Knowledgebase, a hardware change from Series A to Series B occurred alongside the release of firmware Version 8.011 and later. This new hardware no longer supports DH485 communication. If you have a Series B terminal with firmware 8.011 or later, it will never be able to support DH485. Rockwell Automation does not plan to reintroduce the legacy communication functionality that was removed from these terminals. It is possible that they made this decision to optimize memory usage or testing processes, as the older features were not in high demand. For those needing DH485 support, it may be necessary to locate an older terminal or consider a different platform.
