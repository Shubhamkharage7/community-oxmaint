            <p>You have recommended some incredibly helpful websites to me. It seems like you are quite knowledgeable about TPM. Is TPM related to your line of work? I am curious to hear your thoughts on it. Are you familiar with TPM3 and the 5 pillars commonly used by companies? I find it interesting that Unilever, for example, utilizes TPM3 or a similar approach. In my opinion, it may be excessive to create a one-point lesson on something as simple as closing a door. What are your thoughts on this matter?</p>
