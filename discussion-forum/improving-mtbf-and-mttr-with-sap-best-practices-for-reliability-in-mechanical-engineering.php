                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am seeking advice and recommendations on improving MTBF and MTTR with SAP. As a newcomer to reliability, I come from a background in Mechanical Engineering with 10 years of experience in Condition Monitoring and Rotating Machinery. I am curious about whether MTBF should be calculated for a system, a machine, or a component. For instance, should the cooling water system be considered failed when it stops providing coolant, a rare occurrence with a 2x100% A pump? Should MTBF be assessed separately for the pump and motor, or even down to individual components like bearings, shafts, and impellers? I would appreciate hearing about your perspectives and best practices on this matter.</p>

            <p>According to Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles, failures are defined by the inability to perform their intended function, rather than being solely component-based. Whether it's the pump, motor, controls, or power supply that is failing, if the system cannot operate as designed, it is deemed non-functional. It is crucial to prioritize system functionality over individual components, as a working pump with no way to power it provides no benefit to overall plant operations.</p>

            <p>In interconnected industries, it is common practice to incorporate redundancy or standby components to ensure continuous operations in case of a failure. While the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) may be high or even perfect for the overall system as long as it is running smoothly, the MTBF for redundant components will be zero. It is advisable to measure both to assess the effectiveness of maintenance practices, ideally tracking at least 5 key performance indicators (KPIs). Ultimately, the important aspect to monitor is the trend in the indices to gauge the maintenance performance accurately. Thank you.</p>

            <p>To improve data accuracy, it is important to first identify your objective and work backwards from there. Many businesses face challenges in gathering reliable failure data efficiently. Dependence on systems like SAP is not enough as the accuracy of the data input is crucial. Compiling inaccurate data can be counterproductive and result in poor decision-making. For more insights on data reliability, visit Erik at www.roadtoreliability.com.</p>

            <p>Understanding the importance of a clear objective is crucial. Consider the level of equipment you plan to use for data collection and how you intend to utilize the information. In this scenario, it is likely best to focus on the Pump level, although the motor may also be involved depending on the specific failure and code used. If you are using MTBF to enhance your preventive maintenance strategies or eliminate failures, targeting this level is advisable.</p>

            <p>It is crucial to define your objectives when investigating performance failures. Many begin by seeking the reasons behind the process not meeting its performance goals. Once this is identified, the focus shifts to identifying the specific subsystem or critical asset (such as a machine) that malfunctioned. Starting at a broad level and gradually delving into the root cause is key. In complex systems, a detailed analysis of individual components may be necessary.</p>

            <p>The delivery of services by integrated systems relies on various components like pumps and controls. To determine the overall Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of these services, it is crucial to calculate the overall MTBF.
