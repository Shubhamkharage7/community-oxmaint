                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have Factory Talk View ME installed on 2 PCs at my plant with a single concurrent license. This setup allows me to use the software on one PC at a time by borrowing the license. Recently, I encountered an issue where the program would not start on one of the PCs, displaying an error message asking for personalized information. Despite having the activation on that PC, I still could not use the software. Reinstalling the program did not solve the issue. Before reaching out to Rockwell Support through our corporate IT department, I wanted to see if anyone had any suggestions or ideas.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, I installed the latest Windows updates on my Windows XP SP3 system. However, I encountered an issue when trying to open FactoryTalk View Studio today. A message popped up stating, "This program requires personalized information that cannot be read. Please contact Rockwell Support." To resolve this issue, I uninstalled and reinstalled "FactoryTalk Services", restarted my computer, and successfully opened FactoryTalk View Studio. Yet, another message appeared, instructing me to stop the RSLinx Enterprise service and close RSView before proceeding. Upon checking the Services, I noticed that both the RSLinx Enterprise and RSLinx Classic services were disabled, so I set them to start automatically. Now, everything is functioning as it should. Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I am seeking assistance with an error message that appears when I try to open FactoryTalk View Studio. The message states that the software requires personalized information that cannot be accessed. I have tried launching FactoryTalk View Studio from the Rockwell Software folder in the Program folder on my Windows 7 32-bit operating system running FactoryTalk version 6.1. However, a different error message appears stating, "Cannot connect to addin objectName: View Studio SLHMI Project HandlerCause: 80042089." Does anyone have a solution for this issue that does not involve uninstalling the software?</p>

            <p>shoelesscraig shared his experience with Factory Talk View ME software on his two PCs at the plant. He uses a single concurrent license, meaning he can only use the software on one PC at a time. Recently, he encountered an issue where the program would not start on one of the PCs, displaying an error message requesting personalized information. Despite having the activation on that PC, the software worked fine on the other PC. He tried reinstalling the software without success and may need to involve corporate IT to contact Rockwell Support. Before taking that step, he is seeking suggestions from the community. One possible solution is to navigate to C:\ProgramData\Rockwell Automation\FactoryTalk Activation and delete the .rnl files before restarting FTV/FTC.</p>

After restarting FTV/FTC, the problem was resolved for koottz. However, confusion remains about the purpose of the .rnl file, especially after noticing its outdated timestamp coinciding with the system time on the PC running FTV. Can anyone shed light on the significance of the .rnl file?</p>

            <p>Bob O inquired about whether IT has installed security patches on the computer, specifically referencing MS05-51-KB902400. As per Rockwell Automation's Knowledge Base (KB), there are various potential reasons for the issue at hand. The KB article provides further details, but access may be limited to those with a tech contract. To address the issue, is it necessary to uninstall the MS Security Patches? Attempting to remove the security patch via the Add/Remove Programs feature resulted in a warning about potential program malfunctions. Can someone provide more information on this matter? Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with RSlinx activation, try holding down shift and ctrl when starting the program. Rebooting the computer and deleting .rnl files may not solve the problem. Make sure the server is functioning properly and try activating RSlinx on a separate computer if needed.

            <p>Prezados amigos, para solucionar este problema, basta reconfigurar o nome da máquina, reiniciá-la, recriar o diretório, reiniciar novamente, retirar a conexão de rede se estiver conectada, reiniciar mais uma vez, em seguida, reconectar à rede e reiniciar. Após seguir esses passos, inicie novamente o FactoryTalk para garantir que tudo funcione corretamente. Um abraço.</p>

            <p>If you're facing an error stating "This software requires personalized information that cannot be read" when trying to open Factory Talk View, then you may need to contact Rockwell Support for assistance. One possible solution that has worked for others is to navigate to C:\ProgramData\Rockwell Automation\FactoryTalk Activation and remove the .rnl files before restarting ftv/ftc. However, this solution may not work for everyone, as it didn't resolve the issue for some users. If your Factory Talk View was previously functioning properly but suddenly stopped working, it is crucial to address this error promptly to resume normal operations.</p>

            <p>After experiencing an issue where Factory Talk View suddenly stopped working, displaying an error message requesting personalized information, I sought a solution to resolve the error. Despite the initial troubleshooting steps proving unsuccessful, I turned to a recommendation from a Rockwell Automation ticket to modify the shortcuts in the program directory. By adjusting the shortcuts to launch VStudio.exe instead of Launcher.exe, I was able to successfully resolve the issue. Simply go to the directory C:\Program Files\Common Files\Rockwell or C:\Program Files(x86)\Rockwell Software\RSView Enterprise for 64-bit systems, right-click on VStudio.exe, and create a shortcut on your desktop for easy access. This adjustment enabled me to overcome the error and resume using Factory Talk View without any further issues.</p>

            <p>After encountering a different error following my previous attempt at a solution, I delved further into the RA knowledgebase and discovered a new approach that ultimately resolved the issue. To implement this solution, follow these steps: 

1. Begin by navigating to Start --> All Programs --> CodeMeter --> CodeMeter Control Center. Right-click on the Control Center and select "Run as administrator."
2. In the Control Center, go to Process --> Stop CodeMeter Service.
3. Delete all files within the directory C:\ProgramData\CodeMeter\CmAct (there should only be two files present).
4. Return to the CodeMeter Control Center and select Process --> Start CodeMeter Service.
5. Next, select File --> Import License... and browse to C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockwell Software\FactoryTalk Activation\Tools\. Choose the UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU file and click Import.

Please note that I do not have extensive knowledge of the specific functions of the files involved, so proceed with caution when deleting or modifying them. Best of luck with resolving the issue.

            <p>In a follow-up to the previously mentioned solution, Vlad Romanov encountered a different error before finding a resolution. After delving deeper into the Rockwell Automation (RA) knowledgebase, he discovered the following steps that ultimately resolved the issue:

To resolve the error:
- Go to Start, then navigate to All Programs and select CodeMeter > CodeMeter Control Center. Right-click and choose to run as administrator.
- Under Process, select Stop CodeMeter Service.
- Delete all files in the directory C:\ProgramData\CodeMeter\CmAct (typically containing only two files).
- Return to the CodeMeter Control Center and select Start CodeMeter Service under Process.
- Import the license by selecting File > Import License... and browsing to C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockwell Software\FactoryTalk Activation\Tools. Choose the UpdateProtectionOnlyLicense.WibuCmRaU file and click Import.

It is important to note that the functionality of the deleted files is not fully understood, so proceed with caution.

These steps were successful for Vlad and potentially could work for others facing similar issues. Feel free to try these suggestions and good luck!</p>

            <p>Encountering problems after installing Adobe DC at a customer site, I removed the software but the issue persisted. To resolve it, I deleted the RNL files at C:\ProgramData\Rockwell Automation\FactoryTalk Activation as detailed in tech note 33255 from Rockwell Automation's website. Additionally, I installed patch 471166, rebooted, deleted the RNL file, rebooted again, and successfully resolved the issue. This step-by-step troubleshooting process helped me get back to business efficiently.</p>

            <p>Encountered a similar problem with deleting .rnl files, but was unable to resolve it on my own. Ultimately had to reach out to Rockwell for assistance. The solution involved resetting Registry keys. If you're still experiencing issues with .rnl files, follow these steps: 1. Open the start menu and type "regedit" to access the Registry Editor. 2. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rockwell Software. 3. Delete both "RSLogix 500 English" and "RSLogix500" keys. After restarting the software, the problem should be resolved.</p>

            <p>One user, aqibm, shared their experience of encountering the same issue and how they resolved it by contacting Rockwell for assistance. If deleting .rnl files did not work for you, resetting Registry keys may be the solution you need. Here are the steps to follow: Begin by typing "regedit" in the start menu and open the program. Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rockwell Software and delete both "RSLogix 500 English" and "RSLogix500." Restart the software and the issue should be resolved.

I recently encountered a similar issue after installing and activating v32, which involved a lengthy installation process. I observed some uninstalling and re-installing during the installation, which may have caused the problem. Despite not finding any rnl files in the specified folder, I noticed multiple files in my codemeter. I am planning to attempt the registry edit solution to see if it resolves my issue.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Unfortunately, the attempt to fix the issue through regedit was unsuccessful, prompting me to seek assistance from Rockwell. After extensive investigation, it was discovered that a glitch occurred in my FactoryTalk Services Platform application during the upgrade to v32 of Studio. This glitch prevented certain services necessary for FTView Studio from being properly installed. The root of the problem stemmed from an error (code 3010) in the x86 version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable, a component used in the installation of FT Services Platform. Ultimately, the solution involved completely uninstalling and then reinstalling FT Services Platform, which resolved the issue. I hope this information proves helpful to someone facing a similar challenge in the future.</p>
