                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I possess an AB 1769 L18ER PLC connected to our plant network through a NAT device RAM 6021. Recently, the connection to our Ignition SCADA system has been experiencing disruptions. The device's connection status would frequently switch from connected to Idle, causing the tags to become unreadable. Despite still being able to locate it on RSLinx and attempt to access the controller online, I was unable to connect using its NAT'd IP address. This issue persisted until I relocated the PLC and NAT device to a different building with a matching VLAN, where everything functioned properly. It appears that the problem lies in the network connection at the original location.

I am curious about the root cause of this sudden occurrence and how to address it with our IT team, who are unfamiliar with PLCs and automation. Your insights and guidance on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Alex</p>
