            <p>Hello Ahmad, it is important to clarify that redundancy is not simply a maintenance strategy, but rather an engineering and design strategy. I do not agree with the notion that "no condition monitoring is needed for redundant systems." The industry standard indicates that the decision to conduct condition monitoring should be based on the criticality of the equipment, regardless of whether it has redundancy. Your company should create a risk matrix, similar to the one shown in slide 5, to assess the consequence ranking and likelihood grouping of each equipment. By using this risk matrix, you can prioritize equipment by their level of risk, from highest (red) to lowest (green). Equipment with redundancy will generally have a lower probability of failure, leading to lower consequences. Therefore, equipment with lower risk may not require the same level of preventative maintenance as those at higher risk and can be managed through "breakdown" maintenance. Best regards, JVB - Chief Reliability Engineer.</p>
