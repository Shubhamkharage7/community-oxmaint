                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have recently made updates and need to remotely download a new runtime file onto a customer's PanelView Plus. The device can only store one application at a time, so we intended to use the 'Download as' option to overwrite the current file, a method that has been successful in the past. However, the download process has failed this time and now the PanelView Plus is not accepting any new downloads. It seems that the old file may still be in the system's memory but is not visible in the Transfer Utility. What steps should I take to resolve this issue? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>If you're having trouble deleting a file on your HMI screen, try accessing the configuration menu and navigating to terminal settings for file management. If that doesn't work, consider updating the HMI firmware to resolve the issue.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>ASF suggested attempting to delete the file directly from the HMI interface. Access the configuration menu, navigate to terminal settings, and locate the file management option. If these steps are unclear, consider flashing the HMI firmware to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, I am managing this remotely during the customer's nighttime hours and may not have access to the physical hardware until their morning.</p>

            <p>SteveBee mentioned that he is currently working remotely during nighttime at the customer's location, aiming to complete the task before their morning. Unfortunately, access to the physical hardware is not available. In this case, the next step would be to reflash the firmware.</p>
