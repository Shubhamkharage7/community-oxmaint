                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings,

I am currently facing an issue with connecting my M258 PLC (firmware: 2.0.31.40) using Somachine v4.3 software. The target PLC is indicating a different version, prompting me to upgrade the firmware to 4.0.3.6. However, I am unable to select the firmware versions as they are not displaying in the controller assistant. Despite searching online, I have been unable to find the necessary firmware file.

I am seeking assistance in resolving why the firmware version is not visible in the controller assistant and also in obtaining the firmware file for the M258 PLC.

Please refer to the attached photo for further clarification. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Riyas Mohamed inquired:Hello everyone, I have a M258 PLC (firmware: 2.0.31.40) and I am using Somachine v4.3 software. I am facing issues connecting my PLC as it is showing that the target PLC is a different version. Therefore, I need to update the firmware of my PLC to 4.0.3.6. I have tried updating the firmware, but I am unable to select the firmware versions as they are not displayed in the controller assistant. Additionally, I have searched online for the firmware file but have been unsuccessful in finding any. Can someone please provide a solution as to why the firmware version is not appearing in the controller assistant? Kindly share the M258 firmware file with me? Photo attached for reference.</p>
