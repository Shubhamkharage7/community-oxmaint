                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently experiencing issues with two Watlow controllers that are connected to J-type thermocouples on a sealing equipment. The temperature readings on the Watlow controllers are fluctuating between 129°F and 450°F, while the setpoint is 340°F. I suspect this may be due to transient issues with the thermocouple feedback. I have already inspected the grounding and power cables, which appear to be in good condition, and have made sure there are no power cables in close proximity to the thermocouple wires. Despite these checks, the temperature continues to fluctuate. Are there any other troubleshooting methods that could be used to address this issue? Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

            <p>If you use a multimeter to check the signals of the thermocouples, do they appear to be fluctuating? It appears that there may be a configuration issue with the Watlow controllers - are these the same controllers discussed in a previous thread? This situation with Watlow controllers is proving to be quite challenging. Good evening, gentlemen. Upon joining this project, I discovered that a cold room had been converted into a hot room. Everything was running smoothly until about a month ago when the temperature started exceeding the set value, triggering an alarm. While I couldn't locate the schematics, I did notice the presence of a thermocouple in the system.</p>

            <p>Have you observed the signals of the thermocouples using a multi meter? It appears that the Watlow controllers may be experiencing a configuration issue. Are these the same controllers mentioned in your previous post? Dealing with Watlow controllers can be quite tricky.

Good Evening, gentlemen. I came across a problem with a converted hot room that was previously a cold room at my workplace. Recently, the temperature started exceeding the set value, triggering an alarm. While I couldn't locate the schematics, I did notice the presence of a thermocouple.

Thank you for your response. This situation involves a different controller. The pouching equipment in question is equipped with two heaters controlled by Watlow temperature controllers. One of the controllers had a calibration offset issue which led us to replace it with a new one. However, the thermocouple signals are now fluctuating when tested with a multimeter using the new controller, while they remain stable with the old controller.

Interestingly, using the new controller causes both controllers to show fluctuating readings. Although I do not have access to the schematics, it appears that the two controllers may be interconnected, potentially due to a configuration error. I am uncertain about the steps to take in order to rectify this issue.</p>

            <p>It is common for controllers to require an isolated, ungrounded thermocouple when connected to electrically heated components in order to avoid electrical noise interfering with the controller's operation. It is important to determine if the thermocouples being used are sheathed thermocouples, as exposed hot junctions can lead to a lack of isolation. Testing for continuity between the sheath and the thermocouple leadwires can help determine if the thermocouple is grounded or isolated.</p>

            <p>danw mentioned that most controllers require an isolated, ungrounded thermocouple when connected to electrically heated components to avoid interference from electrical noise. If the thermocouples are sheathed, exposed hot junctions may not be fully isolated. Testing for continuity between the sheath and thermocouple leadwire can determine if the thermocouple is grounded. It was confirmed that the thermocouples in question are indeed sheathed, with continuity between the terminals and outer sheath. The next consideration would be whether it is advisable to remove the sheath near the hot-cold junction of the thermocouple to ensure proper isolation.</p>

            <p>bdauliya inquired about sheathed thermocouples, expressing concern about continuity between the thermocouple terminals and the outer sheath. They questioned whether it would be advisable to remove the sheath near the hot-cold junction of the thermocouple. However, it is recommended to opt for an ungrounded thermocouple designed in a way that prevents the hot junction from touching the sheath. These thermocouples are insulated with white MgO powder packing to electrically isolate the junction. While ungrounded thermocouples may cost around $3 more than grounded ones, they offer benefits such as electrical isolation and preventing potential issues related to electric heat. The response time may be slower due to the heat having to transfer through the MgO packing instead of a conductive path from the sheath to the junction.</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with a once-working system, it could be due to a poor connection. Consider cleaning or replacing small two blade connectors to ensure a secure fit. Tighten screws and connectors to prevent potential issues. Be mindful of cables that flex with machine motion, as they may break internally over time. It's crucial to use the correct materials for components that form the electrical path between the controller and sensor, based on the type of sensor being used. In certain situations, there may be exceptions to this rule.</p>
