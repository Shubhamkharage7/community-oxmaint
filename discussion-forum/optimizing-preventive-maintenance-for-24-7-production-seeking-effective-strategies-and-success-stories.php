            <p>If you have a history of identifying failing components during maintenance inspections that could have led to catastrophic events, these inspections can be considered value-added. Do you have historical data that specifies the failures found, when they were discovered, and the impact of preventing potential catastrophic events? This data will support the importance of conducting these critical inspections, even if they require production outages.

Reviewing your maintenance strategies using reliability and risk-based engineering methods may be necessary based on your historical data. If your history justifies shutting down production for critical inspections, management may support reallocating resources for further analysis of maintenance strategies. Implementing strategies like RCM, spare parts management, and equipment redesign can improve maintenance efficiency and prevent potential failures.

Consider the impact of balancing equipment maintenance needs and production schedules, especially in a 24/7 operation where nighttime maintenance can be more costly. Scheduling planned outages during regular work hours when possible can help optimize resources and minimize costs. This approach may differ for facilities with shorter operating hours, where maintenance is typically conducted during shutdown periods.</p>

            <p>Hello, it's important not to underestimate the value of conducting thorough walkarounds. Often, tasks that may seem unproductive actually yield more benefits than initially thought. The key lies in the way these tasks are performed. As a former CM tech who frequently conducted walkarounds, I discovered issues that operators or production personnel may have overlooked. This could be due to a lack of understanding, a reluctance to address problems, or simply not caring. In addition to identifying these issues, taking a wider perspective proved to be beneficial, as it allowed me to connect the dots between various aspects of maintenance. As an advocate for TPM, I recommend incorporating visual controls to streamline inspection processes. By utilizing visual aids such as marked gauges, temperature-sensitive tape, transparent guards, and oil level indicators, you can optimize your walkaround route, especially in a large facility. If you're new to TPM methods for autonomous inspection, I encourage you to seek out resources to enhance your understanding. Best of luck on your maintenance journey. Regards, Mike.</p>

            <p>When it comes to manufacturing facilities, it is common to experience downtime for set-up changes and retooling, which are essential for product or production-related processes. By aligning preventive maintenance (PM) work with these downtimes, facilities can effectively schedule and prioritize maintenance tasks. Additionally, recording downtime caused by breakdowns can help justify the need for PM work to prevent future breakdowns. If equipment failures are primarily a result of wear, fatigue, or corrosion, implementing PM strategies is essential. However, if breakdowns are often classified as 'no fault found,' it may be challenging to justify PM activities. Ultimately, it is important to consider overall downtime, including both PM and breakdown maintenance (BM), to ensure efficient and effective maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>When determining the best maintenance program for your facility, it is important to align it with your company's business goals. A successful program should target specific equipment needs based on factors such as criticality to the operation. Implementing a Predictive Maintenance (PM) program utilizing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles can help to ensure that your equipment is properly maintained to prevent failures.

The key to a successful PM program lies in targeting equipment that requires attention, specific tasks to predict, prevent, or detect equipment conditions, and ways to correct failure modes. Using handheld technology to gather data and monitor the effectiveness of the program is essential for success.

Regularly reviewing and adjusting the PM program, known as Dynamic PMs, based on equipment performance metrics like Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time Between Repairs (MTBR) is crucial. This helps in extending the life of equipment and identifying areas for improvement.

Ultimately, the goal is to capture work history for each piece of equipment and ensure that maintenance tasks are being carried out effectively by all trades involved. By focusing on these key elements and actively implementing the plan, you can ensure that your maintenance program is not just a paperwork exercise but a proactive strategy for equipment reliability.</p>

            <p>quote: As manufacturing facilities often require setup changes and retooling, known as product or production related downtimes, it is advantageous to coordinate preventive maintenance (PM) work with these downtimes. By aligning PM schedules with production downtimes, maintenance tasks can be efficiently completed without disrupting production. Communication and coordination with production planning and supervisors are essential to identify optimal time windows for PM work in each production area/line. It is recommended to schedule all PM orders for a specific area/line during a designated downtime, moving on to the next area once that work is completed. This approach helps avoid conflicts in maintenance crew capacity and ensures that only one production area/line is offline at a time. This strategy maximizes efficiency and minimizes production disruptions.</p>

It is common for management to not focus on the specifics of the PM program, but rather on the results it delivers. The Maintenance Manager is responsible for implementing a maintenance program that drives business success, whether it includes RCM, PMs, PdMs, CMs, etc. The question remains: when should maintenance be conducted for a 24/7 operation?

I am unsure why knowledge of the PM program's content is necessary to address the question regarding its scheduling. Vee, your guidance is appreciated. The question you posed cannot be simply answered without a deeper understanding of the mill/plant/process in question. Effective PM scheduling should be aligned with business objectives, equipment Weibull life expectancy through PdM, past PM performance, and reliability metrics like MTBF and MTTF. Further information is needed to provide a more detailed response. Remember, the original question was: quote: Originally shared by igolfat8: How can a meaningful PM program be implemented?

            <p>Quote: When scheduling preventive maintenance (PM) tasks, it is important to consider factors such as business goals, equipment longevity using predictive maintenance (PdM), past PM history, and metrics like MTBF and MTTF. Once a PM plan has been developed, including tasks identified through reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) or other analysis, establishing frequencies, estimating completion times, and planning necessary resources, the next step is to coordinate with Maintenance and Operations to agree on a start date and time for the job. For example, if a piece of equipment requires quarterly PM tasks scheduled for February, May, August, and November, the scheduling process involves reaching an agreement with Operations in January for Maintenance to access the equipment sometime between February 1 and February 28.</p>

            <p>James, in the midst of analyzing your point, let's delve deeper into the discussion, as addressed by Darth and Steven. "Scheduling preventive maintenance (PM)" should be strategically aligned with business objectives, the life expectancy of equipment using predictive maintenance (PdM), past PM records, and factors like MTBF and MTTF. This complex process requires thorough information for an accurate determination. While it is indeed crucial that "Scheduling PM's should be based on the business goals," other aspects require consideration. 

1. Planning the necessary tasks, their timelines, and procedures is primarily a planning function. 
2. Metrics such as MTBF and MTTF assist in determining the plan, such as PdM or PM content. 
3. Weibull parameters and MTTF are calculated through statistical analysis to estimate the likelihood of failure within a specified timeframe, not the exact time of failure. PdM, on the other hand, predicts the time to functional failure based on the physical deterioration that has already started, offering a more reliable estimate. These figures aid in work planning, influencing decisions like the frequency of PdM checks or the timing of PM tasks. For instance, if a PdM check forecasts a potential functional failure time, corrective maintenance (CM) can be initiated promptly. Deciding when to execute CM is a scheduling decision influenced by the business impact of the failure.
4. Scheduling involves an economic evaluation to pinpoint the exact commencement time, ensuring that resources and logistics are in place for swift completion of the job.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all the responses received so far. I apologize for my delayed participation as I have been focused on addressing urgent fire-fighting issues. Despite our success as a Fortune 100 company, we acknowledge the ongoing need to combat unexpected challenges. Here's a bit of background: Our manufacturing plant, one of many across the US and globally, employs over 3500 workers. We prioritize maintenance excellence, supported by our proactive strategies such as an active TPM program, Opex, limited RCM, in-house PdM staff, advanced WPA lab for oil sample analysis, skilled maintenance personnel, and dedicated Tooling departments. Our comprehensive PM program includes various tiers like basic operator visual PM tasks, skilled maintenance walk-around inspections, monthly PdM routes, and a specialized 10-hour PM Crew for in-depth maintenance work. Our main challenge lies in finding sufficient time for hands-on PM due to continuous production demands. While PdM tools are valuable, they can't replace the effectiveness of on-site inspections. This dilemma may require additional investments in remote sensing technology and expanded PdM resources. Unlike many supporters of RCM, I have reservations due to the time-consuming nature and challenges with team engagement. Despite acknowledging the benefits of RCM, I believe there is a need for a more efficient and practical approach to the process. These are just my observations and opinions on improving our maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>When it comes to machinery, there are two options: either it must be designed to last forever, or it will eventually break down. Satellites serve as a prime example of this dilemma - once they are launched into orbit, it becomes challenging to make any necessary repairs. This begs the question: would you rather pay the high cost of repairing a satellite or invest in a new pump or press?

Even in industries like oil refineries, plants undergo scheduled turnarounds for major maintenance and inspection purposes. However, this does not mean that maintenance is neglected during normal operations. It is essential for the equipment owner to collaborate with maintenance teams for smooth equipment handover procedures to prevent last-minute emergencies. Murphy's Law dictates that emergency breakdowns always seem to occur on Friday evenings, right before the close of business. Maintenance teams are not keen on working overtime during weekends, so proper maintenance planning and procedures are crucial for avoiding such scenarios.</p>

            <p>If you are facing challenges in maintaining your manufacturing equipment, you are not alone. Many companies struggle with similar issues. One common issue is the lack of time for hands-on preventive maintenance due to the prioritization of "fire fighting." Despite having programs like TPM and Opex in place, finding a window for thorough maintenance remains a challenge.

A key factor contributing to this challenge is the lack of buy-in from production teams. Production may not see the value in intrusive maintenance practices that often lead to extended downtimes and decreased machine performance. This disconnect between maintenance and production can result in breakdowns and reduced overall equipment effectiveness.

To address this issue, companies must evaluate their maintenance programs through methods like Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM). By identifying and eliminating unnecessary tasks, optimizing preventive maintenance intervals, and involving operations in reliability engineering, companies can improve machine availability and overall plant performance.

If you are interested in learning more about how to optimize your maintenance program and enhance equipment reliability, feel free to reach out for a personalized presentation. It's time to shift from reactive maintenance to a proactive reliability assurance program that ensures optimal equipment performance. Let's work together to improve maintenance practices and drive operational excellence.</p>

            <p>Josh, The figures I have presented have not been published in this specific format. However, the plant production figures are publicly available for verification. This research was conducted approximately four years ago. I have additional case studies available, including one that demonstrated a more recent 15% improvement in less than six months for a company specializing in food product manufacturing. The featured company in the case study significantly increased profitability with a 30% rise in production rates. It is important to note that this increase in profitability is largely attributed to the substantial investment in plant upgrades. As demonstrated, in plants like these, overall performance is impacted by the equipment with the lowest output capacity. In this particular case, maintenance in this area was found to be the key factor affecting business operations. Implementing the wrong maintenance strategy can lead to setbacks, while adopting a reliable approach can drive positive results. - Steve</p>
