                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you have a three-phase induction motor drive with an inverter that utilizes a braking resistor during the braking phase. While the motor acts as a generator, the electrical power generated is dissipated through the braking resistor controlled by a chopper. To protect the braking resistor from overheating, I am looking to implement software-based thermal protection. One challenge is the absence of a temperature sensor on the resistor, necessitating the need to estimate its temperature. My initial approach involves using the measured dc link voltage and current through the resistor to calculate its resistance using Ohm's law. By understanding the temperature dependence of resistance, I can then estimate the resistor's temperature. However, initial experiments using this method have resulted in unreliable resistance values, even after attempting to filter them with a low pass filter. Any suggestions on how to improve the reliability of resistance values using this method?</p>

            <p>When considering the best approach for managing brake resistance in a drive, opting for a temperature switch may prove to be a more reliable and simpler solution compared to calculating it manually. An alternative option would be using a temperature sensor with an analog output to track the temperature fluctuations over time. For example, when working with an Allen-Bradley PowerFlex 525 drive, software is available to assist in selecting the appropriate resistor based on the expected duty cycle. By inputting the resistor information into the drive, it can then utilize internal algorithms to safeguard the resistor.

While calculating the dissipated watts for the brake resistor may seem complex, it can be simplified by using the formula I^2 x R. It is important to refer to the brake resistor specifications for details on dissipated power, including duty cycle and wattage. Although obtaining synchronized samples of brake current and DC Bus voltage may be challenging and may not yield accurate results due to the constant nature of resistor resistance. However, the resistance of a resistor remains unchanged over time.</p>

            <p>One potential solution could be a circuit breaker that can handle the thermal load averaging. Adding an auxiliary contact to disable the VFD in case of the breaker tripping might also be beneficial for optimal control of the system.</p>
