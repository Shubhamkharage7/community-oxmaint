                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Larry, you mentioned one of the key objectives of implementing PMOs is to extend the PM cycle from 12 to 18 months. Similarly, at KNPP, we are looking at extending the plant turnaround interval from 12 to 18 months, aligning with the 12-month certificate of fitness for pressure vessels and boilers approved by DOSH, which can be extended for another 6 months. Despite this extension, we have not observed any significant changes in corrective maintenance. We had hoped to see a reduction in breakdown maintenance following the PMO exercise. It is encouraging to note that the RCM Manager has now been established as a staff position, signifying the growing importance of reliability within the organization. Some believe that reliability should be integrated into every staff member's job description, making it a collective responsibility. What exactly does the job description of the RCM Manager entail at KNPP? If you have overlooked or been occupied, I have reposted my question on the following link: [link].</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Josh, after revisiting my paper from the SMRP conference, I, like you, was surprised by the lack of change in corrective maintenance despite a significant decrease in preventive maintenance activities. One would expect a reduction in the number of preventive maintenance tasks to result in a proportional decrease in corrective maintenance, as less equipment would be prone to failures. Fortunately, I still have access to the original data used in the paper, which provided some insights. 

During the initial PM optimization project, we eliminated 686 PM tasks and introduced 109 new ones. Additionally, we removed 80 equipment items from the PM program and reclassified them as Run-To-Failure. This shift resulted in an increase in corrective work orders, as noted in the reliability manager's report. 

The fact that some equipment items were later added back to the PM program due to failures or other reasons suggests that the overall number of corrective work orders remained constant. This could be attributed to a decrease in infant mortality failures, indicating less frequent intrusive maintenance.

Moving on to your second question about the role of a Reliability Manager, it is crucial for all engineering, operations, and maintenance personnel to have a solid understanding of equipment reliability. Companies are now implementing strict guidelines, such as requiring documentation of the equipment's failure mechanism and justification for any changes based on RCM principles. 

Traditionally, maintenance responsibilities were divided among departments, but a reliability program aims to integrate these functions. RCM analysis helps create a well-balanced equipment strategy focused on preventing failures with minimal resources. Communication between departments is key to maintaining equipment effectively, as even minor changes to PM activities can impact the overall strategy. To ensure controlled changes to the PM program, all requests must go through the Reliability Manager for evaluation and approval.

            <p>In the realm of workplace safety, a Reliability Manager plays a crucial role similar to that of a Safety Manager. Just as a Safety Manager fosters a safety culture by training and assisting line managers, a Reliability Manager promotes reliability within the organization. They serve as a vital link between line managers and top management, offering expert advice upon request, and representing the company with external bodies such as regulators. Larry, your insightful analysis is greatly appreciated and aligns well with our objectives. It is unfortunate that the audit trail is unclear, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact correlation to our optimization efforts. However, your deductions are logical and sound.</p>

            <p>Returning to the initial question, I observed an increase in the number of maintenance requests despite the improvement in equipment reliability following the implementation of a comprehensive reliability program. Plant personnel became actively involved in the program, realizing how it directly benefitted them. They began submitting work requests for long-standing issues that had been temporarily fixed and overdue for repairs, as well as for routine maintenance tasks that were previously unrecorded. This led to a perception of increased corrective work being done, when in reality, it was due to better documentation of existing work and the ability of maintenance crews to focus on non-emergency tasks. Unfortunately, I lack current data to support this observation, as I am no longer employed at the plant. Richard.</p>

            <p>When using a dynamic CMMS system, it is important to take statistics with a grain of salt. Work orders can often be misleading, especially as work types are added or removed over time. The addition or removal of work types can impact the statistics, causing changes as the system is redesigned. This means that work orders initially categorized as CMs may be reclassified as a different work type later on, and vice versa. It is important to be mindful of these potential changes when analyzing data in a dynamic CMMS system.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the issue of defining corrective maintenance (CM) and breakdowns adds a layer of complexity. CMs can stem from various sources: inspections, rework following a preventive maintenance (PM) task, or analysis results from condition-based maintenance (CBM). In all these scenarios, there is an imminent risk of functional failure, with the physical deterioration already underway. Some argue that CBM activities should be excluded when calculating mean time between failures (MTBF) since they are typically planned in advance. However, I disagree with this perspective. While CBM can prevent premature functional failure and mitigate the impact of failures, the equipment degradation process is already underway (beyond the 'P' point in the P-F curve). This leads to a common challenge of comparing apples to pears. It is important to acknowledge such discrepancies while analyzing trends, but they may not significantly affect the overall assessment. Consistency in definitions and avoiding mid-stream changes is key.</p>

            <p>Work orders can often be confusing, as work types are frequently added and removed over time. It is important to properly manage and document any changes in work types to ensure accurate analysis. By following the basic work types outlined in John Micchell's Physical Asset Management book or SMP's published list, you can stay on track with overall trends. For more information, you can refer to Terry or the CMRP exam syllabus. Once your CMMS stabilizes, any discrepancies in work orders will be resolved.</p>

            <p>In the discussion above, it is acknowledged that Corrective Maintenance (CM) can be triggered by various factors such as inspections, rework after a Preventive Maintenance (PM), and Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) analysis results, all indicating an imminent functional failure. Some may argue that CBM falls under planned maintenance as it is scheduled in advance, excluding it from Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) calculations. However, the degradation process is already underway. In our scenario, we classify item 3 as Corrective/Preventive (CP) work stemming from PM activities. We differentiate between Planned Preventive Maintenance (PPM) and CP work in our Preventive Maintenance (PM) system. Rework after a PM is manually tracked in our system due to ambiguity surrounding whether it is truly rework or new issues unrelated to the initial maintenance. In defining rework, we consider any repetitive maintenance tasks within a 3-month window, including rectifying errors that should have been addressed initially. To quantify rework, we analyze work orders based on equipment tags, work types, and activities, with final approval from the relevant maintenance personnel. How do you define rework in your operations? Share your approach to managing and measuring rework in maintenance processes.</p>

            <p>Larry, I have one more question about your comparison between PMO and RCM. What evidence supports your conclusion that PMO yields similar outcomes to RCM? Is it due to the fact that some PM practices were derived from RCM, or did you unknowingly integrate elements of the RCM process into your PM review? Please provide additional clarification.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>For our initial analysis, we selected a system that had undergone RCM analysis but had not been put into action. The purpose was to conduct a comparative study between the two methodologies to validate the PM optimization process. Upon completion of the pilot study, we reviewed the final recommendations for the equipment analyzed in both the PMO and RCM projects. Despite some minor differences, the outcomes were largely consistent.

It is worth noting that the RCM project yielded more final recommendations for equipment items compared to the PMO process. The main goal of the PMO process was to enhance the PM strategies for equipment within the existing program. Following the PMO, the next phase of the reliability program will utilize a more conventional RCM approach to assess the remaining equipment outliers.

Regarding the actual PM optimization process, I have integrated various elements from traditional RCM methods. In summary, the process involves breaking down a PM task into its individual steps, identifying the equipment's function and potential failure consequences, and determining if the consequences warrant the assigned PM task. If necessary, the task is subjected to a Logic Tree Analysis for potential revision or replacement.

On the other hand, if the failure consequences are not deemed critical, the task undergoes a Non-critical evaluation involving six key questions to assess the need for its retention in the program. Additionally, practical judgment plays a role in the PM Optimization process, where equipment that deviates from the norm may be added to the program for optimization, even if it falls outside the initial project scope.</p>

            <p>In discussions about post-PM work, there is often debate about whether it should be classified as rework or something else. In my opinion, the default stance should be that any corrective maintenance (CM) required shortly after a preventive maintenance (PM) is indeed rework. The burden of proving otherwise lies on the team responsible for the initial PM. My rationale for labeling it as rework includes the possibility of tasks being overlooked or performed incorrectly, incorrect start-up or shutdown procedures, incorrect parts installation, and subpar work quality. Conducting a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) can help identify the underlying issues and drive systemic improvements. By categorizing the CM as rework, it can prompt the RCA process, leading to long-term reliability enhancements. It is important to note that human error is inevitable and not a punishable offense. Instead of assigning blame, it is more effective to help individuals understand their mistakes to prevent recurrence. Involving the workers responsible for the PM in the RCA process can result in valuable insights and foster a culture of continuous improvement.</p>

            <p>In project management, the burden of proof lies on the individual or team carrying out the original project. While this concept is widely accepted, there is a common tendency to penalize errors even if they are accidental. In the event that the project manager denies that a task is a rework, the decision falls upon higher-ups such as the Plant Manager, General Manager, or CEO. It is beneficial if consensus is reached within the organization to determine if a task qualifies as a rework, allowing for peer pressure to come into play.</p>

He also raised the issue of determining what constitutes rework and suggested peer pressure as a possible influencing factor.
