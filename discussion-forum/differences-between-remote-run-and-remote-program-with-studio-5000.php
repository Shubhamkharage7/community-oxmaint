            <p>There are two modes on the controller: Run and Program. In Run mode, the program is actively running, while in Program mode, the program is not running. The term "Remote" refers to the key switch's center position. When the key switch is in the Remote position, the PLC can be switched between Run and Program mode using Logix Designer. If the key switch is in the Run or Program position, it is locked in that mode and cannot be altered through the software.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In response to MattMatt9's query about changing the program from their station, the answer is yes. Switching to "remote program" means that the software can make changes remotely. The functionality remains the same whether the key switch or software is used to put the PLC in Program mode. The key switch activates Program mode, while the software activates Remote Program mode.</p>

            <p>MattMatt9 asked if there is ever a specific reason for a PLC to be in program mode during commissioning. The answer is yes, especially when downloading new changes. For example, when I recently accessed a technician's computer remotely to make adjustments that required a download, I put the PLC in program mode to prevent any unintended machine starts while I prepared the program. This is a common practice to enhance troubleshooting skills on our ship.</p>

            <p>When programming a CPU on the workbench, I always ensure to set the key to "Program" mode. This ensures that when the CPU is placed back in its designated rack and powered on, it will not accidentally run any programs that could have detrimental effects. This precaution is crucial for preventing potential disasters.</p>

            <p>To enable program downloads, the key switch on the remote must be switched to program mode. In run mode, your workstation can go online but downloading a new program is not possible. However, you can still make online code changes with the key switch in this setting.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the software, the key switch on the remote is crucial for toggling to program mode during the download process. While in run mode, your workstation can connect online but will be unable to download new programs. However, you should still be able to make online code edits even if the key switch is in run. It is doubtful that online edits can be made in run mode.</p>

            <p>According to plvlce, making online edits may not be possible if the keyswitch is in run mode. Based on my own experience, you need to be in Remote Run mode at least to Test and Assemble the edits, instead of just accepting them in Program/Remote Program mode.</p>

            <p>When it comes to key switches, it's important to consider who has access to make program changes. At a water utility I used to work for, we had issues with laptops from Rockwell causing stations to drop offline. To prevent this, only electricians and select supervisors were allowed to use keys to make changes. We initially kept every processor in "run" mode with keys removed to ensure only authorized personnel could access them. This worked for a while until more keys began to surface, leading to unauthorized access by individuals who didn't have programming skills. It became a challenge to limit access to only those who truly needed it, such as telemetry and SCADA departments. It's crucial to maintain strict control over who can make program changes to prevent mishaps and system failures.</p>
