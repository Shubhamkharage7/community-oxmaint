                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I have a lingering question regarding the calculation of system availability in the context of an underground mine with multiple ore handling systems. Specifically, I am looking into how to factor in the presence of buffers in the overall availability assessment. The mine has two main systems and an auxiliary system that hoist ore up through a central shaft. 

There are two methods we use to calculate availability: one involves using data on breakdowns, operations, idling, and preventive maintenance hours over a set period to determine availability. The other method considers Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). 

For example, if we have 10 pieces of equipment in one of the systems (such as bins, conveyors, crushers), and we treat it as a series system where the failure of one component can halt production, the overall availability is the product of each equipment's availability. 

However, I am unsure about how to account for equipment like bins or ore passes that have capacity buffers. Even if the lower conveyor fails, the bin several levels above can still receive ore and remain operational. Should I exclude these buffers and focus solely on the mechanical equipment for availability calculations? While the bins and other components do undergo maintenance and occasionally experience hangups, they are still considered part of the system.</p>

            <p>Hello AJ. While I'm not an expert in this area, it's important to have data for each individual capacity buffer. In order to calculate availability, you need to assign a redundancy factor to each buffer and then incorporate this into the overall formula. This formula combines parallel and series calculations using adjusted figures for each buffer. It is calculated as x1 * x2 * x3 * x4 * x5 * x6 * x7 * x8 * x9 * (time monitored - (downtime(bin1 + bin2 + bin3 + bin4 + bin5) * redundancy factor) / time monitored. This calculation assumes a uniform redundancy factor of 20% above. I hope this explanation clarifies things, but feel free to reach out if you need further assistance or information.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How can system availability be calculated in underground mines with multiple ore handling systems and buffers?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - System availability in such mines can be calculated using methods that consider breakdowns, operations, idling, preventive maintenance hours, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How does the presence of buffers impact the overall availability assessment of underground mine systems?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Buffers like bins and ore passes can complicate availability calculations as they may continue to function even if a lower-level component fails. Deciding whether to include or exclude buffers in availability calculations depends on their criticality to the overall system operation.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Should equipment like bins or ore passes with capacity buffers be included in availability calculations for underground mine systems?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While bins and other components with buffers undergo maintenance and can experience issues, they are still integral parts of the system. Deciding on their inclusion in availability calculations should consider their role in system functionality and potential impact on production.</p>
