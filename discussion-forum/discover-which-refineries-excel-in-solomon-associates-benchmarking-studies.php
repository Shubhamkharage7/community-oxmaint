            <p>Several years ago, I was responsible for organizing the participation of refineries in the Solomon studies for a global oil company. Solomon Associates (SAI) conducts these studies annually, alternating between the USA in even years and the rest of the world in odd years. Each study includes around 150-200 refineries, with the specific locations kept confidential by SAI. As a result, only SAI can provide information on the participants in each study, including details on who ranks in the top quartile or is considered a pacesetter. However, what is available is the performance data for each refinery, including metrics such as energy consumption, manpower utilization, maintenance and operating costs, and conversion efficiency.

SAI employs a normalization process in their analysis, measuring all process units in equivalent distillation capacity (EDC) to allow for comparisons between simple and complex refineries. They also make adjustments for shutdown cycles and maintenance cost allocations to ensure consistency across different accounting practices. This approach creates a level playing field for all participants in the study.</p>

            <p>In order to achieve a fair competition, companies strive to level the playing field. While working for a multinational oil company, I have come across the concept of Solomon surveys, which aim to benchmark participants. It's interesting to note that even within the same unit of a refinery, engineers may produce different survey results. This leads to questions about the standardization of responses among all participants. Furthermore, the Solomon Report explicitly advises against making organizational changes based on comparisons, as it can lead to detrimental actions like unnecessary layoffs. It serves as a reminder that blindly following benchmarks may not lead to the desired outcome. To truly achieve success, one must understand the unique qualities and strategies that have brought others to their current position. Remember, it's about the journey, not just the destination. - Kim Williams</p>

            <p>It is recommended to proceed with caution before implementing any organizational or operational changes based solely on benchmarking comparisons. While benchmarking can provide valuable insights, its validity is often limited to a specific timeframe, particularly during self-assessments. Best practices and benchmarking data, especially in the field of maintenance, can offer useful indicators. However, be wary of blindly following practices that may not be suitable for your specific situation and could potentially result in negative outcomes. It is important to carefully consider the recommendations of the Standards of Auditing Institute (SAI) before making any decisions.</p>

            <p>When it comes to benchmarking, the key is not to simply replicate, but to truly comprehend the process. Consider a scenario where Company A has made consistent improvements over the years and is now at the top of its industry. It would not be practical for Company B, which has not focused on improvements, to directly adopt Company A's current organizational structure and workforce allocation in hopes of achieving the same success. Company B must instead analyze and understand the steps taken by Company A to reach its current position. It is crucial to follow the same path, not just imitate the end result. By understanding and replicating the path taken by successful companies, we can expedite our own journey towards success. Just like in algebra class, where showing your work was essential for scoring full marks, in the business world, understanding the process is key to achieving desired outcomes. Additionally, in benchmarking studies, it's important to consider economies of scale. For instance, the operation of a 200,000 barrel-per-day crude unit may not necessarily require significantly more staff compared to a 50,000 barrel-per-day unit. In fact, a newer 200,000 bpd unit might even operate more efficiently with fewer employees. These intricate details should be carefully examined when embarking on improvement initiatives based on benchmarking. By comprehending both the successful company's system and path, as well as our own system and goals, we can chart a successful course forward using the lessons learned from others.</p>

            <p>Hello Kim, it's great to hear from you. In my opinion, SAI excels in comparison to other organizations like McKinsey when it comes to E&P installations, operating on a level playing field. SAI considers a variety of factors beyond just costs. Interestingly, I used to conduct benchmarking studies for a multinational oil company internally, analyzing 35 refineries each year. Our methodology differed from SAI's, but the top and bottom performers remained consistent across both studies. In the middle, rankings sometimes varied. SAI not only provides performance data but also highlights what distinguishes top performers, emphasizing the importance of reliability and tools like RCA and RCM to prevent failures. SAI provides clear instructions for completing input forms and conducts validations, but cheating can occur if instructions are misunderstood. Despite this, some refineries have used SAI reports to make significant improvements, resulting in better performance in subsequent benchmarks. However, some managements make hasty decisions based on benchmarking results without considering the methods used. It's essential to approach benchmarking with an open mind and not underestimate its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Kim emphasizes the importance of understanding the path to success, not just the end result. By grasping the steps taken to achieve a goal, one can expedite the process while still acknowledging essential milestones along the way. Kim highlights the necessity for management to recognize this fundamental truth, despite the prevalence of the Peter Principle in the corporate world. Many top managers may not have reached their positions if competence was a prerequisite.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by Josh: Is it possible for two individuals to provide varying results for a benchmarking survey? Could it be that they were from different divisions within the same refinery? This incident occurred quite some time ago. Both engineers were well-versed in the SAME process unit within the SAME refinery and completed their assessments independently. To the best of my recollection, the discrepancy arose from differences in interpretation between the two engineers. It seems likely that the instructions provided were not as detailed and precise as they are now. Kim Williams</p>
