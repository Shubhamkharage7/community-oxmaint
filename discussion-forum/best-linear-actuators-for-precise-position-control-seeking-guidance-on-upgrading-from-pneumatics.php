                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Currently, my linear process operates on pneumatic cylinders with a 4-20mA linear position transducer. A PLC controls these cylinders using an Enfield S2 cylinder positioning controller. However, the position control is subpar, especially under varying force/load conditions. This issue seems to stem from the limitations of using air as a positioning medium due to its compressibility and inconsistent availability, as well as the Enfield controller's inadequate algorithm lacking a full PID loop.

To improve the system, I am considering retrofitting it with ballscrews and a servo for more precise control. However, this would require significant physical modifications. Therefore, I am first seeking electric linear actuators with a form factor similar to the current cylinders. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find any that meet the speed, force, and accuracy requirements of the application. The ideal actuator should have a closing force of at least 1500lbf/6700N, be capable of full open/close movement within 2 seconds over a total travel distance of 20‚Äù/500mm, and position accurately within 1/32 inches/1mm.

While I have heard of servo hydraulics and hydraulic positioning as alternatives, I lack knowledge in this area. Can anyone provide guidance on where to start or recommend suitable products, preferably ones suitable for beginners?</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey suggested using oil for better results, emphasizing the importance of natural frequency in the system. He questioned the knowledge of others regarding the system's natural frequency, prompting a search on Google for "natural frequency PID." The search led to insights on the significance of natural frequency, particularly in relation to Delta and RMC controllers. Despite not having worked with hydraulics in years, Nachtwey's expertise in this area seems to align perfectly with the project requirements. While seeking guidance on the necessary components for controlling two cylinders, the user expressed interest in a potential sales pitch from Nachtwey. Unsure if two channels are required or if parallel plumbing is sufficient, the user is open to recommendations on the most basic yet effective solution for their application.</p>

            <p>When I requested a quote on the Delta website for the RMC75E-AA1(1)EXP70-A2, I was unsure if the expansion module was necessary. The quote wizard led me to believe it was needed to control the RMC75 with an analog signal, but the RMC75 datasheet suggests that the AA1 axis card already accepts an analog signal. I couldn't find any valves on the Delta site; what type of valves do you suggest? Would any standard 0-10V or 4-20mA proportional valve work?</p>

            <p>Indeed, that's correct. Are you referring to the speed at which it can transition between extents? The ability to accelerate or decelerate is crucial. It is noted, particularly by Google, that you have a strong focus on natural frequency. I am honored to be a member of the International Fluid Power Hall of Fame and have authored magazine articles for over two decades. I consider myself proficient in control theory and mathematics, although I respect the laws of physics. If you have mastery over pneumatics, transitioning to hydraulics should pose no major challenges, although there are limitations. 

One of the systems I utilize for testing hydraulic control algorithms is PneuMove2. Managing pneumatics can be complex due to the high level of air compression. You are welcome to explore my YouTube Channel if you have an interest in control theory. Retirement has allowed me to settle in Panama, where I now reside and spend less time on forums as I enjoy camping without internet access. 

Currently, the team at Delta Motion is expected to handle any tasks that arise. I firmly believe that we have the best solution available. Regarding a quote inquiry on the Delta website for RMC75E-AA1(1)EXP70-A2, I am uncertain if the expansion module is necessary. It appears from the RMC75 datasheet that the AA1 axis card already supports an analog signal. The EXP70 module, however, is essential for torque limiting. 

It would be advisable to acquire a main module with an SSi input for an SSI Temposonc or Balluff rod. For technical guidance, contacting Delta Motion tech support is recommended. A servo quality valve capable of flowing oil to both sides of a cylinder piston for force control is essential. The spool configuration should ensure no overlap and be linear for optimal performance. Cylinder size, such as a 2-inch diameter, also plays a significant role. If further assistance is required, Delta Motion experts can reach out for additional guidance.</p>

            <p>Absolutely. When discussing cycle speed, we're referring to how quickly it can transition between extents. The acceleration and deceleration rates are also crucial aspects to consider. 

Known for his expertise in natural frequency and control theory, this individual is a distinguished member of the International Fluid Power Hall of Fame. With a background in writing magazine articles for over two decades, his focus is on control theory and mathematical analysis within the realm of fluid power systems. 

Utilizing a test system called PneuMove2, hydraulic control algorithms are put to the test, showcasing the challenges of controlling pneumatics due to air compression. With a strong YouTube presence dedicated to control theory, this expert's retiree status and current location in Panama have led to less forum activity, as camping adventures often take him off the grid. 

While the expertise at Delta Motion is trusted to pick up the workload, the pursuit of the best solutions remains a top priority. A recent inquiry was made regarding the need for the EXP70 module to control the RMC75 with an analog signal, aiming to confirm the necessity based on the features of the AA1 axis card. 

The EXP70 module proves essential for torque limit functionalities, while the main channel is dedicated to position and speed control. Considering the installation of a main module with an SSi input for SSI Temposonc or Balluff rod, the importance of a high-quality servo valve capable of flowing oil efficiently is emphasized. The selection of a cylinder with the appropriate size, possibly a 2-inch diameter, is crucial for optimal performance. For further assistance, reaching out to Delta Motion tech support is recommended to select the ideal components for the application.</p>

            <p>For a recent project, I found that using Parker Hydraulic Servo controllers was extremely beneficial. The main issues we encountered were related to valves rather than the control system, specifically the Compax3 model. However, upon further research, I discovered that there is an upgrade option available: Servo Drives from Parker Hannifin.</p>

            <p>PreLC recommended Parker Hydraulic Servo controllers for a project, noting their high effectiveness. While some issues arose with valves, the control, specifically Compax3, performed well. Looking into upgrades, Parker Hannifin offers Servo Drives that could be beneficial. Despite the quality of Parker products, lead times for Parker parts such as VFDs, servo motors/drives, and accessories have been a concern. This has led to a hesitation in using Parker products, despite their reputation. It is possible that different divisions within the company have varying lead times, with the hydraulics division potentially being more efficient. Have you noticed any improvements in lead times for Parker hydraulic products?</p>

            <p>PreLC mentioned using Parker Hydraulic Servo controllers for a project, finding them to be highly effective with minimal issues arising from the valves rather than the control itself, specifically the Compax3 model. However, an upgrade option is now available with the Servo Drives from Parker Hannifin. Approximately a decade ago, Parker approached us to develop a new controller or enhance their existing one, but we declined the offer. Recent revelations from Parker indicate their struggles to comprehend the RMC system, as our algorithms surpass basic PID capabilities. As a result, older models M02AS and HYD02 are now obsolete, leading us to become an Automation Partner with Rockwell instead. Contrary to popular belief, we do not compete with Parker controllers; in fact, we collaborate by allowing their dealers to distribute our controllers. In the early 2000s, I provided training on servo control for Parker's Hydraulic Specialist Engineer program. While Parker DF1 and DF3 valves are reliable, it's essential to ensure the spools are linear when considering valves from Bosch and Moog. Additionally, Santest and Yuken valves are reputable alternatives, while Star Hydraulic valves are preferred for six-degree-of-freedom applications. Over the past two decades, I have authored numerous magazine articles, notably for publications such as Power and Motion, which has now absorbed content from Hydraulics and Pneumatics and Machine Design. These articles are archived on Delta Motion servers for reference.</p>
