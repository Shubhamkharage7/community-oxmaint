            <p>To better grasp your issue, it would be helpful to see a photo of your bearing housing with the deflector. What is the purpose of the deflector in a sleeve bearing setup? In order for a fire to occur, there needs to be oxygen, heat, and fuel present. The air provides oxygen while the fuel comes from the lube oil, which will only burn if the temperature reaches the oil's flash point. Where did the heat originate from and what type of insulation material is being used, ceramic or rockwool? Can you provide more information on why the labyrinth seal was mentioned? It's worth noting that while the fluid in question is steam, which is not flammable, it may be at a high temperature. What type of sealing mechanism are you currently using?</p>

            <p>Ensure that your bearings are properly lubricated with slinger rings and oil deflectors securely positioned on the shaft for optimal performance. Regularly monitor the oil levels in the housing to prevent excessive oil leakage. Additionally, inspect the steam end seals, specifically the carbon rings seals, to identify any potential issues. By following these maintenance steps, you can ensure the efficient operation of your equipment.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, I wanted to discuss the sleeve bearing in this machine, which features sealing through deflectors on the housing ends. The oil level in this machine is well-maintained, and it also has rockwool insulation, which is commonly used in these cases. In my opinion, the labyrinth seal is effective at containing and sealing the oil. However, I have a question - could the steam sealing through carbon rings be causing the oil to evaporate from the housing? Let me know your thoughts on this issue.</p>

Ensure that the labyrinth design includes return holes positioned at the bottom, and that breathers or vents are unobstructed. This will help optimize the performance of the seal and prevent any potential issues.</p>

            <p>When it comes to labyrinth seals, Logic offers a solid solution. While Inpro is a popular choice, there are similar options available on the market. It's important to note that overfilling the oil reservoir in any labyrinth seal, such as Inpro, can result in leakage. Each design can only accommodate a specific amount of flow return within the housing. Explore the variety of labyrinth seals available in the market to find the perfect fit for your needs.</p>

            <p>Hello, at the facility I work in, we have been experiencing recurring issues with oil leaks from the deflector and unexpected bearing failures despite vibration monitoring. Upon investigating the equipment's history, I discovered two modifications: the addition of an air purge system for the bearings and a reduction in oil pressure. Originally, the oil pressure reached 1.5 bars, but it was later limited to 1 bar due to concerns with the aux lube oil pump. While this adjustment resolved the oil leak problem, I am concerned it may be impacting the sleeve bearing's lubrication and leading to failures. Can anyone share what the optimal oil pressure should be for our system? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Greetings, At the power plants where I am employed, all turbine lube oil systems are equipped with vapor extractors. These compact electric blowers are designed to remove vapors from the reservoirs and release them outside. Additionally, they create a vacuum in the bearing housings by utilizing the large oil drain lines to ensure sufficient head space above the return oil flow to the tank. This setup creates a sealed system with the bearing housings, reservoirs, and drain lines all operating under a slight vacuum. If this vacuum is compromised, it can result in leaks from the bearing housing seals. To monitor this vacuum, we use a water manometer on the reservoir. The manufacturer recommended maintaining a vacuum level that prevents oil leakage from the bearings, typically a few inches of water vacuum. I recommend checking if your turbine system includes a similar setup for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>I completely support Paul's comments regarding oil leakage from turbine bearings. In my experience, an oil leakage issue occurred due to a modification on the discharge pipe of oil vapor extractor fans. The discharge venting pipe was positioned towards the suction filter of the air washer fan, leading to fume odors in the turbine hall. To rectify this, the height of the discharge pipe was raised slightly, causing poor performance of the small fans on the oil tank. It is important to check if your turbine has similar mountings to prevent such issues. Examine the setup to ensure optimal performance and prevent any potential oil leakage problems.</p>

            <p>Yahoo and Elliott both have a similar deflector design with a slight labyrinth in the center. An air purge system has been installed in the middle of the deflector by drilling into the housing between the inner and outer disk. The air pressure is set at 1 to 3 psi. This modification was made to prevent moisture from entering the bearing rather than to stop an oil leak. However, it's important to note that air purge can potentially lead to oil mist leakage from breathers. Despite trying Enpro seals to combat moisture, oil leaks occurred after any maintenance activities that involved lifting the bearing cap only. Resealing successfully requires removing the rotor. Additionally, it's essential to check the edges and corners of the labyrinth part of the deflector, as rounded corners can cause leakage. If corners have been polished or chamfered, it could unintentionally create issues, as happened in a past experience.</p>

            <p>A deflector is installed to redirect steam from leaking carbon rings to prevent accidents. To avoid oil leakage, a labyrinth is incorporated into the bearing housing. Oil spillage can lead to auto ignition due to insulation and radiation, resulting in fires. To prevent this, inspect and replace the labyrinth if clearances are insufficient. Check the drain holes in the maze and clear any blockages. If needed, enlarge the holes to ensure proper drainage inside the housing. This maintenance will help prevent oil leaks and potential hazards.</p>

            <p>Our team encountered issues with a pump that had laby seals with small drain holes at the bottom. The original seals had tiny holes, which led to oil leaks. To address this, we replaced them with new OEM seals from our inventory, which had larger drain holes to prevent blockages. Another common problem we faced with similar seals was excessive sealant application between the upper and lower halves, causing blockages in the labyrinths and hindering oil flow to the drain holes. It is crucial to properly maintain seals to prevent leakage and ensure smooth pump operation.</p>

            <p>In order to properly control vapor emissions, small electric blowers are utilized to extract vapors from reservoirs and expel them outside. Paul suggests trying an air ejector on the bearing housing to prevent vapor escape. Watchorn notes that sharp corners on a deflector can lead to leakage in the lab section. It is important to ensure proper clearance to avoid this issue. Additionally, to address steam leakage from turbine packing rings, it would be helpful to hear any suggestions from Arvind. Thank you to everyone for their insights and contributions.</p>
