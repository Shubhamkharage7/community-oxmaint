            <p>Doug, I understand your perspective on the importance of integrating 100% of jobs into the CMMS system. However, is there a solid justification for maintaining 80% Preventive Maintenance? What makes Preventive Maintenance superior to Breakdown Maintenance in cases where failure consequences are minimal or non-existent? If you have an ample amount of spare capacity or utilize intermediate buffer storage, it may be difficult to justify implementing Preventive Maintenance. On the other hand, if you can accurately predict the degradation process, Condition-based Predictive Maintenance can prove to be highly beneficial. The decision regarding the ratio of Preventive Maintenance to Total work should be based on the potential consequences of failure, which can only be assessed by evaluating the specific configuration and conditions in your facility. Our main objective should be minimizing total risk, which may not necessarily align with maximizing Preventive Maintenance efforts. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>When comparing reactionary work orders to planned maintenance tasks (such as PM and PdM), the objective is to ensure that the number of reactive work orders is kept below 20%. Reactive work orders refer to jobs that are typically carried out without prior planning, usually within a week's time frame. This type of work often leads to unexpected overtime and the need for on-the-spot planning.

For example, let's consider a scenario where the burner fuel oil pressure is gradually dropping over time. The minimum pressure required for proper fuel atomization is 150 psi, with the normal range being 300-350 psi. At around 250 psi, maintenance is alerted and a shutdown is scheduled. Possible causes are identified (such as issues with the burner tip, fuel pump, or controller), preliminary checks are conducted, and the situation is monitored closely (planned scenario).

On the other hand, imagine a situation where maintenance staff arrives on a Monday morning to discover that an emergency shutdown occurred over the weekend, resulting in the furnace being full of oil (reactive scenario). This type of situation does not fall under the category of Preventive Maintenance, yet it is a common occurrence in many facilities.</p>

            <p>quote: In a successful maintenance strategy, the target is to keep reactive work orders below 20%. While high consequence failures may warrant preventive maintenance or predictive maintenance activities, there are also minor failures that have little to no impact on safety or production. If spare equipment is in place, the failure of a piece of equipment should not disrupt operations. Apart from basic lubrication and minimal condition monitoring, it can be argued that no additional maintenance is necessary, and running equipment to failure is acceptable unless it leads to significant internal damage. The threshold of 20% for reactive work orders is not a universal rule and can vary depending on the specific situation. It is important to assess each case individually to determine the most effective maintenance approach. Any other method would be suboptimal. V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>I have come across the myth of 80% PPM (periodic preventive maintenance) but have not found any written evidence to support it. The concept of the 80-20 rule regarding planned versus reactive work orders can be found in Terry Wireman's book "Developing Performance Indicators for Managing Maintenance." The decision to use the run-to-failure method depends on the type of equipment and its production function. For example, the run-to-failure method may be suitable for car wiper blades, as you wouldn't replace them every six months. However, in a production environment, things are handled differently. Spare equipment, including critical spare equipment, is typically installed to minimize downtime. It is crucial to have a minimum of 2 spare equipment pieces to avoid production delays. In a 24-hour operation, relying solely on reactive maintenance can lead to operational issues. Ideally, a maintenance strategy with 0% reactive maintenance and a focus on preventive maintenance may be more suitable for certain equipment rather than the entire plant.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, As you may know, a lot of individuals strive for an 80% Preventive Maintenance (PM) and 20% Corrective Maintenance (CM) ratio. After achieving this target, I am curious about the total cost of all PM and CM tasks, as well as the plant uptime percentage. Many aim for an optimal uptime of 97%, but will the total cost align with <3% of Cost Per Runtime Hour (CPRV) and <10-15% of overall manufacturing expenses? Are there any published results validating this approach as the right direction to take? I am seeking evidence that the Mitchell's benchmarks are indeed feasible for practical implementation. Therefore, I look forward to seeing more real-world results compared to the Mitchell's benchmarks. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, I understand the goal of achieving a 97% availability rate and having 80% of work planned. However, I question the need for 80% of work to be preventive. Breakdown maintenance can be a valid strategy in certain circumstances, with some cases having it account for up to 50% of total maintenance. During RCM analysis, it is common to discover that breakdown maintenance is the most cost-effective option for many failure modes. The decision on maintenance strategy depends on factors such as system configuration, spare unit availability, and storage capacity. While striving to plan 80% or more of maintenance work, it is important to include planning for breakdown maintenance as well, even though scheduling may be more challenging due to the uncertainty of breakdown timing. Though proactive maintenance to prevent all failures may seem trendy, it is not always the most cost-effective approach. I believe in only conducting preventive or condition monitoring maintenance when the consequences of failure are significant. In manufacturing plants with single-line production and minimal storage, the consequences of failures are usually high, making a high proportion of preventive maintenance necessary. In other scenarios, the need for preventive maintenance varies. Best regards, V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>I concur with the perspectives shared. My manufacturing facility operates on a single production line, with the primary goal being to attain 80% Preventive Maintenance (PM) works by managing costs related to manhours, materials, and contracts, while allocating 20% for Corrective Maintenance (CM) and Breakdown Maintenance (BM) works. However, my concern lies in whether achieving this target will result in a plant uptime of 97% and if the overall cost of all works (80% PM & 20% CM) is truly cost-effective. Are there any documented outcomes that validate the feasibility and benefits of pursuing this approach in the long run? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, unfortunately, just planning isn't enough to see good results. You also need to ensure compliance and work quality. Compliance means sticking to your planned timeline and completing tasks within an acceptable margin of error. As for work quality, it's crucial to meet standards for cleanliness, alignment, balancing, clearances, tightness, and more. Without these elements, your plans will remain just that - plans. - V.

            <p>Hello Josh, as discussed in previous forums, the relationship between routine maintenance and availability is not as straightforward as some may think. It is common these days to oversimplify maintenance practices, which goes against logical thinking and safety standards. The level of routine maintenance needed (whether preventive, predictive, or detective) is influenced by the plant's setup, risk tolerance, and the consequences of failure. Depending on the amount of standby equipment available, a plant may opt for a maintenance routine that includes a substantial amount of planned corrective works, or run-to-failure methods for cost-effectiveness. Conversely, a plant with limited standby equipment may require more routine maintenance. It is important to note that excessive maintenance can actually lead to reduced reliability. Therefore, the assumption that more routine maintenance results in lower costs and higher availability is not always valid in modern times. Cheers, Daryl Mather from Strategic-Advantages.com.</p>

            <p>Josh, I noticed that the link isn't working. In the realm of maintenance, the distinction between Planned Maintenance (PM) and Reactive Maintenance is crucial. Preventive or Preventative Maintenance is often referred to as PM by maintenance professionals. Am I correct in this assumption?</p>

            <p>Planned maintenance consists of scheduled preventive and predictive maintenance as well as planned inspection routines, which can be either time-based or condition-based. These tasks are essential for optimizing equipment performance and minimizing downtime. In contrast, reactive maintenance occurs when issues are addressed only after they have been identified by operations personnel or equipment failure. Achieving a balance between planned and reactive maintenance is crucial for maximizing operational efficiency. Thank you.</p>

            <p>There is a belief that the proportion of planned maintenance (PM) versus reactive maintenance (RM) required for industrial plants is influenced by factors such as the presence of standby equipment. In my experience, standby equipment like pumps and fans are more feasible for smaller equipment, while larger and critical machinery such as fired heaters, boilers, and compressors may not be cost-effective to operate in parallel due to the potential for significant production and HSE losses in the event of a failure. Is there a method to measure the overall reliability of a facility based on its setup, and use this information to determine the optimal amount of planned maintenance needed? Thank you.</p>

            <p>I opt not to implement Planned Maintenance, as the focus of the initial discussion was on the ratio of Preventive Maintenance to Reactive Maintenance (80-20%). This ratio of Planned Workorders to Reactive Workorders provides insight into maintenance execution, rather than being heavily influenced by plant configuration. A maintenance strategy with 80% reactive work can lead to high costs, subpar work quality, increased overtime, heightened stress levels, and potentially unskilled workers, supervisors, and ineffective management.</p>

            <p>Hello Svanels, you've really hit the nail on the head! While aiming for 80%+ planned maintenance is commendable, the level of preventive maintenance needed can vary based on the associated risks. There is often negative talk surrounding reactive maintenance, but I believe it can be acceptable in low-risk situations. It is possible to plan for reactive maintenance by anticipating possible scenarios, identifying necessary steps, materials, and safety precautions in advance. Despite the unpredictability of when these maintenance tasks may arise, it is still beneficial to plan ahead. There appears to be some confusion regarding terminology related to maintenance practices. Regards, V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Identifying critical equipment is essential in operating a small refinery like ours. From a list of over 200 pieces of equipment, we have identified 20 as critical. This selection includes steam boilers, diesel generators, air compressors, pumps, and more, all crucial for production and safety. This list, carefully curated by maintenance and operations teams and approved by management, ensures that vital systems remain operational at all times. Some equipment, like heaters, require regular servicing but cannot be taken offline frequently due to their importance in the process. Heat exchangers, columns, and vessels are also included in this category, receiving maintenance during scheduled turnarounds. Additionally, there is an unofficial list of critical equipment, such as the central air conditioning unit in the director's office, which, when malfunctioning, can cause chaos with non-stop phone calls.</p>

            <p>Hold on a moment....are you simply promoting your software to me? It might be wise to identify yourself as a vendor to avoid angering Bryan. By the way, this discussion was last active over 8 years ago. Vee and Josh have departed from the forum, and Steven sadly passed away years ago.</p>

By the way, this discussion was last active over 8 years ago. Vee and Josh are no longer part of the forum, and Steven has sadly passed away years ago. I've only been a member for a few months, but I was shocked by your comments as I have been following their discussions since joining. It was heartbreaking to find out about their absence.</p>
