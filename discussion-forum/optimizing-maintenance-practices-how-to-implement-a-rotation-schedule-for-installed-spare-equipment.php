            <p>Achieving full consensus on the topic of rotating online and standby equipment may be challenging, but there are different opinions within this forum. Some suggest running primary and backup equipment without rotating them, while others recommend running the primary most of the time and the standby online for short periods at specific intervals. Personally, I advocate for regular rotations. In our power plant, most "balance of plant" equipment has an installed spare. We switch between the A and B systems monthly, with the A side running during even months (Feb, Apr, Jun...) and the B side running during odd months (Jan, Mar, May...). This schedule ensures that equipment run times are evenly distributed, and gives us a good understanding of the standby side's condition. Despite the occasional need for close-overhaul occurrences, such as vertical turbine pumps running over 60,000 hours each within a year, our approach has proven successful over the past 20 years. While not everyone may agree with our method, it has worked effectively for our power station operations.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment important for optimal maintenance practices?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment is important because it helps ensure that the spare equipment remains functional and ready for use when needed. By rotating the spares into operation regularly, you can prevent issues such as deterioration due to lack of use and ensure that the equipment is in working condition.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What are industry best practices for implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Industry best practices for implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment typically involve assessing equipment and process needs, establishing a schedule for rotating spares into operation, and gaining buy-in from the operations group. It is important to consider factors such as equipment usage frequency, maintenance requirements, and criticality when developing a rotation schedule.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How can we get the operations group on board with implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Getting the operations group on board with implementing a rotation schedule for installed spare equipment may require clear communication about the benefits of the strategy, such as improved equipment reliability and reduced downtime. It can also be helpful to involve the operations group in the development of the rotation schedule and address any concerns or challenges they may have. Sharing personal experiences and success stories from other facilities can also help demonstrate the value of the strategy.</p>
