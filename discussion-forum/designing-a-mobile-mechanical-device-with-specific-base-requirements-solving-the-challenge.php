                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently facing a challenging non-plc issue while designing a mechanical device with specific design parameters for its base/foundation. The device must have a small footprint of approximately 3 feet in diameter, be heavy weighing several hundred pounds, and be mobile for easy manual or powered assistance to move it to a precise location. 
Meeting all three requirements simultaneously is quite complex. Ideally, the solution would resemble an oversized 800 lb hockey puck, easy to move like a puck sliding on ice or similar to R2D2. 
The closest option I have found is a drum dolly on casters, capable of holding 800lbs of weight. While this may suffice, it may be challenging to move precisely. 
A potential solution could involve a motorized drum dolly or one that is floating on air (a fantasy concept). Any suggestions or ideas on this matter are welcomed.</p>

            <p>If you are considering using an "Air pallet," it is important to assess whether it is suitable for the specific types of surfaces you will be navigating. Explore more about this innovative technology by conducting a search on Google.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey recommended searching for "Air pallet" or "air skates" to see if they would be suitable for moving heavy items in your specific environment. Air pallets and air skates are commonly used in warehouses to easily maneuver items on smooth surfaces. However, it is important to consider the nature of the surfaces you need to traverse to ensure their effectiveness. For example, while they can glide smoothly on polished concrete floors, they may encounter difficulty on uneven surfaces like cracked concrete.</p>

            <p>Located just south of Seattle, the top players in the field of "air casters" can be found nearby at https://www.aerogo.com/. Recently, we implemented a new system utilizing their air casters and electric hand tugs to move the lifting base of a massive spaceship. This task proved to be the easiest part of the project, as we simply purchased the equipment from Aerogo and attached it underneath the weldments.</p>
