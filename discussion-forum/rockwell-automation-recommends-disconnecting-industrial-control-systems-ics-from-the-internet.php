            <p>I was not a fan of the wording in that headline, as it hinted at a potential new vulnerability or cyber campaign targeting Rockwell, similar to how Unitronics in Tel Aviv was attacked by cyber-saboteurs. Perhaps a more suitable headline could be "The Importance of Not Connecting PLCs Directly to the Internet Now More Than Ever". This statement closely reflects discussions held during a recent company meeting on remote access protocols and our updated password security measures.</p>

            <p>In the words of Ken Roach, it is crucial to refrain from directly connecting your PLCs to the Internet. Many individuals may be tempted to connect without a valid reason, but it is important to exercise caution and only connect when necessary. Just because it is possible does not mean it is advisable.</p>
