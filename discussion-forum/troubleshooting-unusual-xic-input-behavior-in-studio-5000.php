                    <p>Greetings everyone, I am currently making updates to our electrical program in preparation for work to be completed this upcoming Sunday. I have double-checked to ensure that my inputs were not in use and were accessible. However, when I added the XIC input, I noticed that it appeared as though it was closed even though it was properly wired. Is this a common occurrence or did I overlook something? Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback and insights.</p>

            <p>It seems like there may be some confusion with your question. If the input tag is showing as "energized" even though it is wired, that doesn't seem to make sense. Typically, if it is not wired properly, it should not display as energized. Can you provide a screenshot of your code or the tag database to help clarify the current condition of the input tag? This additional information will help us better understand the issue at hand and provide you with the most accurate solution.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Charley from voos stated that the situation described is a bit puzzling. Despite being connected, the input tag appears to be energized, which is contrary to what one would expect. It does not seem logical for an unwired input tag to show as energized. Charley inquired about why the tag is not "closed" when it is properly wired. Requesting a screenshot of the code and/or the tag database to investigate the current state of the input tag. The input tag is currently set at a value of 1, but any attempts to change it to 0 automatically revert back to 1.</p>

            <p>User chall234 raised a concern about a value being stuck at 1 instead of being set to zero. This issue may arise when trying to switch between program mode and run mode or if the address being monitored is not on the correct module. To troubleshoot further, it is recommended to provide screenshots of the I/O configuration and ladder or tag displaying the current state.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Before proceeding with troubleshooting, ensure that you are verifying the correct input address. Check the card to see if the LED is illuminated, as this indicates the presence of voltage. Confirm if voltage is actually being received from a source. If issues persist, consider if the card is faulty and if necessary, test by replacing it with a known working card.</p>

            <p>User chall234 mentioned a concern regarding a value being stuck at 1, despite attempts to change it to 0. This issue is likely due to the input receiving a signal that reverts it back to 1. Unfortunately, inputs cannot be manually edited. Refer to the troubleshooting steps outlined in previous responses to address this issue effectively.</p>

            <p>Please elaborate on the phrase "even though it is wired" in your initial post. Did you intend to say "un-wired"? If the device is indeed wired, it signifies that there is voltage present, regardless of whether it is being utilized in the programming.</p>

            <p>Upon closer inspection, I noticed a mysterious wire that doesn't seem to be connected to anything specific. This has left me uncertain about its purpose and functionality. Interestingly, the documentation labels it as a spare part, adding to the confusion surrounding its role within the system. Overall, it's a perplexing cluster of components that requires further investigation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To determine if an electrical circuit is functioning correctly, check the voltage at the input terminal. If the voltage exceeds the input's turn-on threshold, the circuit is operating as expected. Alternatively, lift the wire and observe if the voltage remains constant. If the voltage remains constant when the wire is lifted, there may be an issue with the input circuit such as physical damage or an incorrect address being monitored.</p>
