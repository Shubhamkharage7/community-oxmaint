            <p>I primarily rely on spreadsheet software like Excel, as well as occasionally utilizing a monte carlo RAM simulator such as Raptor and a program for weibull parameter estimation for failure analysis (Reliability and Maintenance Analyst). I also make use of the Oreda database for reference. Panuphan, please share the tools and programs you utilize as well. Best regards, Rogier.</p>

            <p>Typically, I rely on Excel for generating a variety of reports for our management team to easily understand the plant's current situation. On the engineering side, we utilize both Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) methods. I suggest incorporating Weibull analysis and reliability growth analysis into our processes for improved insights.</p>
