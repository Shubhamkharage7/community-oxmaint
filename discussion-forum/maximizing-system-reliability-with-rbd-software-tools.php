                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>For several years, we have conducted streamlined and modified RCM studies at our facilities, which have proven to be highly beneficial for our FDA validated GMP systems. While the streamlined RCM process has its limitations, such as time and resource constraints, we are now seeking to utilize software tools for Reliability Block Diagram analyses on our non-GMP and facilities support systems. Our goal is to conduct these studies on both existing and new systems during the concept design phase. We are eager to gather insights from users of such tools and their experiences, as well as reaching out to vendors for further information. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Dan Wise.</p>

            <p>At ARMS Reliability Engineers, we utilize AvSim+ from the Isograph software suite for creating Reliability Block Diagrams (RBDs). AvSim+ is a robust availability and capacity modeling software that empowers users to enhance plant design, maintenance strategies, and spares management. By leveraging AvSim+, you can construct RBDs and input details regarding failure modes, maintenance expenses, and operational consequences. The advanced Monte Carlo simulation feature enables you to forecast plant capacity, maintenance costs, spares utilization, resource allocation, operational inefficiencies, safety hazards, and environmental risks. I oversaw the development of a comprehensive site RBD comprising around 5000 blocks using AvSim+, a project that spanned 60 days. The resulting roadmap offered insights into enhancing overall plant availability by pinpointing problematic areas causing downtime and capacity limitations. These issues were then targeted for further Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) or Root Cause Analysis (RCA) methodologies. Additionally, we have designed RBDs during the plant's initial stages to optimize operations and predict the project's business implications. For more details, visit www.reliability.com.au or www.isograph-software.com. Cheers - Gary</p>

            <p>Hi Gary, I found the information you shared very intriguing. Can you provide details on the initial software costs and training expenses for a skilled Reliability engineer well-versed in simulation modeling, RBDs, and FTAs? It's impressive to model 5000 blocks in just 60 days, as mentioned on their website. If you have this information, we would appreciate it if you could share it with us. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Vee, I appreciate your response. The Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) I mentioned took a total of 68 days to complete, with the assistance of another person for half of that time. The RBD focused on a high-level analysis and did not delve into specific failure modes. For information on software and training costs, please email your request to info@reliability.com.au. You will receive a prompt response with our training matrix for a Reliability Engineer. Thank you - Gary.</p>

I have found that the free version of Raptor is suitable for high-level studies, while the commercial version offers more detailed features. Additionally, SPARC (System for Production Availability and Resources Consumption) from Shell Global Solutions is another highly recommended program.
