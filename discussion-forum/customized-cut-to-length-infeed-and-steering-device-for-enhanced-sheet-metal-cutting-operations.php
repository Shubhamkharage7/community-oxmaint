                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Todd and I specialize in working on and maintaining computer-controlled machinery. I am interested in building a customized cut-to-length infeed and steering device to enhance the operation of an existing machine. Many different controls can be used to stop the feeding process for precise cutting, but a braking motor would be essential for quick stops. I aim to implement a guillotine-style shear or notcher on linear rails that move at the same speed as the rollformer during cutting. The control system I have in mind involves a basic setup with a touch screen PLC and encoder. I am seeking recommendations for an affordable controller and compatible encoder. Additionally, my cutting setup will involve signaling a pneumatic solenoid to activate an air cylinder quickly and efficiently. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts and advice on this project. Feel free to contact me at Todd3156640495.</p>

            <p>When determining affordability, it's important to consider the mass of the mechanism being moved during cutting, as it will impact the motor size needed for the job, ultimately influencing the drive size. These components are typically the costliest in a control system. It's crucial to choose a servo that can seamlessly transition between indexing and follower modes without requiring a power cycle to avoid potential issues. I learned this lesson the hard way through personal experience.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum community! What motion controller brands and models have you worked with in the past? Take stock of the current equipment in your facility, as it is often best to stick with something similar to your existing setup. When choosing controls hardware, it is important to prioritize functionality over cost for individual applications.

It is essential to have a controller that can seamlessly switch between indexing and follower/gearing modes. The size and type of servo motor needed will depend on the weight of the shear and its carriage. When operating the air cylinder for the shear, ensure you calculate and specify the required speed in seconds.

For the rollformer application with sheet metal, providing details about the material and feed process can be helpful. How is the material currently being cut?</p>

            <p>An example of a RMC75 performing a flying shear is shown in this demonstration. Our team and our clients have successfully implemented numerous flying shears using this technology. The program for this operation can be easily downloaded from the link provided. To view and edit the program, you will need to download RMCTools from the official Delta Motion website.

The programs and videos showcasing this technology date back to 2009. The RMC boasts an advanced gear move instruction that simplifies the motion control process into a single command. This instruction enables seamless turnaround without any pauses, allowing for deceleration through zero velocity. This feature not only saves valuable time but also reduces travel distance by approximately 1/2 inch, resulting in quicker positioning back to the starting point.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey questioned the definition of affordability when it comes to selecting the necessary components for a control system. The size of the motor required will depend on the mass of the mechanism moving downstream during cutting, ultimately determining the drive size. These components are typically the most costly. It is crucial to choose a servo that can easily switch between indexing and follower modes without needing to cycle power to prevent any issues. 

For a budget of around $5,000, the necessary components include contacts, relays, VFD, and touch screen controls for a sheet metal cutting operation. The material ranges from 26 gauge to 24 gauge with flat cut shear or notching widths between 2.25 to 8 inches. The cutting process will be carried out by air cylinders with a 1-second full cycle time and a travel speed of approximately 40-50 fpm. The travel distance for the flying shear will be between 1 to 4 inches before returning to position. The controller only needs to be able to program three separate batches, each consisting of 99 pieces.

A query arises regarding whether one controller can operate and measure two separate encoders simultaneously while cutting two different sized parts with different profiles on the same machine.</p>

            <p>In determining the best cutting recommendations for sheet metal, the key factor to consider is the cross-cut speed of the material being cut. The width of the material ranges from 2 to 8 inches wide, with a thickness of 26g to 24g sheet metal. The shear is designed to travel only 1 inch down before returning up, all controlled by pneumatics.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach warmly welcomes you to the PLCTalk forum community! What experience do you have with different brands and models of motion controllers? Take stock of the equipment in your facility to determine the most suitable option to purchase. The cost of control hardware should not be the primary factor when choosing equipment for a specific application.

It is essential to have a controller that can switch between indexing and follower/gearing mode. The servo motor's power and type will depend on the shear's mass and carriage. When operating the air cylinder, calculate the speed needed to move it up and down efficiently.

When working with a rollformer and sheet metal, consider describing the material and feed process. Current methods involve cutting material into ten-foot lengths with widths ranging from 2-8 inches. The material is then fed through a roll former and cut into various lengths. Opting for pre-slit material fed by a 1HP motor with a VFD for infeed and shearing assembly control may be suitable. This system can operate on either 120V single-phase or 220V single-phase power.</p>

            <p>Todd Braman expressed his interest in building a project within a budget of $5,000. He mentioned the need for various components such as contacts, relays, VFD, and touch screen controls. The RMC75 is equipped with +/- 10v for the VFD, digital I/O expansion modules, and communication options like Ethernet or USB for HMIs. It is recommended to connect the RMC75 to a PLC for efficient operation without the need for additional purchases. The machine will be constructed using sheet metal ranging from 26 to 24 gauge, with cutting mechanisms controlled by air cylinders for precise operation. The controller should be able to program three separate batches of up to 99 pieces each. 

Is it possible for one controller to operate and measure two separate encoders simultaneously, cutting different sized parts on the same machine? While two encoders can be used, only one is required per line. The RMC75 can handle two lines at once and allows for real-time adjustments in cut lengths. Utilizing cubic splines or PLC cams is common practice, and the RMC75 is capable of real-time computation and adjustments. For more advanced capabilities, the newer RMC200 models can communicate with drives using Ethercat.</p>

            <p>I have experience working with various types of cutting machines such as Rotary Shears, Guillotine Shears, and Traveling Saws. It is essential to ensure that the flying shear is running at the same speed as the material at the point of contact. When using a Rotary Shear, adjustments need to be made to the shear knife speed based on the material length being cut. 

For optimal performance, I recommend using a Yaskawa GA800 series drive set up as a flux vector drive with a 5000 PPR Encoder. Utilize the digital pulse output and digital pulse input speed reference to synchronize speeds effectively. 

I have personally implemented this method with successful outcomes, noting that a higher PPR number yields better performance. Surprisingly, a servo system is not necessary as Flux Vector drives can deliver superior results at a more affordable price. A quality PLC system should suffice for this application.</p>
