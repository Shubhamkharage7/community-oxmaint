                    <p>Upon installing Studio 5000 and Logix Designer v32, everything seemed to be running smoothly until I attempted to enable the Bookmark Toolbar. Initially, this action caused a fatal error and forced the program to close. However, after researching online, I discovered a solution: running Studio 5000 as an administrator, then selecting the toolbar. Following these steps, I successfully enabled the Bookmark Toolbar without experiencing any crashes. Unfortunately, upon closing and reopening the program, the fatal error reoccurs immediately, even when running it as an admin. Is there a permanent solution to this issue?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum! In order to assist you better, please provide more details about your system setup. What operating system (OS) are you currently using? Are you running your system on a virtual machine (VM)? Additionally, we would like to know more about the fatal errors you encountered. What solution or "fix" did you discover and implement? A common troubleshooting step that often resolves issues is performing a computer shutdown followed by a restart. Many times, this simple action can help resolve errors and crashes automatically.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum provided by KuulKuum. To assist you better, we require more information about your system configuration. What operating system are you currently using, and are you utilizing a virtual machine? Could you please provide details of the fatal errors you encountered and the steps you took to address them?

In my case, I am using Windows 10 Enterprise without any virtual machines. The fatal error message I encountered is as follows: "Fatal Error! Application Path: ...... Elapsed execution time: 15 seconds Version: V32.00.00 (release) Location: 0xffffffffffff +-1 OS Version: Windows 8 64-bit Thread Id: 00002988 (10632) Error 0xc0000005 (-1073741819) EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION - An "access violation" exception was generated. Press OK to terminate this application."

After researching online, I discovered a workaround to enable the bookmark toolbar. Initially, the program ran smoothly until I attempted to check the bookmark toolbar box under view/toolbox, resulting in a crash with the same error message. Following someone's suggestion, I ran Studio 5000 as an administrator, enabling me to successfully activate the bookmark toolbar without any crashes. However, upon reopening the program, the error persisted despite multiple troubleshooting attempts including running as an admin and reinstalling the software.</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with Studio 5000 (LogixDesigner.exe), a good troubleshooting step is resetting it to the default configuration. Simply hold down the CTRL and SHIFT keys while opening LogixDesigner.exe. This can help resolve any software errors or glitches that may be affecting your system's performance.</p>

            <p>To troubleshoot a software issue, try restarting your computer and then locating the LogixDesigner.exe file in your Rockwell Software folder. Check its properties and set compatibility mode to "Windows 7" while also running it as an Administrator. If this doesn't resolve the issue, refer to the Rockwell Automation Knowledge base for further solutions, which may require "TechConnect Access" for viewing. Ensure you are using the latest version of Studio 5000 (currently 32.02.00) by updating from v32.00.00 if necessary.</p>

What perplexes me is that everything was functioning perfectly until I added the Bookmarks toolbar. I will persist in my efforts, hoping for a solution to surface. Upgrading to the latest version may not be feasible as my company does not possess V32.02.00 licenses. Your assistance is invaluable to me, and I am grateful for it. If I am able to resolve this issue, I will be sure to return and share my solution for anyone facing a similar predicament.</p>

It used to work perfectly fine before I involved the Bookmarks toolbar, which seems to have caused the issue. I will continue to experiment until I find a solution that works. Upgrading to the latest version may not be feasible as my company may not have the necessary licenses. Nonetheless, I appreciate the assistance. If I resolve this issue, I will be sure to share the solution for others facing similar challenges.

I found a helpful workaround by navigating to the project location, pressing Ctrl, Alt, and Shift simultaneously, and holding the buttons until the software completely reset. Upon releasing the buttons, I was able to access the file again. This method reset all settings, including the Bookmarks that were added. Thank you to everyone for the support.</p>

            <p>DDHR provides an update on their computer mishap, stating that they somehow made it worse and ended up ruining their operating system. This led to losing all files that were not backed up, requiring a re-installation of everything and attempting to recover files from the company's server. Despite the setback, the upside is that their logix is now functioning properly. The lesson learned is to refrain from trying to 'fix' something that is already working. As for a solution to the error without resorting to extreme measures, it remains unknown.

If you can relate to this computer nightmare, remember to regularly make backups, create restore points, and utilize virtual machines to prevent data loss. And if you were in DDHR's shoes, a beer would definitely be in order after such a struggle. We've all been there before!</p>
