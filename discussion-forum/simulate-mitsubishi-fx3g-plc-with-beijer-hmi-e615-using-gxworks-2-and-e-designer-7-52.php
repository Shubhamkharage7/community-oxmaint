                    <p>Hello, I own a Mitsubishi FX3G 14M PLC and an E615 HMI from Mitsubishi/Beijer. I am currently utilizing GXWorks 2 for programming with no issues in simulating the program. As for the HMI, I am utilizing E-Designer 7.52. I have encountered difficulty in finding resources on simulating the HMI with the PLC. Most resources I have found involve using a real PLC with the HMI. Is it indeed impossible to simulate the HMI alongside the PLC using a simulator?</p>

            <p>The lack of a simulation mode in E-designer software has rendered it obsolete. Beijers has transitioned to the newer IX or later series, while the E series has been rebranded for Mitsubishi. However, Mitsubishi has since introduced their own GOT series, replacing Beijers. The software used for the GOT series is GT Designer, which includes a simulator that can be connected to GXworks simulator. Unlike the newer series, the E series requires a physical HMI & PLC for simulation purposes.</p>

            <p>Parky mentioned that E-designer does not have a simulation mode and is considered obsolete. Beijers has transitioned to the newer IX series or later, with the E series being rebranded for Mitsubishi. However, Mitsubishi has discontinued Beijers in favor of their own GOT series, which uses GT Designer software with a simulator that can connect to GXworks simulator. For the E series, a physical HMI & PLC are required. Thank you for the thorough response. Is there any alternative software available for the E615 that supports simulation?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>As far as I know, E-designer was discontinued around 2015 and was never updated to include a simulation feature. However, I have found a solution by using GT Designer, which offers a simulation mode that can connect to GXWorks2 or GXDeveloper. By copying the tags into GT Designer, I was able to create a functional HMI based on my experience with E-designer. While the transition was a bit lengthy, it served my purposes well. It is worth noting that the functions of the GOT differ slightly from E-designer, requiring some adjustments. Overall, I believe E-designer was superior to Beijers IX software and Mitsubishi GOT, despite missing some features.</p>

            <p>hafizzz_ahmad inquired about a replacement software for E615 that supports simulation. Beijer does not offer a replacement, but you can simulate a PLC/HMI environment using GT Designer 3 and GX Works 2, which are commonly used to program Mitsubishi GOT HMIs. If you have installed GX Works 2 through the "iQ Works" package, it also includes GX Works 3 and GT Designer 3.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Can I simulate the Mitsubishi FX3G PLC with Beijer HMI E615 using GXWorks 2 and E-Designer 7.52 without physical hardware?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Unfortunately, simulating both the HMI and PLC together without physical hardware can be challenging as most resources focus on using a real PLC with the HMI for simulation.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Are there any alternative methods or tools to simulate the Beijer HMI E615 with the Mitsubishi FX3G PLC for testing purposes?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While direct simulation without physical hardware may be complex, you could explore virtualization software or emulators that mimic the behavior of the HMI and PLC for testing.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Is there a specific reason why simulating the Beijer HMI E615 alongside the Mitsubishi FX3G PLC is not straightforward?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The complexity arises from the interaction between the HMI and PLC systems, which may require real-time communication and synchronization that is typically achieved with physical hardware connections.</p>
