                    <p>Encountered an old Schneider PLC model PC-E984-265 at my workplace. After researching online, I discovered that it is typically programmed using Concept software. However, I struggled to establish a connection and had to contact Schneider tech support for assistance to no avail. To my surprise, it was actually programmed with Proworx NXT, a software I was unfamiliar with until now. I have been unable to locate a download link for Proworx NXT. While awaiting a response from Schneider, I am seeking guidance on where to find the necessary resources. Can anyone provide assistance on this matter?</p>

            <p>While troubleshooting an old Schneider PC-E984-265 PLC at work, I discovered that it was programmed using Proworx NXT instead of Concept. After hitting a roadblock trying to connect, I reached out to Schneider tech support for help, but to no avail. I am now on the lookout for a download link for Proworx NXT. If anyone can provide guidance or point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

            <p>Ram Munoz concurred, expressing their own struggle with the issue. It's been quite some time, but if memory serves me right, the customer possessed the installation files on a CD, requiring me to set up a Windows 95 virtual machine for its operation. The most troublesome part of this process was the inability to make any USB to serial drivers compatible with Windows 95. In the end, an experienced individual with a legacy computer featuring an integrated DB9 port had to make a physical appearance at the site to offer assistance. It was quite a challenging experience. Wishing you the best of luck in resolving your issue.</p>
