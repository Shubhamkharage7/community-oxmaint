            <p>The certification requirements vary depending on the industry segment you work in. In the Oil & Gas sector, ASQ's CRE certification is highly sought after in many job descriptions. For expertise in maintenance & reliability, the globally recognized CMRP certification is recommended. You can find more information about TUV India's CRE certification on their website at www.smrp.org. Would you mind sharing details or the link to this certification? Thank you. - Vinay</p>

            <p>Hello! The link to get more information is http://www.tuv.com/en/india. If you contact them via email, they can provide you with the training schedule for 2013. A common issue with ASQ CRE and CMRP certifications is the lack of training sessions in India and the Middle East. If you are aware of any upcoming training sessions, kindly inform me. Thank you.</p>
