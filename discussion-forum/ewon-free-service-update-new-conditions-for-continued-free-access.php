                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I received an email from the marketing team at e w o n this morning, informing me that the free e w o n service will only remain free under specific conditions. To avoid charges, it is necessary to add a new e w o n to your ecatcher account annually. Failure to do so will result in retroactive charges, requiring me to invoice 50 existing customers. It seems they have identified a new revenue stream. However, I believe they prioritize costs over value. The challenge lies in having separate ecatcher accounts for each customer, making it difficult to add a new e w o n each year. Do you have any suggestions for alternative systems that could be used?</p>

            <p>After struggling with unreliable eWons that required frequent restarts, I switched to using TosiBox three years ago. Since then, I have had no issues with my setup. While provisioning can sometimes require a couple of reboots for the device to recognize the USB Key, it is nothing major. Building your own solution with open source VPN software may be the only way to avoid potential issues in the future, but who has the time to do so? That's why I stick with TosiBox. LOL.</p>

            <p>Tosibox is transitioning to a subscription-based business model. One drawback is that only the USB key owner can access the internet, which can be inconvenient. Mobile keys require ordering and there may be a delay in receiving them. In comparison, Beijer's CloudVPN user management allows for instant access control, enabling you to grant or deny access at any time. One convenient feature is the ability to provide temporary access, with automatic revocation afterwards.</p>

            <p>Avoiding anything related to Beijer has been a challenge for me. I made a vow to steer clear of Beijer products for good, especially after experiencing the paraffin power you mentioned earlier. However, I may have to temporarily abandon my principles and indulge in some liquid courage over the weekend in order to visit their website and explore their CloudVPN service. The thought of it makes me feel a bit uneasy and goes against my beliefs, but as the saying goes, "the enemy of my enemy is my friend." Perhaps the CloudVPN service is not linked to Beijer HMIs? It's possible that I can use other Beijer products without feeling that familiar knot in my stomach that comes with using their HMIs.</p>

            <p>A few years back, DraftSight made a bold move by transitioning their CAD program from free to a $99 annual subscription. Many users, including myself (I opted for NanoCAD), switched to alternative software like SkyCAD and NanoCAD. The drastic change in pricing caused DraftSight's customer base to plummet, prompting them to offer a 90% discount. Their aggressive email marketing tactics to promote this discount eventually led many to block them as spam.</p>

            <p>I find myself in a similar situation, dissatisfied with the current subscription model in place. There is always the concern that subscriptions may increase unexpectedly or terms may change. Like many, I also rely on IXON for now, as they offer their services for free. However, the trend towards subscription-based services seems inevitable. On a brighter note, I am experimenting with the open VPN and WireGuard VPN setup on my Gl.inet Slate AX router. This setup guarantees a lifetime of free service, with direct client-to-client connection and no intermediary cloud involvement. The router itself is priced at £100, making it a more budget-friendly option compared to most VPN cloud setups. I have successfully connected my laptop to the network and am in the process of testing its compatibility with the S7 device. My only challenge at the moment is setting up the dynamic DNS, as the VPN tunnel is not resolving to it yet. Nonetheless, everything is functioning smoothly when using my static WAN IP. I also have a Teltonika router that supports VPN connections, offering options for direct client-to-client setup or through their RMS gateway (which requires tokens for access). If anyone is interested, I can share screenshots and configuration details once everything is up and running smoothly, as I plan to sell 8 Ewons on eBay soon.</p>

            <p>Paraffin Power mentioned that Tosibox is transitioning to a subscription-based business model. One drawback is that only the owner of the USB key can access the online platform, making mobile keys inconvenient and subject to delays in ordering. In contrast, Beijer's CloudVPN user management allows for real-time access control, including the ability to grant temporary access that automatically expires. The additional cost for remote access through hardware is minimal compared to the overall project cost. USB keys offer added security by ensuring that only authorized individuals can access the network. Additionally, users can easily duplicate key connections for multiple users. Opting for a physical key connection may require more effort, but it eliminates potential delays associated with digital connections.</p>

            <p>I recently communicated with e*w*o*n regarding my subscription to a Virus protection package with unlimited VPN service for up to five devices, costing around £2.00 per year per device. I questioned them about their £1000 per year fee, and while they eventually responded, their explanation was not satisfactory. I also spoke with the UK IXON representative, who mentioned that there are currently no plans to switch to a subscription payment method. However, despite my reservations, it is currently the best option available and £100 cheaper than my previous provider, e*w*o*n.

In the past, I experimented with a client-to-client VPN system using a Netgear VPN Router, but found it challenging. One issue with standard VPNs is the requirement for a public facing IP address, which can be costly. Many machines now connect via mobile networks, which assign private IP addresses, posing a potential obstacle. Some providers offer fixed public IP addresses for a fee, while formerly free DDNS services have now become subscription-based.

For a more comprehensive solution, I suggest looking into Tailscale, a secure Remote Access tool built on WireGuard®️. Tailscale allows customizable connections between any resources on any infrastructure, following zero trust principles. Despite the initial complexity, it seems capable of meeting our needs at a reasonable cost of $18 per year for up to 100 devices. Consider using an industrial raspberrypi as a platform for Tailscale. If this interests you and you can make sense of it, please let me know.</p>

            <p>BryanG mentioned in a recent conversation that he raised concerns to a company about the high price of their annual subscription for a Virus protection package with unlimited VPN service for up to five devices. He highlighted that his current subscription costs only about £2.00 per device per year, making it difficult to justify a £1000 yearly fee. The company claimed their response was stuck in the outbox, but it didn't provide a satisfactory explanation.

After communicating with a representative from a UK company called IXON, BryanG learned that they have no immediate plans to switch to a subscription payment model. Although he remains cautious due to past experiences, BryanG acknowledges that this offer is currently the best option available and is £100 cheaper than the previous provider.

BryanG reflected on his past experience with a client-to-client VPN system, which required a Netgear VPN Router and a public facing IP address. However, with most devices now connecting via private IP addresses on the mobile network, this setup may not be feasible. Additionally, the shift towards subscription-based Dynamic DNS services has added to the complexity and cost of maintaining a VPN network.

To address these challenges, BryanG recommended looking into Tailscale, a secure remote access solution based on WireGuard®️ technology. With Tailscale, users can establish secure connections between devices on any infrastructure according to zero trust principles. Despite the initial complexity, BryanG found Tailscale to be a cost-effective solution at $18 per year for up to 100 devices.

However, BryanG acknowledged the limitation of using a PC as a connection point for large customers, as they often require a dedicated device with enhanced security measures. This highlights the need for specialized hardware to address security concerns in remote connections.</p>

            <p>Cloud services come with a price tag. It is common for new hardware sales to eventually stop supporting the costs of current systems, leading companies to explore alternative business models. For instance, Netflix has reached a saturation point with new subscribers in the USA and must find other avenues to increase revenue and achieve profitability. Similarly, Uber initially offered low rates to gain market share, but has been gradually increasing prices in an effort to become profitable in the future. It's important to remember that any free service may eventually require payment or have hidden costs. This is why I recommend considering private cloud solutions. By hosting services on your own server, you have control over costs and do not have to rely on third-party infrastructure. If the demand for your services grows to the point where you need to scale up your server, it is a problem worth celebrating as it is a result of your success.</p>

            <p>I am grateful that my main clients are equipped with contractor VPN access using Cisco Anywhere, which saves me from incurring any additional costs for remote access. Setting up remote access for OEM machines can be a challenging task. However, for smaller tasks, I prefer using Teams and establishing remote access to an electrician's laptop.</p>

            <p>When I first began utilizing e*w*o*n, the price per device was £1000, which included a generous amount of free 'cloud' storage. However, cloud services do come with costs. Can you justify charging £1000 per year for VPN outside of an antivirus bundle when you can get unlimited VPN for just £2.00 per month elsewhere? Personally, I would have no issue if e*w*o*n reduced their annual fee to £20. Additionally, if they raised device prices to £700 but offered future VPN services for free, I would be content. Despite using e*w*o*n since 2009 and observing that they have not gone bankrupt, it is evident that they have been profitable.</p>

            <p>BryanG mentioned in a conversation that he received a two-year subscription to a virus protection package with unlimited VPN service for up to five devices, priced at approximately £2.00 per year per device. He questioned how another service justifies charging £1000 per year. After exchanging emails with a representative from the service provider, BryanG felt the explanation provided was unsatisfactory.

In a discussion with a UK IXON representative, BryanG learned that there are no immediate plans to switch to a subscription payment model. Despite some reservations, he found the current offer to be the best available option, saving him £100 compared to his previous service provider. BryanG speculated that many users may soon sell their old devices online.

Years ago, BryanG experimented with a client-to-client VPN system using a Netgear VPN Router, but found the setup cumbersome. One challenge of standard VPN services is the requirement for a public-facing IP address, which can be costly. BryanG's devices often connect via mobile networks, which assign private IP addresses, creating compatibility concerns with traditional VPN setups.

BryanG recommended exploring Tailscale, a secure internet connectivity solution that offers flexible configurations and end-to-end encryption. Priced at $18 per year for up to 100 devices, Tailscale seemed promising for BryanG's needs. He suggested running Tailscale on an industrial Raspberry Pi for optimal performance.

Moving forward, BryanG planned to switch to a Teltonika router for VPN access, as it offered seamless connection to the RMS cloud. He opted for a data package covering 150GB for 10 years, costing only £30. The Teltonika setup seemed more cost-effective and user-friendly compared to his current service provider.

For those interested in RMS solutions in the UK, BryanG recommended exploring Teltonika RUT140 Industrial Ethernet Router as a budget-friendly option. Additionally, BryanG shared a helpful YouTube video demonstrating VPN setup for RMS gateway to Siemens kit using the RUT240 router.

In conclusion, BryanG expressed intention to test Tailscale further when time permits, and planned to replace his existing devices with Teltonika routers, potentially selling the old ones on eBay. For the best deals on RMS solutions in the UK, BryanG suggested checking out specific suppliers for affordable options.</p>

            <p>I am currently experiencing challenges with H M S's new subscription plans and fully align with BryanG's sentiments regarding their behavior. To address this issue, I successfully migrated my development E*w*o*n to a cloud-based OpenVPN service provided by C*l*o*u*d*C*o*n*n*e*x*a using a complimentary account. I followed a comprehensive guide by B*o*s*c*h R*e*x*r*o*t*h to facilitate this transition (link excluded to adhere to forum guidelines). This provider ensures that the free account, which allows for up to three simultaneous connections, will remain free indefinitely, which meets my needs perfectly. The allocated connections are based on active devices rather than configured devices, allowing flexibility for multiple E*w*o*n devices to be set up and connected as needed. Additionally, B*o*s*c*h R*e*x*r*o*t*h provides a guide on managing device pools and user access rights within the same service. While I have not yet tested this feature, it offers valuable insights for future use. In the event more than three connections are necessitated, there are alternative providers offering competitively priced cloud-based OpenVPN solutions.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After some experimentation, I discovered that in order to set up a VPN connection with C*l*o*u*d*C*o*n*n*e*x*a, the keys and certificates need to be extracted from the .ovpn file and saved separately. Various filters can be applied to avoid warnings, and the key and certificate sections must be edited to reference the separate files. Additionally, the default .ovpn file provided by C*l*o*u*d*C*o*n*n*e*x*a may need adjustments, such as removing the first three lines containing setenv and variable assignments/comments.

To implement these changes, I transferred the .ovpn file, client key, client certificate, and CA certificate to the /usr folder on the E*w*o*n device via FTP. I then updated the VPN connection settings to point to mynetworkname.openvpn.com as the primary server and specified the path to the .ovpn file in the configuration settings. Following these steps, the E*w*o*n device successfully established a connection using the C*l*o*u*d*C*o*n*n*e*x*a OpenVPN client, providing full access to LAN nodes.</p>

            <p>Have you encountered challenges when trying to connect multiple eWons to a third-party OpenVPN server? I recently had to refresh a similar setup from 2010, but faced issues with expired certificates. While using an older version of OpenVPN, I found that some devices did not support the necessary hash algorithm. Despite this, I was able to successfully connect several older Flexys devices to a standard Windows PC with an OpenVPN server. Keep in mind that while eWons are not ideal for self-hosted VPN servers, there are more cost-effective options available.</p>

            <p>In a manual from 2009 (yes, I collect operating manuals), my office used to be cluttered with hard copies before the age of hard drives and PDFs. The VPN (Virtual Private Network) feature of the **** enables you to establish a secure connection to your **** over the Internet. This connection can be a direct link between your PC and the **** (using eCatcher with or without Talk2M), a direct connection between two ****'s, or a full VPN network connecting multiple ****'s and PC's. The ****'s VPN solutions aim to simplify the integration process for users.
The availability of more affordable options like e*w*o*n has rendered the 2005CD setup obsolete for self-hosted VPN servers. Despite this, there are numerous eWONs available on eBay, with the cheapest 2005CD priced at £28.00. If you're interested in experimenting, it's worth considering. Personally, I find that using a self-operated OpenVPN system poses security challenges beyond my expertise. When connecting industrial control systems to the Internet, ensuring utmost security is crucial. This is why outsourcing, such as using eWON or IXON, is my preferred choice.</p>

            <p>Best of luck with transitioning to IXON, it appears to be a reliable solution. It is also on my list of potential options. As someone not well-versed in this area, I wholeheartedly agree that prioritizing IT security measures is crucial. For me, T*e*l*t*o*n*i*c*a RMS and C*l*o*u*d*C*o*n*n*e*x*a seem quite similar; both are cloud-based OpenVPN services, with the latter being more generalized and not tied to specific hardware. Initially, I had reservations about cloud-based OpenVPN services, but after coming across B*o*s*c*h R*e*x*r*o*t*hs' guides, I decided to give it a try as they seemed to consider it safe enough. However, it is important to note that there are no guarantees. There are several alternatives available for remote access, as previously mentioned, but finding a comprehensive solution that encompasses remote access, built-in IO servers, custom scripting, email/SMS alerts, custom reports, logging, locally hosted web-based HMI/dashboards, and modular IO can be challenging. The new subscription plans from H M S will surely be well-received by other remote access device suppliers.</p>

            <p>The introduction of H M S's new subscription plans is bound to receive a warm reception from competitors in the remote access device industry. While the free version of IXON surpasses e WON's free version in terms of Remote Access and Users control, it lacks features such as IO servers, custom scripting, email/SMS alarms, custom reports, logging, locally hosted web-based HMI/dashboards, and modular IO. These advanced features are available in IXON's paid version. Fortunately, not everyone requires these extra features. IXON offers the ability to stay connected to machines and customers through its Industrial IoT platform, which provides integrated remote access and scalability from machine to cloud. However, access to all features may require opting for the Professional Plan priced at 3500 Euros per year. Alternatively, users can choose to integrate a RaspberryPi running Node-Red to access these features while sticking to the free version of the platform. Ultimately, selecting the right plan depends on individual needs and preferences.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the helpful tips! Prior to the recent subscription plan update, the extensive list of features, such as puls SMS command/status requests (which slipped my mind), were readily available for free on the F*l*e*x*y platform. I have utilized these features in various combinations on multiple machines, utilizing an HMI hosted on the device itself to eliminate the need for a constant internet connection. Consequently, these machines can be efficiently controlled by a PLC and a F*l*e*x*y without the necessity of a dedicated HMI panel. It seems that IXON mandates a cloud connection for accessing the dashboards, which may pose challenges in low connectivity areas.</p>
