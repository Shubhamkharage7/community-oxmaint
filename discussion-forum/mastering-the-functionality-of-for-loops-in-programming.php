                    <p>I have been attempting to understand the functionality of FOR loops and how they can be utilized. Typically, FOR loops are used for iterating over data, resetting arrays, and performing repetitive tasks. While I have created a FOR loop, I find it challenging to comprehend. For example, when running a loop from 0 to 300 with an increment of 0.1, the loop actually stops at 301. It is important to understand the behavior and syntax of FOR loops to effectively utilize them in programming.</p>

            <p>A FOR loop, as the name implies, is a repetitive structure that allows you to execute code multiple times without the need for manual repetition. It is essential for automating tasks that need to be done sequentially. In this case, it is important to ensure that the loop stops when it reaches the value of #loop1, which should be set at 300. Have you declared the local variables as temporary or static within the loop?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The for loop runs from 0 to 300, resulting in a total of 301 executions. This ensures that the loop iterates through all values between 0 and 300 inclusively.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If a condition is not specified before the FOR loop, it will execute every iteration. To avoid this, consider adding a condition before the FOR loop, such as IF condition THEN FOR #loop1 := 0 TO 300 DO #inc := #inc + 0.1; #count := #inc; END_FOR; END_IF. This will help control the execution flow and prevent unnecessary scans.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Utilizing a FOR loop becomes essential when accessing elements within the loop using an indexing variable. The example provided initially is not a good representation of efficient coding practices. It includes redundant steps and unnecessary complexity.

For instance, instead of the initial code snippet:

IF condition THEN
 #inc := 0;
 FOR #loop1 := 0 TO 300 DO
  #inc := #inc + 0.1;
  #count := #inc;
 END_FOR;
 condition := FALSE;
END_IF

A more streamlined and effective version of this code would be:

IF condition THEN
 #count := 30.1;
 condition := FALSE;
END_IF;

Furthermore, a clearer and more illustrative illustration of a practical FOR loop usage would be:

IF condition THEN
  #hits := 0;
  FOR #i := 0 TO 300 DO
   #Bool_array_1[i] := #Bool_array_2[i] AND NOT #Bool_array_3[i+1];
   IF Bool_array_1[i] THEN
    #hits := #hits + 1;
   END_IF;
  END_FOR;
 condition := FALSE;
END_IF

In this refined example, the FOR loop iterates through an array, manipulating its elements based on the conditions set by other arrays. It also demonstrates how to efficiently manage array indices and count the occurrences of specific values within an array. This improved version showcases a more practical and concise approach to utilizing FOR loops in programming.</p>

            <p>While I have grasped the basics of FOR loops, I find it challenging to keep up with their speed. Nevertheless, I appreciate all the support I have received. It is exciting to explore a new approach to text formatting instead of traditional blocks. The code snippet below showcases my progress in utilizing FOR loops efficiently, performing tasks such as mirroring values and clearing arrays. 

In the code snippet, a condition checks whether to start or reset the loop based on the values of #startloop and #resetarray. If #startloop is true and #resetarray is false, the loop iterates through indices 0 to 9, incrementing values and mirroring arrays. Once the loop is completed, #startloop is set to false. On the other hand, if #resetarray is true and #startloop is false, another loop resets the arrays to 0 before setting #resetarray to false. 

By mastering these concepts, I am enhancing my skills in handling FOR loops and efficiently managing data structures.</p>

            <p>Swedeleaner inquired about the potential uses of loops, such as data manipulation and array resetting. Common applications of loops also include implementing iterative algorithms for converting instantaneous measurements into more relevant values, like in a binary search or non-linear models without exact formulas. It is important to note that loops should not be used for sampling data within a single scan cycle of a PLC; the PLC scan cycle itself should be utilized for that purpose.

For example, consider a scenario where a PID controller is being used to regulate the level of a tank with a noisy level signal. If fixing the root cause of the noise is not feasible, applying a filter to the process value (PV) to improve the perception of the level and PID behavior is an alternative solution. A moving average filter can be implemented by using a timer, an array, and a FOR loop to calculate the average of the twenty most recent PV values over a specific time interval.

While some PLC brands offer built-in FIFO and average instructions, implementing a moving average filter without these features can be achieved using a timer, array, index, and FOR loop. This method allows for effective data processing and manipulation within the PLC system.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is important to always specify the SIZE when working with arrays to avoid potential issues down the line. Hardcoding the length can lead to problems, especially if the array is modified. Here is an example of a typical loop structure: 

``` 
SIZE(array, 0, length); 
FOR dx := 0 TO length - 1 DO 
``` 

By following this approach, you can ensure that the controller functions properly even as the array is adjusted.</p>

            <p>Implementing loops serves several common purposes in programming, such as converting instantaneous measurements and other values into more useful forms through iterative algorithms like binary searches or non-linear models. It is essential to note that loops should not be utilized to sample data over time within a single scan cycle of a PLC. Instead, the PLC scan cycle itself, which functions as a loop, should be used for this purpose. One example provided by @JesperMP involves a scenario where a PID controller is used to regulate the level of a tank with a noisy level signal, leading to unstable control and frequent replacement of valve positioners. In such cases where addressing the root cause of the problem is not feasible, applying a filter to the process variable (PV) can help improve the control perception and behavior of the PID. A moving average filter, with a time constant of a few seconds, can effectively smooth out the noisy signal and enhance control performance. The provided code snippet illustrates the implementation of a moving average filter in a PLC program using a timer, array, index, and a FOR loop. While some PLC brands may offer built-in functions for FIFO, average, or moving average calculations, the manual implementation demonstrated here is a viable alternative for those without such functionalities. If you are looking to understand the specifics of the average filter, @drbitboy can guide you through the process, addressing questions regarding the addition of latest_PV to PV_sum, the initialization of loop_index, shifting values in the array last_20_PVs, populating PV_sum with values from the array, and adding the latest measurement to the array.</p>

            <p>The value of the loop can vary depending on the range you set it to, such as from 0 to 19 or 10 to 29. When working with an array of [0..19], it's important to note that there are 20 variables in total. Starting the loop at 1 may not be ideal since the array is configured from 0 to 19. It's recommended to set the loop from 1 to 19 if needed, but adjust the index accordingly by subtracting 1, like My_Array[loop - 1] := My_array[loop]. 

To avoid errors, it's advisable to make the array one size larger than the index. This ensures that if mistakes are made during testing, the program won't crash immediately. However, debugging may be slightly more challenging if unexpected results occur. Keep in mind that the loop value will be one higher than the set range, such as reaching 20 after looping through 0 to 19.</p>

            <p>When using loops in programming, the value can vary depending on the range specified. For instance, a loop can be set from 0 to 19 or from 10 to 29. It's important to consider the starting index when working with arrays. For example, if you have an array with a range of [0..19], there are actually 20 variables starting from 0. Starting the loop at 1 may not be ideal in this case. It's recommended to set the loop from 1 to 19 and adjust the array index accordingly. By making the array one size larger than the index, you can avoid potential errors during testing. Keep in mind that the loop value will increment by one after completion. Be mindful of the range you specify when using FOR loops to ensure the desired results.</p>

            <p>The error in the loop parameters (from limits 1 to 19 to 0 to 18) has been identified and corrected. In the context of the Last_20_PVs array with indices [0..19], the latest_PV value should be assigned to Last_20_PVs[19], not Last_20_PVs[20]. 

swedeleaner seeks guidance on the average filter from @drbitboy. Clarification is requested on the addition of latest_PV to PV_Sum, where the 19 values are summed and the latest_PV makes it the 20th value.

To clarify, the value of latest_PV initializes PV_Sum before the loop. A suggestion is made to initialize the value of PV_Sum to 0.0 before the loop, sum the nineteen array elements from 0 through 18 inside the loop, and finally add the value of the 20th element (Last_20_PVs[19]) after the loop.

Regarding the FOR Loop, it should start from 0 to 18. The initial shift from Last_20_PVs[1] to Last_20_PVs[0] continues until index 19, with updated values in indices 1 to 18. 

PV_Sum is not filled but summed with the most recent past values from the array, specifically from indices 0 to 18.

Lastly, the measurement value of latest_PV should be assigned to Last_20_PVs[19] within the array, as the indices should be [0..19].</p>

            <p>As reiterated by others, FOR loops are essential for processing tasks within a single PLC scan, especially when dealing with constraints such as input filtering or data manipulation. It is important to note that if a FOR loop is extensive and only triggered occasionally (by an IF condition), it can potentially impact the scan time of the routine or task. While this may not be a concern for modern PLCs, it is something to be mindful of when using older generation PLCs. Stay vigilant about the efficiency of your process to ensure optimal performance.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Why does a FOR loop stop at 301 when running from 0 to 300 with an increment of 0.1?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - In programming, when using floating-point numbers and incrementing by a decimal value like 0.1, there can be precision issues that lead to unexpected results. This is due to how floating-point numbers are represented in computer memory, which can result in rounding errors accumulating over multiple iterations and causing the loop to stop at a slightly higher value than expected.</p>
