                    <p>Hello, I am a beginner user of Wonderware HMI Software and I am currently working on interfacing it with a CTI (formerly Siemens) 505 PLC running Workshop Software. I am looking for resources such as videos, manuals, etc. on how to create tags for the 505 PLC. The approach they are taking is to minimize costs by optimizing tag usage in Wonderware.

            <p>I have completed many tasks related to this topic, which is actually quite straightforward. TI uses specific identifiers for different data types: 
- Booleans are represented as Cxxx in both TI and WW
- Integers are depicted as Vxxx in TI and WW, or as signed values, Vxxx:S
- Floats are stored as two consecutive V values and are displayed as Vxxx in both TI and WW
- Constants are denoted as Kxxx
- It is possible to manipulate bits within the range of Vxxx.1 to Vxxx.16, but caution is advised due to the different bit numbering conventions in TI (16 to 1 from least significant bit to most significant bit) and Rockwell (0 to 15). Most TI drivers compensate for this discrepancy but employ a different syntax in Wonderware. For example, V1000.5 in TI is equivalent to V1000:5 in Wonderware. Using the wrong syntax may lead to confusion, such as V1000.0 in Wonderware corresponding to V1000.16 in TI.
- Other address formats include X (inputs), Y (outputs), WX (analog inputs), and WY (analog outputs), which remain consistent between TI and WW
- Timer and Counter presets are labeled as TCPxxx, while Timer and Counter actual values are referred to as TCCxxx
- It is essential to note that timers in TI count down, while timers in Rockwell count up.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your assistance. I am becoming more acquainted with the CTI 505 platform and its addresses, but I am struggling to understand how the 505 addresses are displayed in Wonderware. It appears that my company did not invest in the package that facilitates communication with the 505. I apologize for any incorrect terminology I may be using. It seems there are several steps involved in locating the address (Tag) within the 505. Thank you once again for your help.</p>

            <p>Cydog expressed gratitude for the assistance in navigating the CTI 505 platform and understanding addresses. However, there is confusion about how 505 addresses are represented in Wonderware without the necessary communication bridging package. Despite the lack of utilizing the correct terminology, there are steps involved in locating the address (Tag) within the 505. Furthermore, only a few IO servers are known, including the original TIDIR, SoftShops 505 server, and Kepware, all using similar syntax.</p>

            <p>Thank you, sir. I have another question regarding a Special Function in a V430 system. The V430 is designated as a Scaled Result within this particular SF. This variable appears only once in the SF. Typically, where would you scale an analog input or network value? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>SFPGM features a Scale and Unscale command for analog inputs and outputs. The Scale command is commonly used to convert a WX analog input signal from 0 to 32000 (or 20% offset for 4-20ma) to Engineering units stored in a variable. On the other hand, the Unscale command is used for Analog Outputs to convert a variable to a WY Analog output signal.

In the case of TI analog devices, such as the 505 style, the typical range is 0 to 32000 for 0 to 10v or 4-20ma signals. If using E200 IO on profibus, the usual range is 0 to 16384 or 0 to 24768 for scaling, which is achieved through mathematical calculations in SFPGM.

Temperature measurements from Thermocouples and RTDs are usually obtained by dividing the straight temperature by 10 to derive a single significant digit. If the V430 is only displayed in the SFPGM and not elsewhere, it is likely being shown on a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) screen.</p>

            <p>Good afternoon, sir. Apologies for the inconvenience, but I have a query regarding the installation of a new CTI 2558 Analog Input Card. I have addressed the analog inputs beginning with WX 1145 (Input 1), WX 1146 (Input 2), etc. I am currently using a Fluke 715 Calibrator, however, I am encountering an issue where the Data Window in 505 Workshop only displays 0 U16. My question is, do newly installed cards require activation or enabling? Your assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>To properly configure your PLC system, make sure to access the PLC Utilities and PLC Configuration. In the 505 I/O configuration, add the module by editing the correct slot and setting WX to 8, with an IO Address of 1145. It is essential to avoid using addresses 1145 to 1152 for any other IO configuration, including WX, WY, X, Y, or Profibus I/O.

Additionally, for the CTI 2558 module, ensure that the jumpers on the side are correctly set for either current or voltage inputs to match your wiring and signal requirements.</p>
