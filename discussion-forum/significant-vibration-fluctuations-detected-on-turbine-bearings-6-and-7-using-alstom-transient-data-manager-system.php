                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>After starting up on July 27, 2024, significant fluctuations in vibration trends were detected on bearings # 6 and 7 of the Turbine/Generator, along with minor fluctuations on bearings # 1, 4, and 5, using the ALSTOM Transient Data Manager/ Turbine Diagnostic System (TDM). These fluctuations were observed on the X and Y Relative probes of the TDM system, but not on the Vibro VM600 TSI system in the main control room.

The vibrations were present even at zero speed and during turning gear operation at 2~3 rpm. Major fluctuations with amplitudes between 150 µm to 240 µm were noted at regular intervals on bearings # 6 and 7, with exceptions of no or minor fluctuations during night hours. Minor vibrations between 10µm to 20 µm were also observed on bearings # 1, 4, and 5.

The vibration frequency of peaks at bearings # 6 and 7, measured by the X and Y probes, ranged from 270Hz (5.4x) to 570Hz (11.4x), with side bands visible in the waterfall plots. It is crucial to diagnose the fault based on this data, as the fluctuations are only apparent on the diagnostic system and not on the TSI system.</p>

            <p>If you are experiencing fluctuations at zero RPM, it may not be true vibration. It is recommended to verify the integrity of the sensors and check for any nearby sources of noise that could be causing the issue. Make sure to investigate and address any potential factors that may be influencing the fluctuations.

Subject: Analysis of Vibration Trends and Peaks on 340 MWe Steam Turbine Bearings# 6 and 7 at ALSTOM TDM System

Observing substantial fluctuations in vibration trends at Bearings # 6 and 7, and minor variations at Bearings # 1, 4 & 5 on the ALSTOM Transient Data Manager (TDM) System post-startup on 27th July, 2024. These fluctuations are specifically seen on X & Y relative probes of the TDM system. Interestingly, these erratic vibrations are also present at zero speed and during the operation of the turning gear at 2~3 RPM.

The significant fluctuations on Bearings # 6 and 7 exhibit amplitudes ranging between 150 µm to 240 µm at regular intervals, with occasional exceptions during night hours where minimal to no fluctuations are detected. Similarly, minor fluctuations between 10µm to 20 µm can be seen on Bearings # 1, 4, and 5. The vibration frequency at Bearings # 6 and 7 ranges from 270Hz (5.4x) to 570Hz (11.4x) on both X & Y probes, with side bands visible in the waterfall plots.

It is crucial to analyze all available data to pinpoint the root cause of these fluctuations, as they are solely visible on the diagnostic system and not on the TSI system. Your attention to this matter is highly appreciated.

            <p>When analyzing fluctuations in vibration trends, spectrum, and orbit plots on 340 MWe Steam Turbine Bearings #6 and #7 in the ALSTOM Transient Data Manager (TDM) System, it is crucial to consider the possibility of noise interfering with the signal. Issues can arise from the instrument loop or the target area on the shaft, so it is essential to investigate if there is a correlation between changes in vibration and other parameters like the axial position of the shaft. To further diagnose the issue, additional plots at 0 rpm and 3 rpm (slow roll) can provide valuable insights. One practical test to consider is swapping the cables of the vibration probes at the back of the rack to observe any effects. However, it is essential to conduct a risk analysis and adhere to facility policies before making any changes. Regards- Ali M Al-Shurafa.</p>

            <p>When experiencing fluctuations in vibration trends, spectrum, and orbit plots on a 340 MWe steam turbine's bearings #6 and #7 at ALSTOM's Transient Data Manager (TDM) System, it is important to address potential grounding errors. False vibration instrument readings are often caused by electrical currents induced in the system. To troubleshoot this issue, ensure that proximeters are properly grounded according to OEM guidelines. Check the junction box's main grounding wire for tight adherence and absence of oil or varnish at connections. Additionally, inspect the main grounding element going into the ground for any voltage buildup. Technicians should perform a voltage check on the junction box metal and Copper ground element at the earthing level, ensuring that the voltage does not exceed 0.01 Volts. It is also crucial to consider AC wiring induced currents by separating vibration wiring from AC conducting wires in cable trays, following instrumentation standards for proper separation distances. Lastly, investigate rotor-induced electrical currents, such as electrical shaft currents in the turbine rotor or high rotor magnetism above 5 Gauss in the shaft or casing. By conducting these checks, you can identify and address any underlying issues affecting vibration trends on the turbine bearings. For further analysis and recommendations on diagnosing the fault based on available data, reach out with your findings. Remember to consult with experts for accurate troubleshooting and maintenance strategies.</p>

            <p>Hello, I hope you are all having a great day. I wanted to share some valuable insights based on the previously posted recommendations. When experiencing fluctuations in vibration data, it is important to consider potential external sources such as noise or shaft voltage. One common issue that can contribute to these fluctuations is the lack of proper shaft grounding brushes. Additionally, damaged signal cable wiring from the Vibration data collector rack to the field device proximitor and the extension lead to the probe can also be sources of the problem.

To troubleshoot this issue, conducting a megger test on the cable from the Rack to proximitor (with proximitor disconnected) can help determine if the cable is healthy or damaged. It is also recommended to check the extension probe lead and replace any old type proximitors that may be causing issues. It is important to ensure proper grounding of proximiters and check for any electrical currents induced by AC wiring or rotor magnetism in the turbine rotor.

By addressing these potential sources of error and conducting thorough checks, we can pinpoint and resolve the fluctuations in vibration trends observed on the Turbine Bearings. Your attention to these details will contribute to the efficiency and reliability of the system. Thank you for your dedication and commitment to maintaining optimal performance.

            <p>While reviewing the information provided, it is unclear whether this is the initial startup of the TG and its technical condition monitoring system, or if it is a post-overhaul startup. The product ALSPA CARE is from several years ago, indicating that this may not be the first startup. Comparing data from the VM600 system and the diagnostic system (fluctuations) is not meaningful without information on the measurement frequency band in the VM600. The presence of electrical noise in the diagnostic system data suggests potential issues with connections, external EM noise, or internal damage in the monitoring system. It is possible that the problem lies with the company that installed the system components or connected the VM600 to the diagnostic system. Changes in connections or signal cables may have occurred during the shutdown if such effects were not present before the July 27 startup. The fluctuations shown in the analyses are unlikely to be caused by rotor dynamics, as the TG set's dynamics are deemed to be in good condition.

            <p>Hello Dr. Ryszard Nowicki, I concur with your insights regarding the fluctuations observed in vibration trends on the 340 MWe Steam Turbine Bearings #6 and #7 at ALSTOM. I have reached out to Muhammad Musa to request additional data, such as gap voltage trending or swapping DAU channels to further isolate the issue. Unfortunately, I have not yet received a response. It appears that the issue may be related to ground connections, external EM noise, or internal damage in the monitoring system. It is crucial to address these potential causes to resolve the fluctuations seen in the diagnostic system. If the issue arose after a recent start-up, it indicates a change in connections or signal cables during the shutdown. The dynamic performance of the TG set seems to be unaffected by these fluctuations. For comprehensive assistance in diagnosing the fault, it is essential to analyze all available data. Please feel free to reach out if further support is needed. Thank you. Xuye Yin Turboservice.</p>

            <p>Dear Xuye Yin,

After reviewing the data provided, I have a strong suspicion that the change in signal nature from non-contact sensors is due to noise. However, I am uncertain about the primary cause of this noise based on the data. As the Co-Creator of the ALSPA system, I hope for a swift resolution to the issue and would appreciate more details on the nature of the noise.

Upon reviewing the data, it seems that the fluctuations in vibration trends may be attributed to external factors such as electrical noise or connection issues. It is likely not a problem with the rotor dynamics, but rather an issue with the monitoring system setup. To resolve this, it's important to inspect the system components and connections made during the setup.

            <p>Yesterday, Dr. Ryszard Nowicki received a response from Muhammad Musa regarding the fluctuations in vibration trends on the 340 MWe Steam Turbine Bearings #6 and #7 at the ALSTOM Transient Data Manager (TDM) System. The gap voltages remained unchanged, and a loose connection in the DAU system wiring was checked and found to be okay. Initial work on the grounding system was completed with no clear fault identified yet. Dr. Nowicki suspects potential damage in the DAU box, possibly due to loose connections between cards or damaged chips. To differentiate whether the issue lies within the DAU box or externally, signal channels can be swapped from the terminal block. If the problem persists with the channels, it implicates the DAU box; if it transfers with the signals, the issue is external. The disturbance at a low frequency range with varying frequencies suggests a likelihood of the issue being with the box, although grounding problems and external noise should also be considered. Xuye, an ISO18436-2 Cat.III vibration analyst, can be reached at xuye.yin@outlook.com for further assistance.

Subject: Vibration Issues on Steam Turbine Bearings at ALSTOM TDM System

Greetings Dr. Ryszard Nowicki,

Regarding the vibrations on Turbine Bearings #6 and #7 at ALSTOM TDM System, Muhammad Musa suggested a check on gap voltages and confirmed no issues with DAU system wiring. Grounding system work has been completed with no fault found yet. A possibility of damage in the DAU box or loose connections between cards/chips was mentioned. To differentiate between internal and external issues, swopping signal channels was recommended.

The disturbance at a low frequency range with varying frequencies suggests a problem with the DAU box. The grounding issue and external noise must also be considered. Xuye Yin, an ISO18436-2 Cat.III vibration analyst, xuye.yin@outlook.com.

For any additional data or clarification, feel free to reach out.

Looking at the data provided, it seems that noise may be the cause of signal changes from non-contact sensors. But without more information, it's difficult to pinpoint the primary source of this noise. I hope for a quick resolution to this issue and eagerly await further updates on the nature of the noise.

Warm regards,

If this is a recurring issue since a recent start-up, possible causes could include incorrect connections, external EM noise, or internal damage in the monitoring system. It's crucial to examine changes made during maintenance or installation post-startup to identify the root of the fluctuations. Rest assured, these vibrations are likely not related to rotor dynamics.

Muhammad Musa reported major vibrations on turbine bearings #6 and #7 after startup on July 27, 2024, with fluctuations only observed on the TDM system, not the TSI system. The analysis shows variations in vibration trends at specific intervals, especially at night. The frequency of vibration peaks ranges from 270Hz to 570Hz on bearings #6 and #7. Assistance in diagnosing the fault based on available data is requested.

Looking forward to resolving these vibration issues together.

Sincerely,
Muhammad Musa</p>
