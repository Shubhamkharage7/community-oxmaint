                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am experienced in working with Allen Bradley systems and recently encountered an issue while using Factory Talk View Machine Edition. Despite my experience, I have never been asked to create users via the runtime before. I added buttons on the HMI for "adding user" and "adding/removing users to groups" in order to create a new user named 2 with a basic password and assign them to the "administrators" group. However, when attempting to log in as user 2, I encountered a login denied error. Can anyone provide insight into why this may be happening? Thank you, Kevin.</p>
