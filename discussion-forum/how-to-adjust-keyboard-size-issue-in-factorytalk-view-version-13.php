                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am encountering a problem with the FactoryTalk keyboard size when using Version 13 compared to Version 10. In Version 10, the keyboard fits perfectly on the screen, but in Version 13, it appears too large and doesn't fit. This issue is causing difficulties for operators trying to log in. Despite my attempts to adjust the size settings, I have been unsuccessful. Is there a solution to this problem? It seems like it may not be possible to transfer the keyboard from Version 10 to Version 13. (I appreciate the constant software improvements by Rockwell Automation).I would appreciate any help or suggestions. Thank you.</p>

            <p>To access panel view configurations, you can either use the button on the HMI or access it through a restart and by navigating to the HMI's settings. Start by checking the default font size and making any necessary adjustments. Look for options related to resolution and keyboard type, although these settings are usually found in the software rather than the panel view configuration. Experiment with rotating the display by 180 or 90 degrees to see if it resolves any glitches. It's worth noting that machines that appear identical may be rotated by 180 degrees. I always find troubleshooting these issues to be an interesting and enjoyable challenge.</p>

            <p>To optimize your viewing experience on Windows, consider adjusting the text size to a smaller setting. In Windows 10, navigate to Start, then go to Settings > Accessibility > Text Size. This simple change can improve readability and overall usability of your device.</p>

            <p>It appears that Accessibility settings are not available in Windows 10 but are present in Windows 11. However, in Windows 10, you can adjust the font size in the Advanced Display settings. I tried reducing the font size from 9 to 8 in headers and displays, but unfortunately, it did not affect the FactoryTalk View pop-up keyboard. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>During some free time, I decided to do a fresh installation of Windows 10 and added FactoryTalk View Ver. 10, where the keyboard displayed the correct size. However, after another clean installation of Windows 10 and the installation of FactoryTalk View Ver. 13, the same project showed a keyboard that was too large. This issue seems to be specific to FactoryTalk View 13, rather than a Windows setting. Despite searching, I have yet to find any options within FTView to adjust the keyboard size. Can anyone provide guidance on where to find these settings?</p>

            <p>The keyboard settings are linked to a GFX file located in the directory (C:\Users\Public\Documents\RSView Enterprise\ME\Libraries) and are not customizable. It is possible that resolution differences between the Windows PC screens or in the runtime file settings may be causing the issue. I recommend verifying the resolution settings on both devices and checking the configuration in the HMI file. Please note that I am using ME, so the specific settings may vary for SE users, but they should be available somewhere within the system.</p>

            <p>After performing a clean Windows installation and importing a project in FTView 10 on my computer, the keyboard size was just right. However, after another fresh Windows install and importing the same project in FTView 13 (which automatically converts from version 10), the keyboard no longer fits on the screen. It seems that Rockwell developers may have enlarged the keyboard for better usability on touchscreens.</p>
