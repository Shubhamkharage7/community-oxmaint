            <p>congngu inquired about assistance with establishing communication between Python and a Mitsubishi PLC Fx3G via USB or RS422. Unfortunately, there is a lack of available tutorials on this topic. Mitsubishi has not disclosed the communication protocol for its RS422 programming port, leading to challenges in establishing connections. Some HMI or SCADA systems have been able to communicate through reverse engineering, but they are often limited to 9600 baud. To overcome this limitation, attaching an RS485 Modbus slave module to the PLC and utilizing the Modbus protocol is recommended. It may be beneficial to explore alternative communication methods due to the constraints imposed by Mitsubishi's restrictions on faster communication speeds.</p>

            <p>The Mitsubishi protocol has not been publicly released, as stated by Ife. While the FX5 may have different settings, the FX3 programming port typically defaults to 9,600 on power up. However, the programming software will attempt various rates before forcing the PLC to communicate at the rate defined in the software IDE. A few years ago, I encountered this issue and set up an Ethernet to 422 converter to connect to some FX PLCs on our network. It worked successfully at 115kb, but would default back to 9600 after a power cycle. Despite seeing a lot of communication traffic during connection, I did not have the time to decode it. It is possible to manually set the programming port to a different configuration. The FX5 model does not support 422, but instead uses 485 and Ethernet. Therefore, Ethernet is the recommended choice with no need to adjust the baud rate settings.</p>

            <p>In my exploration to enhance connection speeds with GXDeveloper, I observed that the software initially reads two D8000 registers from the PLC before writing values to additional D8000 registers. However, despite my efforts, I was unable to uncover the specific operations used to calculate the seconds values based on the initial inputs. This intricate process remains a mystery to me.</p>

            <p>Indeed, there are registers within the 8000 range similar to those utilized for the 232/422/485 BD card. These registers allow you to configure specific modes for the card. To access these registers, you may need to identify the correct addresses and values for the programming port. It is possible that you will need to decode the codes sent in order to locate the addresses, as they may not have a clear function outlined in the documentation for the special registers.</p>
