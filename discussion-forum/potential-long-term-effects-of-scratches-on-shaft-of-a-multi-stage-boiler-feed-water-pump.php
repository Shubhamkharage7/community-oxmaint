                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, I am reaching out regarding a concern with one of our multi-stage boiler feed water pumps. During the assembly process, we noticed 3-4 scratch marks at the NDE seal seating area. While the runout at these points is within acceptable limits, I am concerned about the potential long-term effects on the pump's performance. I am wondering how quickly these scratches will deteriorate and if we will need to replace the shaft at the next available opportunity. Additionally, I am concerned about the possibility of premature seal failure due to these scratches. The NDE seal has a sleeve, but I am unsure if it can adequately protect the shaft surface from failure.</p>

            <p>Jatan, providing more detailed descriptions, including photos and sketches, would greatly assist us. It is important to specify the location, depth, and number of scratches, as well as the seal face diameter and shaft speed. It would be beneficial to know the total runout at the seal face and the wear rings' runout and clearance. Additionally, clarity on the purpose of the sleeve in protecting the shaft is needed. Addressing the scratches promptly is crucial to prevent issues with other parts. Have you considered polishing and deburring the scratched area? Understanding the cause of the scratches is also important.</p>

            <p>Hey Vee, this shaft is brand new, so scratches may have occurred during the assembly process of wear rings and impellers, or while taking run out measurements. The run out on the wear area measures 0.03 mm, well within design limits. The machine operates at a speed of 2970 rpm. These marks are not grooves, but rather scratch marks similar to those made by a scriber on a metal surface. The seal diameter is unknown to me, as this is a cartridge seal with an o-ring between the sleeve and shaft. All seals, bearings, and o-rings are new. I will update you with a photograph soon.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jatan. I have organized my questions in bullet points for clarity, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could address each question by its corresponding number. To reiterate the unanswered questions: 1. Can you specify the location and quantity of scratches on the surface? 2. What is the diameter of the seal face? Additionally, could you provide the sleeve diameter for reference? 4. What is the precise total runout measurement at the seal face? 5. I require further clarification regarding your inquiry about protecting the shaft - specifically, what potential threats are you looking to prevent?</p>

            <p>If you possess the necessary skills, it would be beneficial to analyze the impact of scratches on the data collected. This can be done by examining the raw signal in the time domain at a slow roll speed, typically around 200 to 300 RPM. By using proximity probes and the right instrumentation, you can observe the effects of scratches on the signal. Additionally, utilizing an oscilloscope may help in interpreting the data if you have the expertise. It is important to note that attempting to remove scratches with a file wrapped in emery cloth could potentially create flat spots on the shaft, which are harder to detect in the data. Identifying scratches is relatively straightforward, while flat spots pose a greater challenge. - John from PA</p>

            <p>After examining the mechanical seal area at the non-drive end (NDE), it was found that there are 3-4 scratches where the rotating face sits. These scratches do not come into contact with the O-rings of the seal. The seal diameter is 75mm while the sleeve diameter is 55mm. The actual runout on the seal face area is measured at 0.03mm. 

My concern is whether the sleeve will cover the scratch area and prevent friction on the shaft during normal operation. It is important to note that this pump does not have an online condition monitoring system and the shaft is new. The seal faces installed are also new and arranged in a cartridge setup. I hope this addresses your query. If you require further information or data, please feel free to reach out.</p>

            <p>Hey John, unfortunately, this pump does not come equipped with an online condition monitoring system or any shaft probes. We conducted offline vibration measurements on the new shaft, and the results were within acceptable limits. No repairs or maintenance was needed as everything done on the pump has been documented in my previous posts.</p>

            <p>Considering the specifications provided: quote: 2. The seal diameter is 75 mm, while the sleeve diameter measures 55 mm. 4. The actual runout on the seal face area is 0.03 mm, resulting in a transverse sliding motion between the seal faces with each revolution of the shaft. This movement equates to about 90 mm per minute or 5400 mm per hour, totaling up to 40 km over a year. The oil film present during normal operation helps protect the seal faces, but the shear action generates heat. Moreover, during each start, the seal faces may experience dry rubbing. If a weekly changeover takes approximately 20 seconds to build the oil film, there could be dry rubbing for around 3 meters. Therefore, wear from pump starts and heat damage during starts and regular operation are expected. Prior to discussing the scratches, a cross section of the seal is needed for further evaluation.</p>

            <p>Hello @vee, it is important to remember that the seal plan consists of the numbers 41 and 62, and the seal is quenched before every start and stop. This ensures that the seal will not run dry during these processes. I will also be providing you with the construction drawing for your reference.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Jatan, Quenching will not prevent the seal from running dry, causing the oil film to be squeezed out when the seal is not in motion and there is no axial force to keep the seal faces separated until it begins moving again. This can lead to temporary dryness and potential damage to the seal.</p>
