            <p>We are currently facing challenges with a client due to significant gaps in their documentation on asset criticality. This lack of information is hindering our ability to recommend any maintenance actions. Should we leave it as is or implement an online monitoring system? At the moment, our decisions are based on informal assessments relying on tribal knowledge. Conducting a detailed study would be costly, so we are seeking advice from experienced employees like Joe and Bill, who have been with the company for 39 years. However, the question remains - what criteria are they using to determine what is truly important for the business?</p>
