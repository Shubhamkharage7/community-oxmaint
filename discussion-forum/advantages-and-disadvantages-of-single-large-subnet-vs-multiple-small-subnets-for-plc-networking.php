            <p>Expanding subnets can lead to increased network traffic, potentially impacting I/O updates. To mitigate this, consider using a managed switch to regulate network traffic for individual devices, offering a simpler solution compared to managing multiple gateways.</p>

            <p>For beginners, it is recommended to start with 192.168.1.x local IP addresses and 255.255.255.0 subnets. Subnets are often altered for job security reasons, but they are not as complex as they may seem. A subnet acts as a checkpoint between the IP address and Gateway. If you have the authority, you can easily connect different subnets in the future. However, if you lack control over this decision, it is a good idea to expand the subnets. When facing traffic challenges, it is important to inquire about the numbers involved. Automation equipment typically plays a small role in the vast expanse of TCPIP network.*importance varies based on context*</p>

            <p>Subnets are commonly utilized to reduce broadcast traffic on a network, creating smaller broadcast domains. By dividing a network with 400 devices into four subnets of 100 devices each, the broadcast messages are limited to a smaller group of devices within each subnet. This can help improve network performance by preventing excessive broadcasts from impacting all devices.

Adjusting the subnet mask can increase the maximum available devices on a network, although it results in creating larger broadcast domains. This modification is a cost-effective and simple solution that does not require additional hardware. However, ensuring that all users are using the modified mask can be challenging.

It is important to manage broadcasts, as they are received by every device on a subnet and can affect network efficiency. Multicast messages, similar to broadcasts, can also be controlled with the right "Managed" ethernet switches. Without proper management, multicast messages can flood a network with unnecessary traffic, impacting overall performance.

To prevent broadcasts from crossing subnets, devices can be segmented into different subnets. Communication between devices on different subnets can still occur with the use of a router or Layer 3 switch. Planning and communication with IT experts are essential when restructuring a network with multiple subnets to ensure seamless functionality.</p>

            <p>By adjusting your subnet mask from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.254.0, you can increase the number of available IPs from 253 to 509. Transitioning to a more restrictive subnet mask can improve network efficiency and prevent potential outages. For multiple subnets connected to a gateway, it is advisable to keep them on the same subnet for optimal performance, especially for remote I/O connections requiring low latency. Switching to a more stringent subnet mask can enhance network stability and prevent disruptions in case of gateway failures.</p>

            <p>If you have 254 devices on a single network, consider physically segregating your network for better performance, especially when dealing with PLCs. While all PLCs and HMIs can share a network, it's beneficial to isolate their IO and Drives on local machine networks connected to the controlling PLC. This approach can prevent troubleshooting and maintenance issues that arise when all IO devices are placed on a plantwide IO network.</p>

            <p>I advocate for equipping each machine with its own dedicated industrial switch containing its PLC, HMI(s), and I/O Modules. By consolidating all components onto one switch and connecting it to a central switch with a single network cable, you ensure uninterrupted machine operation even if the main network fails. This approach not only enhances operational reliability but also streamlines network connectivity and cabling.</p>

            <p>I believe that each machine should have its own dedicated industrial switch, complete with its own PLC, HMI, and I/O modules all connected to the same switch. This setup ensures that the machine can continue running independently even if the main network fails, and it also simplifies network cabling. I do prefer to have all PLCs and Scada-type HMIs on a single plant network for better interoperability, with isolated machine control HMIs like a PanelView on the machine network. This arrangement makes it easier to share data through produce/consume methods, tag multiple PLCs to a single HMI, and collect data efficiently without the need for managed switches or complex routing. In our designs, most CLX racks have at least two ENxts, sometimes three, with one for the plant network, one for I/O, and potentially a third for motion/CIP depending on complexity. Even if the main network goes down, all operations can continue running smoothly. It is essential for each machine to operate independently of the HMI in case of communication failures, but in some cases, environmental regulations may necessitate shutting down the process after a certain period of unresolved issues.</p>

            <p>A network with multiple switches can still have all devices on the same subnet, allowing easy accessibility from any network socket. The star topology of a network switch system simplifies wiring and improves connectivity.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the world of networking, having multiple switches doesn't mean devices have to be on separate subnets. By using a network switch star topology, wiring becomes much simpler and all devices on the same subnet can be easily accessed from any network socket. However, one downside of this setup is the limitation to 254 devices on the same subnet. So, how do you effectively interconnect multiple PLCs and isolate each PLC's I/O when they are all on the same subnet? While star topology has its limitations, such as losing one cable resulting in the loss of a device or multiple devices if connected to a switch, many are now transitioning to a ring topology for more reliable connectivity and redundancy in their networks.</p>

            <p>The size of a subnet is not restricted to 254 devices, as it is determined by the network mask rather than the configuration of switches or cabling. By using a subnet mask of 255.255.254.0/23, there will be 510 available IPs. Opting for a mask of 255.255.252.0/22 will increase the number of IPs to 1022, allowing for efficient network operation.</p>

            <p>According to lfe, the size of a subnet is not limited to 254 devices. The size of a subnet is determined by the network mask, not by the arrangement of the switches or cabling. For example, with a 255.255.254.0/23 mask, there are 510 available IPs. Increasing the mask to 255.255.252.0/22 allows for 1022 IPs, creating a network that can still operate at high speed. It's important to consider network isolation to prevent a single failed device from compromising the entire network with repetitive broadcasts.</p>
