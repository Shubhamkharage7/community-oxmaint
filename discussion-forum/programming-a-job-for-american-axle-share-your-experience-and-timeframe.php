                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am seeking information on programming a job for American Axle. Can anyone share their experience with this process? How much additional time did it take to complete the project? How long did it take for you to feel confident and comfortable with the task? I recently received training from their corporate team but ended up being assigned to a different project. Currently, I am estimating a new job for a plant located in Ramos, which was previously known as an old Metaldyne plant and is now following the corporate AAM standards.</p>

            <p>For the most recent project I completed for American Axle, I received their standardized PLC + HMI design template for the machine prior to its shipment to one of their newly acquired plants near Leon. Although the template was intended for assembly, I chose not to adhere strictly to it as it was better suited for that purpose rather than manufacturing. In line with my experience with GM projects, I recommend budgeting double or even triple the estimated time for completion to ensure compliance standards are met. This advice is based on feedback from a colleague who has also worked with American Axle in the past.</p>

            <p>When it comes to corporate software specifications, I excel at doubling and providing straight quotes for hardware specs with one round of revisions. However, I have encountered challenges with software specifications. Often, you will not be in direct communication with the original software author, but instead collaborate with a new corporate programmer to decipher and make sense of it. This process can be complex and requires careful navigation.</p>

            <p>When dealing with a corporation, make sure to request their standard scope of work document outlining the required components for electrical, pneumatic, electrical, and hydraulic systems. This step is essential to avoid any discrepancies with the client's specifications and prevent costly design changes or programming revisions. I learned this lesson the hard way when a client rejected the components I used in their plant. So, always double-check and confirm the approved components beforehand to avoid unexpected expenses and delays. - James</p>
