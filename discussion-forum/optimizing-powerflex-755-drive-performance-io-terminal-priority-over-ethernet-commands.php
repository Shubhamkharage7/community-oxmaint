                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am facing a unique challenge in running a PF755 from the IO over ethernet, which presents its own set of obstacles. The system is integrated into a multi-stage exhaust fan setup for emergency equipment, where I need the hard-wired system to always override ethernet commands. However, the issue arises when an ethernet connection may not be reliable. I require the IO terminals to take precedence over EIP commands in controlling the drive's speed at either 20 Hz or 60 Hz using interposing relays. Despite having an emergency override for a single speed, I am exploring options to ensure the IO terminals override ethernet control smoothly.

I have sought advice from Rockwell support and considered using Devicelogix to manipulate parameters for a more predictable drive behavior. By masking off certain sources using the 32x parameters, I aim to prioritize DI logic commands over ethernet speed references. The goal is to seamlessly integrate the drive into our control system while ensuring that the IO always overrides ethernet commands without direct intervention in the PLC programming. Testing will be crucial to verify the effectiveness of these adjustments and address any potential issues that may arise.

While there may be alternative approaches to achieving the desired outcome, I am committed to finding a solution that aligns with the current system setup. Any suggestions or insights from fellow members would be greatly appreciated as I work towards optimizing the drive's performance and reliability in this unique scenario.</p>

            <p>The Allen-Bradley 755 drives offer the convenience of DeviceLogix programming for PLC functions, located in slot 14. An example of this feature in action is a site using two PF755 drives to control a dredger's slew operation. These drives can be configured as either a master or a slave, or operate independently, all controlled through DeviceLogix programming. Each drive is equipped with multiple IO cards for enhanced functionality.</p>

            <p>I previously utilized a similar approach with a PowerFlex 525, though it has been some time. If I recall correctly, I employed the purge function for setting up the hardwired run controls.

            <p>ASF explained that one of their requirements was setting a digital input for the purge function at a frequency of 50Hz. In purge mode, the purge frequency takes precedence over other speed references. This functionality is specific to the PF525, although it is likely to be similar in the 755. The challenge lies in dealing with multiple frequencies in the override, making it difficult to adjust the frequency within the purge function.</p>

            <p>I wanted to provide an update on the emergency override feature. Unfortunately, it will only be accessible once firmware 14 is installed. In the meantime, I may opt to use bitmasking. However, upon further reflection, I have decided to simply integrate the new devices into the IO tree and deactivate the old ones. I will address cleanup during our scheduled downtime.</p>

            <p>As I continue to update my project, I am pleased with the results I have achieved. I successfully implemented full HMI alarming and control without compromising the functionality of the original hard-wired system. Through the process, I discovered valuable lessons that I would like to share.

One important aspect was the need for a firmware upgrade to version 14.x, which allowed me to avoid updating the firmware on my EN2T card. This upgrade introduced a new parameter, P345: Start on Power-Up, enabling me to utilize run edge and have the drive restart in case of a power cycle while running from the IO terminals.

During my discussions with experts at Rockwell, I uncovered some key insights regarding the drive's operation. Regardless of the source, the drive will stop if certain conditions are met, such as Emergency over-ride mode or using the run level. To ensure the drive continues running, the stop signal must be deactivated, and the run command must be toggled. Using the onboard relay for non-life-safety applications is possible, but caution is needed as these contacts are not low power contacts and may not be suitable for all scenarios.

The DeviceLogix functionality of the drives involves programming an onboard controller and assigning IO parameters for data links to the actual IO values in the drive. It is crucial to ensure that the types match for seamless operation. Integrating DI's and DOP's into DLX, linking them to drive parameters, and implementing logic for various scenarios, such as Ethernet stops or miswiring issues, proved to be essential for optimizing drive performance.

Despite encountering challenges such as CCW crashes and data loss during testing, I found DLX to be a powerful tool with immense potential for enhancing system functionality. By incorporating datalinks to monitor DOP and DIN status words and setting up alarms for detection of miswiring, I was able to create a robust and reliable system.</p>
