                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Yesterday, we experienced a Processor Failure which led us to open a new Processor, only to find that BootP was not functioning properly with it. After hours of troubleshooting, we stumbled upon a loose Processor in a drawer, which surprisingly worked on the first attempt. However, the model we are using (1769-L35E) is now considered obsolete. Our local AB distributor has recommended upgrading to the 5069-L320ER. 

We are wondering if the conversion process will be as simple as changing the controller in the project file or if it will require more extensive work. Our current setup includes 24vdc, 120 relay, and Analog I/O, along with 2 1769-AENTR Point I/O racks. We also have a similar machine with 2 (1734-ADN) Point I/O DeviceNet racks.

Our OEM has offered the last available (1769-L35E) for $16K, causing us to consider alternative options for a backup plan. Any assistance from this community would be highly valued as we navigate this transition.</p>

            <p>One of the easiest ways to upgrade from the L35E is by utilizing the 1769-L33ER controller. This option allows for a seamless transition without the need to adjust the I/O in the chassis. If opting for the 5069 series, you will need to either convert the existing chassis I/O to 5069 I/O (which can be challenging) or install a 1769-AENTR module to connect the chassis I/O to Ethernet. It is essential to ensure that you have at least RSLogix5000 v20, as this is the minimum firmware version supported by the L33ER controller. It is important to note that Point I/O modules belong to the 1734 series, not the 1769 series.</p>

            <p>The distributor is honing in on the specific CPU part number, while the OEM is aiming to maintain their reserve of exact-match stock. Let me share an anecdote involving the PLC-4 and its role with the US Navy. I concur that opting for the 1769-L33ER (or a model with higher memory capacity) is the optimal decision, provided the application does not rely on the serial port. The POINT I/O, DeviceNet scanner, and other components will function seamlessly with it, just as they did with the 1769-L35E.</p>

            <p>The Serial Port was previously utilized with a Modem but has since been disconnected. Further research will be done on the 1769-L33ER, which appears to be a promising option based on initial findings. A quick online search revealed that it is priced at 25% less than the original quote from our OEM. Thank you for your assistance and input.</p>

            <p>I have upgraded multiple L35 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) with the newer L33ER model, a simple swap with the same I/O capabilities. The L33ER boasts increased memory and a faster processor, resulting in significant performance enhancements. I experienced a remarkable difference in one application where the L35 was struggling - online edits that previously took minutes now happen in seconds. The upgrade truly transformed the system's efficiency.</p>

            <p>If you prefer to stick with your current system, we can fix the L35e for you to have a reliable backup. Sending both units will give you two backups, ensuring long-term peace of mind. While others may suggest changing components, your success with the L35e speaks for itself. Take advantage of our complimentary quotes by emailing us at [email protected] to learn more.</p>
