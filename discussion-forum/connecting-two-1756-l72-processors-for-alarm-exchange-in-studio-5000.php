                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently in the process of establishing a connection between two 1756-L72 processors for the purpose of exchanging alarms. One processor is running on rev 26.13 while the other is on rev 32.11. They were initially on different networks but have now been linked at a central point within the control room. By adjusting the IP address, it is possible to access both processors from a single PC. To ensure they are on the same network, I added an EN2T to one of the processors and connected it to an available port on the nearby Stratix switch.

While using Linx, I can observe the connection between the processors through their respective IP configurations. However, I am facing difficulties in adding them to the controller tree in Studio as they are not communicating effectively. In the 26.13 project, I encountered a problem where the revision required to add the processor to the controller tree was missing. In the 32.11 project, the processor does not appear when attempting to discover devices.

It is essential to take note that both versions of the software are running on the same computer within the control room, making it a straightforward task to adjust the IP addresses for connectivity. My goal is to streamline the project path to avoid changing the IPs repeatedly in the future. If anyone has insights on what could be missing in this setup, I would greatly appreciate your input.</p>

            <p>If you are able to successfully ping both devices using the same ethernet connection, it indicates that there is data routing between them. You should be able to manually establish the producer in the PLC's tree that is receiving the data, even if it is not an exact match in terms of PLC type or firmware. What truly matters is the structure of communication, specifically how the data is being transmitted to the PLC - whether through the CPU ports or via the network card. Browsing is not essential as this process can be carried out offline without the need for a network connection.</p>

            <p>In terms of data routing between devices, it is crucial to ensure that both can be pinged from the same ethernet connection. Manually creating the producer in the PLC tree that is receiving the data is key, regardless of an exact match in PLC type or firmware. The focus should be on the structure of communication and how the data reaches the PLC, whether through CPU ports or a network card. Browsing is not necessary as this can be done offline with no network connection. Understanding the system setup, such as having separate software instances instead of versions through studio, is essential for successful connectivity. Connecting to the processor through administrator and Windows XP sp3 may require specific configurations, but ensuring the correct revisions and communication protocols are in place is paramount for smooth operations.</p>
