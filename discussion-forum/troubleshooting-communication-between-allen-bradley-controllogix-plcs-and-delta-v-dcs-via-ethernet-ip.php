                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently working on establishing communication between ControlLogix PLCs and Delta V DCS through EtherNet/IP. A VIM2 card has been set up to support EtherNet/IP devices. According to Mynah's knowledge base, the VIM2 is capable of Class 1 (I/O) connections with ControlLogix PLCs, using the 1756-ENBT format. Each ENBT corresponds to a VIM dataset, specifically designed for simplex VIM architecture.

I have successfully configured 3 PLCs with the DCS, although they were never simultaneously connected due to plant maintenance. Upon restart and simultaneous connection of all 3 PLCs, communication errors with the DCS occurred. Troubleshooting revealed seamless communication with the DCS when only one ControlLogix PLC is connected, but issues arise when multiple PLCs are connected simultaneously. Troubleshooting efforts are ongoing, and communication is restored only when all but one PLC is connected, and the cable is reinserted.

I have verified the network for duplicate IP addresses but found none. Is there something I may be overlooking? My experience with the Delta V DCS is limited. Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Are you currently employed by Emerson or are you the end user of their systems? Emerson's support contracts can be costly and comprehensive; do you have one in place? In my past experience, I found that a Mynah VIM set to default update rates could overload the communication capacity of a 1756-ENBT with Class 3 tag reads and writes. The "inter-scan delay" feature of the Mynah did not function properly, causing constant requests and limiting control. However, it has been 15 years since I last worked with them, so improvements may have been made by now. How are the Class 1 connections configured exactly? Do the Mynah VIM2's appear as Generic Modules in the ControlLogix I/O tree, or as I/O modules with a 1756-ENBT acting as an adapter? Are you using traditional 1756-ENBTs or newer models like the 1756-EN2T or -EN3T? 

If you have three PLCs attempting to establish connections with a DCS as an "adapter"/"target", does the VIM2 differentiate them based on the source IP address or through other means like the CIP Slot Number? Monitor the I/O connection status in Studio 5000 and check for any error codes using GSV instructions. If possible, set up a mirror port on a managed switch and use Wireshark to capture data, as this could provide valuable insights.</p>
