                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Currently, I am in the process of developing new classifications for our electrical/mechanical departments. I have outlined specific criteria for each level within the groups, but I am seeking additional insight to help me further refine these classifications. The electrical and mechanical groups have been segmented into 4 levels, ranging from trainee to master. I have noticed variations in maintenance group guidelines at different plants, with some plants providing detailed descriptions of requirements at each level and the steps needed to progress to the next level. Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance in advance.</p>

            <p>I have not received a response yet, but I would like to provide some insights. Are these classifications (also known as competencies) intended for craftsmen or executives? To ensure clarity, both roles would require proficiency in various disciplines. While it may be simpler to define levels for craftsmen, determining executive technical competency levels requires specialized expertise in specific areas such as static, rotating, piping, control systems, field instruments, and electrical systems. Properly defining these levels involves careful consideration and in-depth knowledge. This may explain the lack of responses, which could be due to confidentiality, lack of information, or limited adoption in the industry.</p>

            <p>Hello Mike, I recommend checking out the best practices in maintenance management as outlined in Terry Wiermann's Benchmarking Best Practices book, specifically on pages 64 to 84. This resource contains numerous innovative ideas that can greatly benefit your maintenance operations. I truly believe in the value of this information and am not promoting it for any other reason.</p>
