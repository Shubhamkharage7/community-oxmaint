            <p>Are you currently in RUN or Monitor mode? It appears that the cards contain replaceable relays that are known for being unreliable. If you see an orange relay removal tool attached to the back of the card, you can use it to remove the small black cube relays after taking off the side plate. Be sure to keep the pins aligned properly. If a relay has failed, you can replace it with a spare output relay or use one temporarily for testing if only one output is not functioning. If none of the outputs are working, it may be best to wait for further troubleshooting assistance.</p>

            <p>I am currently in run or monitor mode, and although the LEDs on the output module are working correctly, the relays are not removable. I have attempted to troubleshoot by testing different modules, but unfortunately, the relays are still not functioning as expected.</p>

            <p>If the indicators are functioning fine except for the relays, it's important to check the contacts. These contacts can be found as either AB or common on A8, among others. To test them, create a brief program to switch them every 0.1 second. By doing this, you should be able to audibly verify their operation. This troubleshooting method will help ensure the proper functioning of the contacts.</p>

            <p>The PLC in use is the CJ1M-CPU11 model with power input from a PD022 module. I have removed all input modules, leaving only the OC211 module connected. After clearing the memory, I have initiated a new program with coils designed to activate with the power supply. The Run LED is displaying green, while no other LEDs are illuminated on the CPU. The LEDs on the output module are showing yellow. Despite this, there is no clicking sound and no voltage detected between Com and any of the outputs. I am starting to suspect that the CPU may be damaged, but I am puzzled as to why the LEDs are functioning while the coils remain inactive.</p>

            <p>I may be mistaken, but when testing from COM to the output, make sure you are connecting the test leads to points with different potentials. You require a variance in potential to accurately measure voltage. Instead of connecting one tester lead to the COM terminal, try connecting it to the other side of the control transformer or power supply. Refer to the diagram below for clarification.</p>

They inquired about the reference Jxx Ch1 and expressed confusion about terminal designations, not being familiar with Omron.

            <p>It's been a while since I last used an Omron, but here are my observations on common issues. 1. Check for incorrect wiring. 2. The relays in Omron devices have a high 1,000,000 cycle life, but they can wear out or the contact arm may fail over time. 3. Solid state outputs are rated for a specific amperage, so exceeding this limit with a surge or run current could result in burning the output out. Make sure to conduct proper maintenance to avoid these issues. Regards, James.</p>

            <p>Hello James, I am working on a new setup where most of the loads are minor, such as LED lights. The relays I have are brand new and haven't been used yet because I'm unable to establish a proper connection. It has been suggested that the issue may be due to the lack of power to drive the coils on the bus, but I'm unsure how to test for this. Can you provide guidance on troubleshooting power issues in a relay setup like mine? Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When checking for voltage between the common terminal and the outputs, as well as for continuity, there were no readings. I asked about the Jxx address in case I had entered it incorrectly, but I have confirmed that is not the issue and have removed it. Referring to the diagram provided, the common terminal on the output module is connected to a 24v source. I am conducting tests between 0v and outputs A0 to A7 and B0 to B7. It seems you are communicating clearly, but I am considering different backgrounds and trying to eliminate common mistakes.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After reviewing the manual further, I have one additional suggestion to try before giving up. Please activate output #1 and check for continuity between A0 and B0. Then, deactivate output #1 and verify if continuity is no longer present. While this may seem like a long shot, it's worth exploring even if it feels like guesswork.

Additionally, consider the possibility that the model number of the card is incorrect, which could explain the issues you are experiencing. Verify if the model number is not OD211 or OC201. If this is not the case, then you may be facing a unique situation. Good luck with troubleshooting.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you are ready, let's proceed with the following steps:

1. First, remove all modules from the plc to start fresh.
2. Clear the program and create a basic test program to ensure the cpu is functioning properly.
3. Install the module in question, which I believe to be a relay module, and disconnect all wiring.
4. Integrate a code to test one of the outputs.
5. Switch off the output and use an ohm meter to test the contacts (A8 (com) to A0-A7 or B8 (com) to B0-B7) to confirm they are open.
6. Activate the output and test the contact again. There should be zero ohms. If everything is connected correctly and working, you should notice a change in ohms.

When it comes to wiring, assuming the plc module will be powering the device:

1. Connect the AC (L1 line) or DC+ to the Com terminals.
2. When the outputs are activated, the contacts will close to provide power to the device.
3. Connect one side of the device to outputs A0-A7 or B0-B7.

For AC power, the wiring is not critical, but for DC power, follow the instructions carefully.
4. Connect the other side of the device to AC neutral or DC common.

I have explained the steps in basic terms to ensure clarity. Thank you, James.</p>

            <p>Hello James, I have completed all necessary steps and am currently testing with only the CPU and output module connected. I have erased the memory and uploaded a program that specifically triggers relays 1 to 4. Despite these efforts, I am encountering the same issues. There may be a configuration issue or possibly damaged hardware causing the problem. I have tested multiple output modules, all of which have shown the same results. It is important to note that all equipment is brand new. While I am new to PLC programming, I have experience with electrical systems. It is perplexing that the indicator LEDs are functioning properly, indicating that the CPU is transmitting the correct instructions, yet the coil remains unenergized. Could there be a BIOS setting affecting this issue?</p>

            <p>If there is a removable wiring connector that connects to the front of the output card, try disconnecting all wiring from the connector. Use an ohmmeter to test the continuity between the COM and relay output terminal(s). Make sure to check for any issues with the connector itself by removing it and checking for any damage or seated pins. It is important to inspect all connectors for bent or retracted pins. Make sure everything is properly connected and that a conductive termination connector may be required. If there is no continuity between the COM and output contacts, do not connect a load at this time.</p>

            <p>To improve your Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system, consider replacing the faulty relay with an unused one. If you're not comfortable with soldering, consult an electrician for assistance. Alternatively, you can reconfigure the PLC online by changing the address of the faulty relay to match the unused relay. Then, rewire the connections from the faulty relay to the new one for optimal performance.</p>

It's important to note - are you also utilizing a CJ1W-TER01 Terminating End Cover on the right side of the Output module during testing? This component is essential for properly terminating the bus. Make sure to include this in your setup for successful testing. Thanks for sharing, George.</p>
