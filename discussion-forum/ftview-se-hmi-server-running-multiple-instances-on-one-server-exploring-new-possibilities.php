                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have always believed that only one HMI server is allowed per physical or virtual server. However, in testing some FTView upgrades on a non-live system without data servers, I created a test system with two HMI servers on the same physical server, each serving a separate application area. This setup surprised me as I thought it was not permitted. 

I am unsure if this is a recent change or if I have misunderstood something. Typically, I would use a single HMI server for small unrelated systems with all the displays organized in a flat file structure. However, the ability to have each system as its own HMI server poses some interesting possibilities, though I am not sure of the advantages it may offer. It may result in more overhead, but it does provide flexibility, especially when trying to merge two small systems on individual servers into a single server.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is officially possible to host two HMI Servers on one machine, enabling each computer to serve as a redundant backup for the other. For instance, Computer A can act as the primary server for Area A and the backup for Area B, while Computer B can be the primary server for Area B and the backup for Area A. Despite Rockwell Automation suggesting a limit of two servers for performance reasons, there is no definitive restriction on the number of HMI Servers that can be hosted on a single machine.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Can multiple instances of FTView SE HMI Server run on one physical or virtual server?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Yes, it is possible to have multiple instances of the FTView SE HMI Server running on the same physical or virtual server, as observed by the user in the discussion thread.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Is running multiple HMI servers on a single server a recent change in FTView SE?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - It is unclear if this capability is a recent change or if it has always been possible. The user in the discussion thread was surprised by the setup and questioned if they had misunderstood the limitations.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What are the advantages of running separate HMI servers for different application areas?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Running separate HMI servers for different application areas can provide flexibility, especially when merging small systems from individual servers into a single server. However, it may result in increased overhead compared to using a single HMI server for all systems.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. How does organizing systems with separate HMI servers impact system performance?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While having separate HMI servers may offer flexibility, it is important to consider the potential impact on system performance due to increased overhead. Users should weigh the advantages of flexibility against the resource implications.</p>
