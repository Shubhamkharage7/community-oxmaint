            <p>It has been a while since I worked with Omron, but based on my understanding, you can send data when input 0.03 is activated (onshot), which then sets a value in D10 after Timer 1. This value is used for comparison and triggers the second transmission. Timer 2 resets the process before starting over. I recommend using the timer 1 contact to enable the second logic, which should achieve the same outcome. You may want to remove timer 1 from the first transmit function to avoid overlap. Additionally, the extra moves may not be necessary.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I noticed that you attempted something similar in a previous post using one timer, but I suggest trying to use two timers as I mentioned earlier. This may require some additional time for transmitting data. Are you familiar with any user bits or registers that indicate when a transmission is complete? In Mitsubishi systems, there are standard variables available to verify if operations have finished. Additionally, when you trigger a send, are you confirming that data is actually being sent?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I prefer using a single timer instead of cascading multiple timers. What if we set the TXD instruction to require only a one-shot pulse (one scan cycle of its input rung being True)? Additionally, I have discovered that the MOVs should be replaced with a transfer of 3 words (6 bytes) to DXX, which should be a simple fix. There is currently no second delay after the first timer expires, but if necessary, it can easily be added.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If the timers function similarly to malfunctioning IEC timers in TIA portal, such as |-| T001 yielding True or |/| T001 yielding False within one scan cycle before the TIM instruction is assessed in that same cycle, then the T001 output value must be transferred to a separate bit unrelated to the timer. Otherwise, the second trigger may fail to occur, potentially explaining the original code's lack of functionality.</p>

            <p>I recommend thoroughly reading through this manual on the Omron CP2E model, which can be found at https://assets.omron.eu/downloads/manual/en/v1/cp2e_instructions_reference_manual_en.pdf. Make sure to include the A392.05 "Send ready flag" on the TXD line. Additionally, I noticed that there is a #100 in the control - is this intended?</p>

            <p>Incorporating A392.05 "Send ready flag" into the TXD line note is crucial for efficient communication during rs232c serial comm. Confirming the control word, which should be 100, is also essential for proper functionality. Make sure to thoroughly review the manual provided by Omron for comprehensive guidance on these configurations: https://assets.omron.eu/downloads/manual/en/v1/cp2e_instructions_reference_manual_en.pdf.</p>

            <p>drbitboy mentioned a preference for avoiding cascading multiple timers when a single timer could suffice. Considering this, the code assumes that the TXD instruction only requires a single pulse (lasting one scan cycle of its input rung being True). Furthermore, it was realized that the MOV instructions should be replaced with something that can transfer 3 words (equivalent to 6 bytes) to DXX, which is a simple task. While the code does not include a second delay after the first timer expires, adding one if necessary should also be straightforward. Overall, this code proved to be quite helpful, with the MOV successfully replaced by XFER to achieve the desired outcome. Thank you.</p>
