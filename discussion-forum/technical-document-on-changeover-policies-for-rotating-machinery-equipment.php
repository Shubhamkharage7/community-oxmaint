            <p>Resonance could be the underlying issue, but what are the acceptable operating parameters established by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)? Surely, after producing numerous towers, the OEM has developed these parameters. Cooling tower structures and fans are prone to geometric deviations and harmonics unique to their design, which may not be present in other equipment. Modern vibration technology can detect even the smallest deviations. In the past, periodic inspections were conducted for fan hardware, blade pitch, and gears, with monitoring limited to an "earthquake" switch in case of extreme vibration. Today, advancements allow for better detection of deviations, although some may not pose a problem. Just like medical tests can detect issues, the solution may not always be clear. Food for thought!

The operation team shared the changeover plan with the support of teams 2 and 3, while the machinery team shared concerns with the Condition Monitoring team regarding monitoring requirements based on criticality levels.

            <p>When selecting a monitoring system for redundant machines, it is crucial to consider the criticality of each machine individually. The choice of monitoring system may vary depending on the criticality level of each machine, which can be determined using historical reliability data on the types of damage and their progression over time within your company. The interpretation of "critical machine" can differ significantly among companies, highlighting the need for a tailored approach to monitoring and protection systems. Platforms like AMP FORUM may not always provide the necessary details of production assets to make informed decisions. Differentiating between machines like pumps and fans, with varying designs and operations, is essential for creating effective monitoring systems. While you have outlined your requirements, more specific information about the situation is needed for tailored recommendations. Best of luck with your decision-making process. RN.</p>

            <p>When it comes to monitoring systems for machines, it is essential to tailor them to the specific criticality of each machine, including redundant ones. The decision on the monitoring system for redundant machines with varying criticality levels may differ based on historical data about reliability, types of damage, and their evolution over time in your company. Understanding the concept of a "critical machine" can vary greatly among companies, leading to differing opinions on the matter. While platforms like AMP FORUM may seem suitable for showcasing production asset details, the uniqueness of machines like pumps and fans require specific monitoring systems tailored to their design and operation. Without specific details about your situation, it is challenging to provide recommendations.
