                    <p>Greetings, At our facility, we currently utilize a Reformer Furnace manufactured by Foster Wheeler. Recent inspections have revealed bowing in certain catalyst tubes of the reformer, indicating potential creep formation. We are seeking insights and experiences from others who have encountered similar issues. Additionally, we are interested in learning about non-destructive examinations (NDE) that could assist in assessing the severity of creep. Your input is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Dear MHR, we would appreciate if you could provide more details on the vertical tubes of the furnace. Specifically, we are looking for information on the diameter, wall thickness, length, and materials of construction. Additionally, we are interested in the bottom fired aspect of the furnace - how many burners are present and how are they balanced? It would also be helpful to know the furnace temperature, nominal tube wall temperature, and actual peak temperatures. 

We need to know if all tubes are bowed or if they are in isolated groups and at what elevation this occurs. Can you also provide details on the number of tube inspections conducted since first start up and whether there was any bowing observed during previous inspections? 

Lastly, do tube diameters get measured during inspections and are there any noticeable trends? If possible, please provide a cross section and a plan view. If you have not already consulted with Foster Wheeler, it may be beneficial to do so as they may also have additional questions that require preparation in advance.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are the common causes of bowing in catalyst tubes of a Reformer Furnace?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Bowing in catalyst tubes of a Reformer Furnace can be caused by factors such as high operating temperatures, thermal stresses, material properties, and potential creep formation.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can bowing in catalyst tubes be identified during inspections?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Bowed catalyst tubes can be identified during routine inspections by visually observing the deformation or using measurements to detect the extent of bowing.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What are the implications of creep formation in catalyst tubes?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Creep formation in catalyst tubes can lead to deformation, reduced structural integrity, and potential failure, impacting the performance and safety of the Reformer Furnace.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. What non-destructive examinations (NDE) techniques can be used to assess the severity of creep in catalyst tubes?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Non-destructive examinations such as ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, and eddy current testing can be utilized to assess the severity of creep in catalyst tubes without causing damage to the tubes.</p>
