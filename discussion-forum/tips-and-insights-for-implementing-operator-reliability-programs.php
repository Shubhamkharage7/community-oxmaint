            <p>For those who have implemented an ODR program, I have a few questions for you. What types of equipment do you monitor in your program? We are interested in including rotating equipment and equipment under pressure. What specific parameters do you typically include in your monitoring routes? For rotating equipment, do you monitor vibration levels, temperature, general equipment status, seal condition, and pressures? How do you define parameters for static equipment? How long does it typically take to complete one monitoring route, and how often do you perform these routes? I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide some examples of monitoring routes and any supporting documentation. Thank you in advance for your assistance, and I eagerly await your valuable feedback.</p>

            <p>Are your operators conducting routine maintenance rounds in designated plant units or sectional processes? Do they perform basic equipment care, quick fixes, adjustments, cleaning, lubrication, and participate in equipment ownership programs on the spot as needed? Will you establish proper equipment duty/standby options or rotate them as desired? Will operators have access to hand-held tools? Ultimately, will operators take the lead on reliability programs like Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) in collaboration with other departments?</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, I agree with you. The plant operators are currently conducting their regular walkdowns and performing quick maintenance tasks such as adjustments, cleaning, and lubrication. However, we plan to enhance their routine by implementing a sustainable program that includes data collection. This program will involve training sessions and specific routes with alerts for equipment maintenance. Thank you for your input.</p>
