            <p>If you're searching for answers, check out the Mitsi programming manuals. It seems like H0010 and H1100 represent hexadecimal versions of decimal constants K16 and K4352 (= K4096 + K256 = H0100 + H0010). They may be using hexadecimal due to the unique meanings assigned to the bit positions in the BFM#21 and BFM#8 targets, making decimal values unclear.</p>

            <p>drbitboy suggested checking the Mitsi programming manuals for information on hexadecimal and decimal literal constant representations. It is possible that H0010 and H1100 correspond to the decimal values K16 and K4352, respectively. This may be because the bit positions in the targets BFM#21 and BFM#8 have specific individual meanings that are not related to binary integers, making the use of decimal values unclear. If you need to adjust the offset or gain for CH1 or CH3, you may need to input data in K8&9 H****. Can you provide guidance on what data should be entered in these locations?</p>

            <p>In the FX2N, Buffer memories 8 & 9 are utilized for setting the channel offset and gain. This feature is not available on the FX3U. Buffer Memory number, transfer source (value), and number of data points play a crucial role in configuring these settings. 
Initially, Buffer Memory #8 controls the offset/gain settings for Channel 1 and Channel 2 with an initial value of H0000. Buffer Memory #9, on the other hand, handles the offset/gain settings for Channel 3 and Channel 4 also with an initial value of H0000. 
Additionally, Buffer Memory #10 determines the offset data for Channel 1, with an initial offset value of 0 and a gain value of +5,000. The output mode for this setting is 0. The following Buffer Memories continue this pattern for the remaining channels. 
Buffer Memories #18 and #19 are reserved, while Buffer Memory #20 is designated for initialization with an initial value of 0. Lastly, Buffer Memory #21 adjusts the E I/O characteristics inhibition.</p>

            <p>In the FX3U, unit number, buffer memory number, transfer source value, and number of data points are not utilized. However, on the FX2N, buffer memories 8 and 9 correspond to channel offset and gain setting enable functions. This means that channel 2's offset and gain are being configured. The buffer memory description for buffer memory #8 includes the offset/gain setting command for channels 1 and 2, with an initial value of H0000. Buffer memory #9 includes the offset/gain setting command for channels 3 and 4, also with an initial value of H0000. Additionally, there are specific offset and gain data values for each channel, with various parameters like unit, initial offset value, initial gain value, and output mode. To adjust the characteristics of E/I/O, keep in mind the reserved words and the initialization process. If you have questions about specific values, such as why H1100 is set for CH2 or what value to use for CH3 like K9, refer to the manual for clarification.</p>

            <p>When it comes to configuring analog output signals, such as K9 and KH0011 for Channel 3 and KH1100 for Channel 4, it's important to keep in mind the default settings for 4-20mA, 0-20mA, and 0-10V modes. If you require adjustments to the output range, simply use the TO instruction to set the desired minimum and maximum values.

For example, if you are controlling a motor based on a percentage scale, you can easily convert the 0-100% range to 0-20mA. Similarly, if you only need the motor to operate from 10% to 100%, input a value range of 10-100. Then, within your scaling block, convert these values to the appropriate raw range (e.g. 0-1000 to 100-1000) to ensure accurate signal transmission.</p>

            <p>When utilizing the function SCL with parameters D0, D2, and D4, it may raise the question: why is MOV K2 to D2 necessary for scaling initialization? Is there a specific reason for choosing K2 over K10? Despite conducting tests, no distinction was observed between using K2 or K10, or any other numerical value for that matter.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Kawhi inquired about the usage of the function SCL with the command SCL D0 D2 D4 (note: D4 is a typo). Why is it necessary to initialize the scaling by MOV K2 D2 instead of K10? Despite conducting tests, there seems to be no discernible difference between using K2 or K10. The key input parameter (D2 in this example) denotes the starting point of a coordinate table, with D2 representing the number of XY coordinate pairs in the table beginning at the subsequent "device" D3. When MOV K2 D2 is called, the SCL instruction will process this as two pairs of coordinates for scaling: [X1, Y1] at D3 and D4; [X2, Y2] at D5 and D6. On the other hand, MOV K10 D2 signifies ten pairs of coordinates up to [X10, Y10] in D21 and D22. However, if D0 falls between X1 in D3 and X2 in D5 during execution, the SCL instruction will interpolate based on the first two XY pairs. The length of the table indicated by D2 is irrelevant in this scenario, be it 2, 10, or 100. It is crucial to note that if D2 serves as the input parameter for the SCL instruction, the output parameter should not be D4 as it corresponds to Y1 and would result in the overwrite of the output table.

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In a recent discussion, drbitboy shared valuable insights on an important aspect of coding. The input parameter (referred to as D2) signifies the starting point of a coordinate table. The value of the initial "device" (16-bit memory location, i.e., register), D2, represents the number of X,Y coordinate pairs present in the table that initiates at the subsequent "device," D3. For instance, if the instruction is MOV K2 D2, the SCL instruction will process two pairs of coordinates for scaling: [X1,Y1] at D3 and D4, and [X2,Y2] at D5 and D6.

On the contrary, if you use MOV K10 D2, the SCL instruction will interpret this as ten pairs of coordinates, up to [X10,Y10] in D21 and D22. Nevertheless, during actual execution, if the parameter value D0 falls between the X1 value in D3 and the X2 value in D5, the SCL instruction will utilize the first two [X,Y] pairs for interpolation, disregarding the length of the table indicated by parameter D2.

It is crucial to note that when the input parameter is D2, the output parameter should not be D4. This is because D4 represents the location of Y1 in the input table, and executing the instruction under this scenario would lead to overwriting the output table.

In summary, the selection of the number following the K in MOV K"D" D2 depends on the number of pairs of coordinates being processed. By understanding this concept, one can effectively optimize the code for efficient scaling and interpolation.</p>

However, it's easy to create your own function block by using the raw and scaled min/max values. While the SCL function can be used, it only requires two points (min/max).

            <p>If you are unfamiliar with piecewise linear interpolation, it is essential to conduct thorough research until you grasp the concept. It is crucial in programming to have the table known and loaded, including its size and length in a designated register before the first execution of the interpolation function. Changing the value of this register serves no purpose once the interpolation has been initiated.</p>

            <p>drbitboy explained that SCL is used for piecewise linear interpolation. If this concept is unfamiliar, it is advisable to conduct research until it is understood. It is recommended not to MOVE Kn D2 within the program without prior knowledge and loading of the table, including the size/length in D2, before the initial execution of SCL. Altering the value of D2 after this point serves no purpose. Are there any suggestions for practical application, such as specific projects to work on?

            <p>Kawhi inquired, "Do you have any suggestions for practice, such as specific projects to work on in my spare time?" It is important to read the manual thoroughly before starting any exercises. By following each instruction, analyzing the outcomes, and creating a framework of the instructions' functions, you can gradually develop a repertoire of simple instructions that can be combined to achieve more intricate controller behavior. Make sure to refer to the examples provided in the manual for each instruction as a starting point, and then experiment by adjusting the input parameters to observe how the output parameters are affected.</p>

            <p>The FX5 & Q series offer a wide range of instructions, with over 500 options available. While it may seem overwhelming to learn them all, it is important to at least try them out and understand how they work. By experimenting with projects such as tracking components on a conveyor or creating a pick & place robot, you can gain valuable hands-on experience. Simulating these processes using internal tags can help you test different scenarios and troubleshoot any issues. Additionally, creating custom functions for tasks like valve control can streamline your programming process and make it easier to manage multiple valves. By building a library of common functions, you can easily incorporate them into your code as needed. Overall, practice and experimentation are key to mastering PLC programming and taking on more complex projects in the future.</p>
