            <p>Hi John, it seems like you are facing challenges with a declining knowledge base and high levels of reactive maintenance. However, this could present an opportunity for positive change. Transforming the culture of an established maintenance team is often more difficult than with a new team. It sounds like you are considering making some changes – have you thought about how these changes will impact your plant's performance? It's important to measure the current state of your operations and connect it to plant performance metrics like cost per unit or raw output. Additionally, consider if upper management is supportive of these changes, as implementing new systems and training can be costly. Sorting through years of data to uncover hidden issues may be a challenge, especially without the expertise of your long-term team members. Seeking advice from industry experts could be helpful in navigating this process.</p>

            <p>The term "reactive maintenance" encompasses various definitions, all revolving around the concept of addressing unexpected system or equipment failures. While definitions may differ based on factors like planning levels and the definition of "failure", the core idea remains the same. To tackle this issue, I recommend two approaches. Firstly, increase the focus on proactive maintenance activities, such as condition monitoring and planned equipment shutdowns, to enhance plant condition understanding and minimize reactive maintenance. Secondly, identify and address the main causes of reactive maintenance by analyzing equipment failures and downtime data to prioritize problem areas. By addressing these key issues, you can create a foundation for more strategic maintenance planning. While my expertise lies in reliability and capacity modeling, I am passionate about maintenance practices and hope my insights can assist you in your journey. Please feel free to add your own experiences and knowledge in the comments. Regards, Damien.</p>

            <p>John, I am seeking your insights, firsthand experiences, and strategies for minimizing reactive maintenance in order to optimize maintenance costs and equipment reliability. Can you provide a clear definition of reactive maintenance and specify an acceptable percentage of time allotted for it each week? It is commonly understood that reactive maintenance is more expensive than proactive maintenance. What guidance would you offer to a client inquiring about this topic? Let's start with the basics: equipment can either be operational or non-operational. The latter can be due to maintenance, standby usage, or unexpected failures. Addressing unexpected failures is the essence of reactive maintenance, highlighting the importance of predicting and preventing such occurrences. To gain this predictive knowledge, we must first understand that approximately 10-20% of failures are age-related, caused by factors like wear, corrosion, fatigue, and fouling. Preventive maintenance based on equipment age can help address these issues. For non-age-related failures (80-90%), predictive maintenance, such as monitoring vibration, noise, and temperature, can help anticipate failures before they occur. There are also hidden failures, where the state of equipment is unknown, requiring timely testing based on Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) data. This comprehensive approach to maintenance may seem lengthy, but it is necessary for effective equipment management.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I have gained insights over time about equipment failures, specifically distinguishing between age-related and usage-related issues. Age-related failures involve constant wear mechanisms that become evident over time, such as the degradation of important additives in oil or equipment exposed to corrosive conditions. With the economic slowdown, it became clear that time-based preventive maintenance schedules were not effective for equipment reliant on usage as the primary wear factor. Transitioning to usage-based maintenance schedules and utilizing PI Historian for usage tracking allowed for more dynamic adjustments based on equipment usage. While there is no one-size-fits-all breakdown for work type percentages, it is essential to consider the design of systems such as RTF which may require a primarily reactive maintenance approach. Critical systems may benefit from a higher proportion of preventive maintenance, but the unpredictable nature of many failures necessitates a certain level of corrective maintenance. Utilizing outdated maintenance techniques can actually contribute to equipment failures, emphasizing the importance of adopting more efficient maintenance strategies like RCM. Ultimately, preserving the integrity of operating systems is often the most practical approach in ensuring equipment longevity.</p>

            <p>Thank you to everyone who has provided feedback so far. I am committed to continuously learning and enhancing my skills and knowledge. I am interested in exploring strategies to minimize reactive maintenance within the existing CMMS/EAM system, utilizing data reviews, analytical reports, and trending techniques to transition towards a more proactive approach. It is important to understand the various interpretations of "reactive maintenance." In my perspective, any repair work conducted outside of the regular schedule is considered reactive. Immediate repairs, as well as urgent ones, fall under this category. However, if a repair job is identified in advance, meticulously planned, and scheduled beforehand, I do not classify it as reactive maintenance. My belief is that pre-planned work enhances safety, efficiency, and coordination among the workforce. Conversely, reactive tasks often lead to chaos, errors, time wastage, and added costs. 

I am specifically focusing on CMMS client sites with limited engineering resources and little emphasis on planning or failure analysis, potentially leading to a predominantly reactive maintenance approach. How can we support these sites in transitioning towards a more proactive maintenance strategy? Additionally, regular data reviews are essential for identifying trends, issues, and patterns within the CMMS system. I am eager to engage in an ongoing discussion on these topics and welcome any additional insights and perspectives. Looking forward to hearing from you all.</p>

            <p>When assessing equipment failures, conducting a Pareto analysis of downtime by equipment number can reveal the root of your problems. Addressing these issues is crucial for creating room to enhance your planned activities. Moreover, resolving top failures can lead to quick victories that may impress your budget-holding managers. Focusing on the top 10 equipment failures or any relevant number can give you valuable insights to improve operations and gain leverage with decision-makers.</p>

            <p>The concept of preventive maintenance (PM) originated in the 1950s Manufacturing Industry, with a focus on preventing equipment failures before they disrupt production. As technology evolved, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) emerged, allowing for the prediction of component failure to facilitate proactive planning and scheduling of replacements. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) further influenced maintenance strategies, with some components being allowed to run-to-failure based on their impact. This approach requires proactive planning but reactive scheduling. Unforeseen breakdowns also occur, leading to purely reactive responses. Many companies struggle to differentiate between proactive and reactive maintenance, often treating all unscheduled activities as reactive. Despite the benefits of proactive maintenance, the term PM is often misleading as PdM and planned run-to-failure tasks are also proactive. Maintaining a low percentage of reactive work is seen as a key performance indicator, according to Ron Moore's "Making Common Sense..." book. Aim for limiting reactive work to 10% for optimal maintenance efficiency.</p>

            <p>We analyze top items from various perspectives, including downtime, maintenance hours, number of calls, and total maintenance costs. By using a level 2 system to track process downtimes, we identify the top items that cause disruptions. Similarly, by reviewing reactive work orders, we can pinpoint where maintenance hours are being spent and where the most frequent breakdowns occur. This allows us to focus on addressing these issues to minimize disruptions to our schedule. 

To protect our schedule, we have established a reaction team to handle all incoming calls, while the day maintenance teams focus on scheduled work. This ensures that resources are optimized and that scheduled work is prioritized. The strategy also considers how much scheduled work the reaction team can handle efficiently. 

Furthermore, data collected from inspections and random failures within the scheduling window is analyzed by specialized teams. Monthly corrective actions are implemented to prevent future issues, while larger initiatives and annual goals are determined through collaborative meetings and analysis. This iterative process drives continuous improvements within our operations.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What is considered an acceptable percentage of reactive maintenance per week?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While there is no universal benchmark, an acceptable percentage of reactive maintenance per week would typically depend on factors such as the size of the facility, the age of equipment, and the industry standards. Generally, a lower percentage of reactive maintenance is preferred to reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p>
