            <p>Bill Hedges, a corrosion expert at BP, noted that the Prudhoe Bay pipelines were built to last 25 years but have exceeded expectations by lasting 29 years, with many sections in excellent condition. It may be time to reevaluate the level of risk and estimate how much longer they can operate. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the water content post-removal process. Are operators or inspectors responsible for this monitoring?</p>

            <p>I believe that implementing advanced technology for detecting pipe corrosion is crucial in the oil industry. With BP's extensive resources, they should have no problem investing in the necessary tools and expertise for regular monitoring. The recent oil spill and shutdown reflect a severe lack of oversight and accountability from both BP and regulatory agencies. It is imperative to reconsider opening up more land for oil exploration, especially when entrusted to potentially negligent and inexperienced management. Walt.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why was the pipeline maintenance delayed due to corrosion build-up?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The maintenance was delayed due to the company's belief that ultrasonic testing of pipeline wall thickness was sufficient, which was later found to be inadequate.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Why wasn't routine maintenance 'pigging' initially considered necessary for the pipelines transporting refined crude oil without water content?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Officials did not see the need for routine maintenance 'pigging' initially because the pipelines transport refined crude oil without water content.</p>
