                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, Our business specializes in electricity generation with key assets in power plants and transmission systems. Our main focus is enhancing power plant reliability. We have been utilizing various tools in our maintenance program, such as RCM, RCA, and FMEA. We are now considering implementing the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) tool, which provides outputs similar to RCM. We are curious about the distinctions between RBI and RCM. It is worth noting that RBI originated in the Oil & Gas industry - how suitable would it be for use in power plants? 
Best regards.</p>

            <p>Adisorn Sri emphasizes the importance of using RBI for static equipment to prevent containment loss or structural damage. RBI is typically applied to equipment with a limited number of failure modes like corrosion or erosion. On the other hand, RCM is best suited for complex machinery such as pumps, compressors, and alternators that have multiple failure modes and potential consequences.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Reliability-based inspection (RBI) can be utilized in corrosion management for pipelines, static equipment such as steam drums and valves, and structural components like jacket legs. It is important to note that onshore structures, such as those found in power plants, are typically not exposed to the same level of corrosive environments as offshore structures.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What is the main difference between Risk Based Inspection (RBI) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM)?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - RBI focuses on assessing the risk associated with equipment failure and prioritizing inspection activities based on this risk, while RCM is a systematic approach to identifying the most effective maintenance strategies for critical assets.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How do RBI and RCM contribute to enhancing power plant reliability?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Both RBI and RCM help in improving power plant reliability by optimizing maintenance activities, reducing the likelihood of unexpected failures, and extending equipment lifespan.</p>
