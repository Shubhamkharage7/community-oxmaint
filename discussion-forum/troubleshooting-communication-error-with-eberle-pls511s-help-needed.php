                    <p>I recently bought a software, cable, and laptop in order to establish communication with an EBERLE PLS511 device. However, I am encountering a communication error despite setting up my port identical to the software configuration. I have tried multiple troubleshooting methods with no success. The cable provided seems to have internal chips, leading me to question its authenticity. If anyone can provide assistance or insight into what might be the issue, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>After some troubleshooting, we believe the issue may be with the cable's built-in dongle. Upon inspection, we discovered multiple stray wires causing a short circuit. A replacement cable has been ordered and we are hopeful that this will resolve the issue swiftly.</p>

            <p>After our first cable failed, we tried a second one which initially worked for about half a minute. Upon seeking advice, we discovered that Windows 98 may not be compatible with the software; most successful users were running Windows 95. We are currently in the process of loading Windows 95 onto our computer and will update you on its performance shortly.</p>

            <p>Cornbread mentioned that a second cable was obtained, but it only worked briefly for about 30 seconds. After seeking advice, it was suggested that Windows 98 should be able to run the software, but those who had success were using Windows 95. As a result, Windows 95 is being installed on the computer and the outcome will be shared. Hello, may I ask what connection cable is required for this setup? Thank you in advance. Smetana.</p>
