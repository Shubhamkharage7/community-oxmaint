                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello all, I am currently working on a project that involves data exchange between a Siemens S7-1200 PLC and an Allen-Bradley MicroLogix 1400 PLC. In this setup, the Siemens PLC functions as the master while the AB PLC operates as the slave. The data being exchanged includes integers and booleans, and it is crucial that the communication is both swift and dependable. I am exploring various methods to achieve this goal and considering the following options:

1. Utilizing an Ethernet/IP adapter module, like the CM 1243-5, for the Siemens PLC and configuring the AB PLC as an Ethernet/IP scanner. This setup would enable the use of the standard Ethernet/IP protocol for seamless data transmission between the PLCs. However, I am uncertain about the compatibility and performance of this approach.

2. Employing a Modbus TCP adapter module, such as the CM 1241, for the Siemens PLC and setting up the AB PLC as a Modbus TCP client. This method would leverage the widely accepted Modbus TCP protocol for exchanging data between the PLCs. Yet, I am unsure about the simplicity and adaptability of this solution.

3. Integrating a serial communication module, like the CM 1242-5, with the Siemens PLC and connecting it to the RS-232 port of the AB PLC. This configuration would allow for the use of a customized protocol for data transmission between the PLCs. Nonetheless, the speed and reliability of this setup remain uncertain.

Has anyone tested any of these approaches or can provide alternative suggestions? I would greatly appreciate insights and recommendations from fellow PLC experts. Thank you for taking the time to read through my query, and I look forward to your valuable input.</p>

            <p>Utilizing the onboard network port on an S7-1200 for Modbus TCP eliminates the need for an adapter. The CM-1241 module features a 9-pin serial port for RS232/422/485 connectivity. Different variants of the CM-1242 and CM-1243 modules cater to Profibus communication requirements. Leveraging the built-in network port is the optimal choice for Modbus TCP communication on an S7-1200 PLC.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I agree with @Puddle. Have any of you tried using Modbus TCP to connect MicroLogix and S7 PLCs? I have found it to be a reliable option that is easy to set up once both devices are configured correctly.

When it comes to communication speed, it's important to consider that Modbus is a polling protocol which can limit the speed. However, over TCP/IP, the data rate should be sufficient compared to a slower serial connection.

In this setup, the Siemens PLC acts as the master while the AB PLC acts as the slave. It may be worth considering configuring the AB PLC as a Modbus TCP client to ensure smooth communication between the devices.

Typically, the client is synonymous with the master and the server with the slave. However, it's important to designate the device that needs to know if communication fails as the master. If both devices need this information, setting up a heartbeat bit can allow both sides to monitor the connection effectively.</p>

            <p>The description below resembles the functionality of ChatGPT, but these three modules do not offer the specific functions mentioned despite having the relevant keywords. Siemens does not offer separate communication modules for EIP or Modbus TCP; instead, communication is achieved through instructions. Modbus TCP is integrated, while EIP requires a library download from the support site. Connectivity can be established using the built-in Ethernet port or an additional one. For serial communication, an RS232 card is needed, not a Profibus card.

One option is to use an Ethernet/IP adapter module like the CM 1243-5 for the Siemens PLC and configure the AB PLC as an Ethernet/IP scanner. This setup enables the use of the Ethernet/IP protocol for data exchange between the PLCs, though compatibility and performance may be a concern.

Another option is to utilize a Modbus TCP adapter module such as the CM 1241 for the Siemens PLC and set up the AB PLC as a Modbus TCP client. This enables data exchange using the widely adopted Modbus TCP protocol, but the ease and flexibility of this solution may need to be evaluated.

Alternatively, a serial communication module like the CM 1242-5 can be used for the Siemens PLC, connected to the RS-232 port of the AB PLC. This allows for custom protocol transmission between the PLCs, but the speed and reliability of this method should be considered.

Instead of an in-rack module, a gateway like Hilscher NetTAPs or Anybus is recommended. Siemens also offers a PN/MF coupler for this purpose. These devices facilitate real-time protocol translation between PLCs, making it simpler than dealing with software configurations within the PLC.</p>

            <p>Aside from the anybus and hilscher modules discussed earlier, I have also begun utilizing compact Exor panels as gateways for communication between Siemens PLCs on Profinet and Omron PLCs on Ethercat networks. These Exor panels provide seamless integration and data exchange between different industrial automation systems, offering a cost-effective solution for interconnectivity in automation environments.</p>

            <p>I have successfully implemented Modbus TCP communication between S7-1200 PLCs and ML-1400 controllers multiple times, finding it to be a simple and cost-effective solution. Both PLCs naturally support Modbus TCP, eliminating the need for any extra expenses. For those willing to invest, a RedLion Data Station could be a valuable addition.</p>

            <p>mk42 mentioned that the information provided resembles ChatGPT, but in reality, it pertains to a current issue. It is noted that the three modules lack the specified functions despite containing the necessary keywords. Siemens does not offer specific communication modules for EIP or Modbus TCP; instead, communication is achieved through instructions. Modbus TCP is already integrated, while EIP necessitates a library obtainable from the support website. The choice between utilizing the built-in Ethernet port or adding an additional one is available. Serial communication necessitates an RS232 card rather than a Profibus card. In lieu of an in-rack module, a gateway is typically utilized, with Hilscher netTAPs and Anybus being popular options. Siemens introduced a PN/MF coupler a few years ago, serving as a means to convert protocols between PLCs in real-time. This approach is more streamlined than attempting to resolve issues through software within the PLC. In conclusion, despite the similarity to ChatGPT, the issue at hand is real, and the advice provided is valued.</p>
