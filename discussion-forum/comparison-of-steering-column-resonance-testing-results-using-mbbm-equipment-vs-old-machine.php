                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>We recently purchased new equipment from MBBM to test the natural frequency of a steering column and compared the results with an older test machine. The tests were conducted three times on the same steering column, yielding different outcomes each time. 
During the first test, both MBBM and the old machine excited a frequency of 60Hz before the MBBM sensor fell from a 1-meter height. In the second test, MBBM excited a frequency of 44Hz while the old machine remained at 60Hz. 
In the third test, MBBM excited frequencies of 50Hz and 60Hz simultaneously, while the old machine stuck to 60Hz, indicating a potential issue with the sensor. 
Additionally, the impact VB value from hammer hits started in the negative range instead of zero. This discrepancy may be due to excessive adhesive used to attach the sensor. We have ruled out human error and cable issues. Your assistance in resolving these matters is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I am not well-versed in the MBBM, but based on my experience with similar equipment, I would suggest checking the stability of the bias voltage. Fluctuations in bias can lead to varying results. It appears that the response of the MBBM's accelerometer may have been altered when it was dropped. It is important to recalibrate it and adjust the bias voltage accordingly. Perhaps seeking assistance from someone knowledgeable about MBBMs would be beneficial in resolving these issues.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are the differences observed in the steering column resonance testing results using MBBM equipment versus the old machine?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The tests conducted using MBBM equipment and the old machine yielded varying outcomes. In one test, both machines excited a frequency of 60Hz before the MBBM sensor fell from a height. In another test, MBBM excited a frequency of 44Hz while the old machine remained at 60Hz. During a third test, MBBM excited frequencies of 50Hz and 60Hz simultaneously, while the old machine remained at 60Hz, indicating a potential issue with the sensor.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What potential issues were identified during the testing process?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - An issue was identified with the sensor, as the old machine consistently stuck to 60Hz while the MBBM equipment showed varying frequencies. Additionally, the impact VB value from hammer hits started in the negative range instead of zero, potentially due to excessive adhesive used to attach the sensor. Human error and cable issues were ruled out as causes of discrepancies.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How can discrepancies in test results using MBBM equipment and the old machine be resolved?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To resolve discrepancies, it is important to investigate and address the potential issue with the sensor identified during the testing process. Additionally, ensuring the correct attachment of the sensor without excessive adhesive may help in obtaining accurate results. Conducting further tests and calibrations as needed can aid in resolving these matters.</p>
