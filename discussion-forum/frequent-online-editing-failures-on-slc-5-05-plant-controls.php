                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am experiencing a frustrating issue with my online edits when using the slicks in my plant. The problem occurs randomly, but quite frequently - around 50% of the time. It usually occurs during accept edits, test edits, or assemble edits, making editing programs a tedious task. Despite using a wireless connection, I only lose connection once every few hours, while the online edits failing happens every few minutes. This leads me to believe that the issue is not related to my wireless connection. Can anyone offer insight into why this might be happening?</p>

            <p>A few months ago, I experienced a similar situation which I managed to overcome. It was definitely frustrating! Now, I have a question regarding changing the CIP options for SLC or Micro controllers, and whether it is necessary or recommended to revert them back for Control or Compact Logix systems.</p>

            <p>User stretch_af shared their experience of encountering a certain issue several months ago, but managed to overcome it successfully. They asked if changing CIP options for the SLC or Micro controllers necessitates changing them back for a Control or Compact Logix. According to their response, there should be no need to revert the settings as everything else functions properly. They prefer to set up new laptops in this manner and have never faced any issues, questioning why it is not the default setting.</p>

            <p>It appears that old attachments may have been lost during a past forum software upgrade. The solution mentioned here can be found in this thread, as explained by Ken Roach. There is a common issue with RSLinx Classic when using the SLC-5/05 and MicroLogix 1100 related to CIP buffer allocation. Symptoms may include failed edits and being kicked offline. The good news is that the solution involves adjusting certain settings in the RSLinx Classic Options menu. Referencing RA Knowledgebase32963, go to Communications -> Configure CIP Options Menu and change the Max. "Fast" Messaging Connections per PLC and Max. "Slow" Messaging Connections per PLC to 1.</p>
