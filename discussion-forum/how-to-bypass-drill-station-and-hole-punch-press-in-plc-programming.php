            <p>In order to effectively bypass stations in a production line, it is important to conduct thorough research on the sequence of operations. Understanding how the line functions will allow you to pinpoint the PLC outputs that govern the station functions. Locate the specific rungs in the PLC program that correspond to these outputs and implement logic to prevent their activation when bypassing stations. Having the program structured as a step-by-step sequence will simplify your task, as it includes logic for controlling which PLC outputs are active at each step and for transitioning between steps. This approach will streamline the process and ensure smooth operation of the production line.</p>
