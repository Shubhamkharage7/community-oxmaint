                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p><noscript>Posted on December 05, 2017 at 08:06 AM</noscript> Hello everyone, we are facing an issue with our furnace that has seven overhung fans attached to the side wall. In an effort to reduce beat frequency, we have set every other fan to operate at different speeds - 1080 and 980 RPM. The problem arises when the fans change direction from clockwise to counterclockwise during operation. This switch in direction results in a significant increase in vibration levels, reaching up to 1.04 ips in the axial direction and 0.8 ips in one of the radial directions. Additionally, there are impacts observed in both axial and radial directions, with a Crest Factor of up to 7.4 Gs.

The fan vendor suggests that the issue is structural, possibly due to a resonance problem, based on past experiences. However, no additional testing has been conducted to support this claim. Unfortunately, we are unable to perform further testing until January when the furnace will be taken down. I am puzzled by the vendor's explanation of a resonance problem as the high 1X vibration and Crest Factor trends suggest otherwise.

Details about the bearings being Link Belt P363 and belt driven are also worth mentioning. My queries are as follows:

- Can resonance cause an impact at 1X running speed in the axial direction?
- Why does the vibration spike significantly when only three or four fans change rotational direction?
- Is this issue primarily structural or related to balance/mechanical factors?

Thank you for your insights and assistance. Have a great day, Charlie</p>

            <p>One common question is: What specific role do fans play in changing direction during a cycle? Do they blow air into the boiler (furnace) and then draw air out at the end of the cycle? Are they induced draft fans, forced draft fans, or both depending on the cycle? Do they simply keep air circulating around the boiler (furnace) without actually feeding air to fire it up? And do all 7 fans change direction simultaneously? Thank you and have a wonderful day, Ralph.</p>

            <p>Hello Charlie, I was wondering about the amplitude of the "three or four fans are affected" before they increase with a change in direction. I'm also curious if there is a phase shift when the amplitude increases. Thank you and have a wonderful day! Merry Christmas, Ralph.</p>

            <p>When examining airflow systems, it's important to consider flow-induced resonance. As air moves further away from the fan, the duct work typically decreases in size. Reversing the air flow can have a significant impact on suction and discharge pressure, potentially causing the fan to struggle for air or leading to duct work issues such as flexing or collapsing. Vane axial fans, with blades attached to a central hub and pitched at specific angles, may experience deflection if run in reverse due to differences in blade thickness. Strobe light inspections of fan blades for rubbing marks and checking for impacts within mounted tube fans can provide valuable insights. Consider dedicating two fans for each direction or reversing the blade direction for improved performance. For more personalized advice, please provide additional details about your fans. Hope this information proves helpful. Thank you, Dave.</p>

            <p>Dave raised some pertinent questions regarding the fan system. He emphasized the importance of providing more details about the fans, particularly regarding phase change and the consistency of higher amplitudes. It is crucial to confirm if the blades are designed as mentioned by Dave. Have the "3 or 4" fans undergone a physical inspection? Can direct access be obtained to the bearings with a transducer? It would be beneficial to share a "real-time" picture for better assessment. Thank you and Happy Holidays, Ralph.</p>

            <p>The issue at hand likely stems from the use of vane axial fans, which generate thrust in the opposite direction of airflow. This means that when the fan reverses, the axial force also reverses. It's possible that the locating bearing permits some axial movement to accommodate thermal expansion. If there is axial clearance in the bearing, the shaft may experience slight axial motion, leading to components rubbing and causing increased vibration and high crest factor in the acceleration waveform. To identify the problem areas, it's advisable to conduct further investigation by analyzing acceleration readings at various locations. Utilizing specialized bearing fault detection parameters like PeakVue, SpikeEnergy, and Shock Pulse can be particularly helpful in pinpointing the source of impacting amplitude. Additionally, mounting a dial indicator at the end of the fan shaft to test for axial motion during reverse rotation can provide valuable insights. By placing a bearing ball in the shaft center bore and using wax to secure it, a precise indication of any axial movement can be obtained.</p>

            <p>When analyzing the data, it was found that all fans exhibit consistent hot air temperature in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. In clockwise rotations, 7 motor-belt-fan setups show normal vibration levels. However, in counterclockwise rotations, there is abnormal vibration in all 7 setups (or potentially only 4 out of the 7). 
The recent installation of Vee Belts with a high quality and temperature rating suggests that the rubber and ply quality of the belts may be expanding with the temperature of the hot air, leading to varying contact forces in different directions. It is important to consider the longevity of the vee belts in such conditions. 
If the issue is only present in 4 setups, it is recommended to reinforce the fan mount members to address the abnormal vibrations. For further inquiries, please contact Peter Macalua from Port Arthur, Texas at pbmacalua@yahoo.com.</p>

            <p>Given the abundance of helpful suggestions, it is recommended to perform the following checks: 1. Investigate belt strand resonance 2. Look into rotating stall. It is possible that all fans except this one are in stall, resulting in high axial vibration. Alternatively, it could be the other way around.</p>
