                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of having separate area and facilities maintenance teams? In this scenario, there are around 350 skilled tradespeople working in various crafts such as electrical, mechanical, millwright, and plumbing within an automotive components manufacturing and assembly plant that has a diverse equipment base. Area maintenance focuses on maintaining equipment and processes used in manufacturing or assembly, while facilities maintenance is responsible for infrastructure such as boiler rooms, coolant systems, HVAC, buildings, and grounds. Area maintenance teams report directly to Operations, while the facilities group reports to plant engineering. Your insights and opinions on this setup are appreciated. Thank you, Bob.</p>

            <p>Our approach to utilities equipment involves a combination of in-house maintenance team and utility operators. Our Facilities Group focuses on building and grounds maintenance tasks such as drywall, painting, snow removal, and landscaping. While the department is overseen internally, the actual work is outsourced for efficiency. This management strategy has proven to be effective for ensuring optimal facility upkeep.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my view, it would be beneficial to create two separate Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) groups that operate out of the same office under one leader. One group will focus on equipment maintenance while the other will handle facility maintenance. This approach can significantly improve the overall efficiency and return on investment (ROI) of a large company by ensuring more employees are trained in reliability practices. With a unified leadership, the boss can effectively coordinate efforts to enhance equipment and facility reliability, leading to a more streamlined operation.</p>

            <p>In our organization, we emphasize the importance of collaboration. Reporting to the Engineering Director, our Maintenance Manager oversees a team of Maintenance Supervisors responsible for area maintenance, including utilities equipment. Additionally, we have a Facility Supervisor who manages buildings and grounds maintenance, including tasks such as landscaping, housekeeping, and pest control. While facilities work is typically outsourced, equipment maintenance is predominantly carried out in-house.</p>

            <p>It appears that your plant is similar in size to ours. Our maintenance department is known as process maintenance, and our maintenance program involves collaboration between area maintenance, operations, and plant engineering. I believe it is essential for plant engineering to have oversight of area maintenance, as operational managers often have a narrow focus on maintenance tasks. Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Predictive Maintenance (PdM) are often overlooked in favor of keeping the assembly line running smoothly. Recently, we made the decision to have plant engineering take the lead on maintenance once again. As a result, we have implemented new Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) programs, upgraded our Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs), prioritized overdue PM tasks, and invested in new PdM technology. It is clear that maintenance should be under the control of plant engineering, rather than operations.</p>
