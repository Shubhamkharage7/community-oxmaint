            <p>The launch of our new website is receiving great feedback! Kudos to everyone involved in making this happen.

            <p>Hello Tricia, I am currently trying to participate in a discussion thread from the previous website in the vibration/alignment/balancing community. However, I am encountering an issue where it appears as Read Only and my membership is Limited. Despite searching through the Communities, I am unable to find an option to Join that would allow me to switch from Read Only to Read/Write. How can I address this issue? Thank you, Neil
