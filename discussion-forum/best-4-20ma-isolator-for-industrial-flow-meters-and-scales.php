            <p>Ken Moore mentioned using isolators from Moore Industries, known for their durability and SIL rating. I also utilized Moore Industries isolators to convert 0-1mA signals to 4-20mA for a PLC, allowing me to easily interface with an induction heater. These isolators have been operational without any issues since 2016. Find out more about these reliable isolators at Moore Industries' website.</p>

            <p>Dale87 inquired about the best 4-20mA isolator for multiple flow meters and scales with 4-wire connections. Isolating the signals before reaching the non-isolated Analog input card, such as the 5069 IF8, is crucial for optimal performance. While isolation may not be mandatory if all instruments are already isolated, it is still recommended for smoother operation and protection against potential interference.</p>

            <p>In a recent project, I utilized signal isolators from Moore Industries to extract 4 signals from an induction heater that were originally designed for panel meters. These isolators effectively scaled the signals from 0-1mA to 4-20mA for seamless integration with the PLC. Since their installation in 2016, they have been running flawlessly. It is worth mentioning that the packaging of these Moore Industries devices has remained unchanged for over three decades, a testament to their reliable design.

Similarly, Action Paks, another popular choice for signal conditioning, have also retained their classic packaging. Just like in the past, users still have to select specific inputs and outputs for desired signal conversion. This customizable approach was appreciated back then and continues to be a unique feature of these devices.

            <p>JERA advised to check out Phoenix Contact's signal conditioners and measuring transducers at their website. I have reservations about the reliability of Phoenix contacts based on a customer's experience with their electroplating line. Despite purchasing both new and used Phoenix contacts, they had to constantly replace them due to frequent failures. However, after switching to PR units, the failures ceased completely. This raises concerns about the durability of the Phoenix contacts compared to other brands in industrial settings.</p>
