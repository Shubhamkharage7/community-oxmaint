                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>We currently have a slow and sluggish L71 with watchdog faults and are considering upgrading to an L8 series model. Due to a limited budget, we are exploring options on eBay for an L8x series, specifically aiming for an L84 or L85 model known for their faster performance. I have noticed variations like the L85E - what sets this apart from the standard L85 model? Additionally, some versions have the designation L85EK, which I believe indicates conformal coating. Shouldn't conformal coating be a standard feature for all models, eliminating the need for separate part numbers?</p>

            <p>I would exercise caution when purchasing Rockwell parts on eBay as there have been instances of counterfeit products being sold. One example includes a powerflex drive that turned out to be fake, causing a lengthy resolution process. Rockwell's practices have been criticized for their frequency of epoxy-coating circuit boards, making DIY repairs difficult. However, this method may not be enough to prevent potential issues like short circuits, especially when external components like mechanical buzzers are installed near a PLC.</p>

            <p>When it comes to purchasing control system hardware, it is highly advisable to avoid buying from unauthorized sources like eBay. Be cautious of listings for the 1756-L8x controller, as the correct model is actually the 1756-L8xE, with the 'x' denoting the controller's memory size and not its performance capabilities. It is crucial to only procure hardware from approved vendors authorized by the manufacturer to ensure authenticity and reliability.

While opting for cheaper alternatives on eBay may seem tempting, the risk of receiving counterfeit or defective products is high. The cost of using such unreliable hardware can far exceed the initial savings, especially if it leads to system malfunctions or downtime. It is recommended to only purchase from trusted vendors to avoid such risks.

In certain cases, such as personal use at home or testing purposes, buying control system hardware on eBay may be acceptable. However, vigilance is essential, particularly due to the proliferation of counterfeit products from China in the market. Prioritize purchasing from approved vendors to safeguard the efficiency and reliability of your control systems.</p>

            <p>If all other sources fail and our production line is down, eBay becomes our final option. When the lead time from the approved vendor is too lengthy, we turn to suppliers like Radwell or EU Automation.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. FAQ: What are the benefits of upgrading from a ControlLogix L71 to an L8 series model like the L84 or L85?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Upgrading to an L8 series model such as the L84 or L85 offers faster performance compared to the older L71 model, potentially resolving issues like watchdog faults and improving overall system efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. FAQ: What is the difference between the standard L85 model and the L85E variation?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The L85E variation of the ControlLogix L85 model may offer specific enhancements or additional features tailored for certain applications. It's advisable to check with the manufacturer or seller for detailed specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. FAQ: What does the 'EK' designation in models like L85EK signify, and why does it indicate conformal coating?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The 'EK' designation typically indicates that the model has conformal coating, which provides protection against environmental factors such as moisture, dust, and chemicals. While conformal coating may be a standard feature for some models, it is often specified in the part number to ensure clarity and compatibility for buyers.</p>
