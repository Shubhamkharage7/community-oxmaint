                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>It has been some time since I last worked with Fanuc robots, but now I am faced with the task of backing up the system. While I successfully performed the "All of Above" backup using a USB stick, I encountered an issue with the image backup process. The robot model is a Fanuc R-30iA V7.4 (manufactured in 2008), and I am using a 4GB USB thumb drive formatted with FAT32. Despite the successful AoA backup, the image backup seems to get stuck on the Boot Loader Screen during "Initializing USB". I am considering using a Memory Card as an alternative solution. Additionally, I have come across the option of performing an image backup through Ethernet and would appreciate any guidance on this method. Any assistance in solving this issue would be greatly appreciated. In case anyone finds themselves in a similar predicament, I discovered a workaround by turning off the power, removing the USB stick, then restarting the device while holding F1 and F5 to access the BMON menu. By navigating to the Configuration menu and selecting Hot Start, I was able to confirm that all programs remained intact.</p>

            <p>The appearance of the message "Initializing USB" while performing an image backup raises concerns. Consider using a smaller USB stick to resolve the issue. It is important to note that the AOA backup does not include ASCII files. To ensure these files are backed up, proceed to the next step and select "BACKUP 2" to obtain the ASCII programs. This way, you will have the LS files of your TP programs securely stored.</p>

            <p>In a last-ditch effort, I attempted to format the 4GB USB stick to FAT16 just like throwing a "hail mary" pass. Surprisingly, I was successful in performing the AOA backup, but encountered issues with the image backup (yielding the same outcome). It has been quite some time since I last executed these tasks. Could I be overlooking a crucial step? Is it necessary to be in Cold Start or Controlled Start mode? Perhaps I need to adjust a setting to proceed?</p>

            <p>In the past, I have encountered issues with USB sticks of certain sizes on R30iA controllers. To avoid compatibility problems, I always keep both a 512MB and a 2GB stick on hand. I have also utilized smaller CompactFlash cards with a PCMCIA adapter, as they are more readily available and cost-effective than PCMCIA cards of varying sizes. You may want to try formatting the USB stick to a smaller size, such as 2GB, to see if it resolves the issue. For a step-by-step guide on how to do this, visit this link. I hope this information proves helpful in resolving any compatibility issues.</p>

            <p>To enhance your data storage options, consider using the compact USB drive. Access the controlled start menu to explore the possibility of conducting an image backup. Keep in mind that the image backup feature in the backup menu is a relatively new addition.</p>

            <p>I experimented with "resizing" the USB drive as you advised. I successfully reduced it to 512MB and reformatted it to FAT. Unfortunately, I encountered the same issue despite these changes. I discovered in the controller manual a warning against using a USB drive for image backups at BMON. However, the manual also provides instructions on how to perform an image backup using a USB drive. At this stage, it seems like there may be a problem with the robot controller, leaving the only feasible solution to use a PCMCIA card.</p>
