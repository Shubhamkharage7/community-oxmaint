            <p>Utilizing skids can help decrease system rigidity, but it also increases the risk of resonance issues caused by the natural frequency matching the harmonic frequency of speed. To prevent this, opting for stiffer skids is advised to elevate the natural frequency into a higher frequency range. This adjustment will help mitigate resonance problems and improve overall system performance.</p>

            <p>A few years back, we focused on boosting our oil refinery's production capacity by installing new pumps with un-grouted base frames. It appears that only the skid's feet are secured to the plinth, leaving the rest of the base frame empty. Despite minimal issues with vibrations, the lightweight construction of some pumps caused alignment challenges. The pedestals tend to flex significantly as the pump heats up and the pipework expands, even with proper layout and support measures in place. Investing in high-quality skids is crucial to avoid long-term costs and issues, especially when using API pumps.</p>

            <p>I always opt for machined cast iron skids with thorough grouting post pipe and drive alignment. A savvy Maintenance Manager knows the value of investing an extra 5-10% in well-designed, carefully selected, and expertly installed equipment. After all, it's not likely to be his budget he's regretting.</p>

            <p>A few years back, a chemical plant I worked at decided to purchase skids equipped with all thread for support. The intention was to easily hang them onto the piping, secure the all thread down until the bottom pads made contact with the floor, and voila, job done. Despite our skepticism in the Project Management department, the plant persisted in using them, even amidst leaks at the pump flange. These skids were marketed as a quick and easy solution, perfect for those seeking simplicity in their operations.</p>
