                    <p>Hello everyone! I need assistance and suggestions with troubleshooting an S7-300 PLC programmed with TIA Portal V15 online monitoring. Despite comparing the software and finding no differences, I am unable to access the monitoring function as the icon is greyed out. The software copy is obtained from the OEM, and even uploading a copy from the PLC results in the same issue. The file name ends with @@@@@920.zap15, indicating compatibility with V15. I have tried installing all update packs, but the problem persists. Any suggestions or insights on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Is there a possibility that the code was generated and transferred using Step7 5.x before being uploaded to TIA Portal? I tried replicating your scenario and encountered the same issue. Perhaps you could try uploading or testing it with Step7 V5.6 or 5.7.</p>

            <p>It is possible that the CPU you received was downloaded from a different version of Portal, and the OEM provided you with an updated version. Portal is known for being particular about project version compatibility, although it tends to be more lenient with firmware updates.</p>

            <p>In response to bb76's comment, it was mentioned that .zap files are archives that need to be extracted in order to access the program. Are you currently monitoring the program through online access only? 

Hello bb76, I have extracted the program from Portal V15 and noticed discrepancies in the original copy. Uploading the program from the device resulted in a change in its structure (refer to the attached photos - media(1) shows the original OEM copy, while media shows the updated version). I am uncertain if this is affecting my ability to monitor the program online. I am attempting to go online and then monitor through the FC.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, thank you for your assistance. I encountered two issues during my programming process. Firstly, I discovered a Danfoss Drive that wasn't properly linked to the network. After resolving this issue, I still encountered difficulties getting online with the FC's. A full software upload resolved this, with all indicators turning green in the photos. However, after comparing, certain blocks showed discrepancies in orange or blue. Interestingly, there were no software differences found, only timestamp variations. I re-downloaded the blocks and was finally able to go online and monitor. While monitoring, I noticed a block I was observing suddenly showing differences. Despite finding nothing wrong in the comparison, I re-downloaded the block to rectify the issue. It appears that S7-300's with Portal can be quite sensitive to such changes.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is the monitoring icon for my S7-300 PLC greyed out in TIA Portal V15 despite no differences in the software?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The greyed out monitoring icon issue could be due to compatibility issues or configuration settings within TIA Portal V15. It is recommended to check for any software updates, compatibility of the PLC firmware with TIA Portal V15, and ensure proper configuration settings for online monitoring.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What should I do if uploading a copy from the PLC also results in the monitoring icon being greyed out?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - If uploading a copy from the PLC does not resolve the greyed out monitoring icon issue, it is advisable to verify the compatibility of the uploaded program with TIA Portal V15, ensure proper communication settings between the PLC and the programming software, and check for any potential software or hardware conflicts.</p>
