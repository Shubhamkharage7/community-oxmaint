            <p>Hello Jacob. While we haven't attended any trade shows yet, we have conducted thorough research to identify wireless equipment that is compatible with our current software, hardware, and requirements. Below is a curated list of companies we have explored so far that might be beneficial for you. The options available in the market are plentiful. If you require any documentation from the mentioned companies, feel free to message me and I will promptly share the relevant files. Patty Warner. 

Are you seeking advice on the optimal trade shows or conferences to discover or showcase wireless vibration sensors and software? While IMC and SMRP are popular options, are there any other industry-specific events with an active participant community that you should consider? Your insights are valuable. Thank you. Jacob Loverich.</p>

            <p>Hello Jacob,

I wanted to suggest another option for monitoring called Nikola Lab. They offer a test where they will install up to 200 sensors for $199. You can then decide whether to purchase the system if you find it suitable for your needs.

Best regards,
Gary Latham

Hi Jacob,

We haven't attended any maintenance and reliability trade shows, but we have conducted research to find wireless equipment compatible with our current software/hardware. Here is a list of companies we have looked into that may be helpful for you. If you need any documentation from these companies, feel free to message me and I will provide what we have on file.

Looking for suggestions on top maintenance and reliability trade shows or conferences where wireless vibration sensors and software are featured. IMC and SMRP are well-known, but are there any industry-specific events with a strong participant community that you would recommend?
Thank you!

            <p>Hello Jacob,

I may be biased, but you may want to consider checking out the AMS Wireless Vibration Monitors from Emerson. These monitors are designed to provide reliable and efficient vibration monitoring solutions. You can find more information about them at https://www.emerson.com/documents/automation/product-data-sheet-ams-wireless-vibration-monitor-ams-en-7030352.pdf. 

If you're looking for trade shows or conferences to explore wireless vibration sensors and software, some popular ones to consider are IMC and SMRP. Additionally, there may be industry-specific events that cater to participants in this field. These events can provide a great platform for networking and discovering new technologies in vibration monitoring.
