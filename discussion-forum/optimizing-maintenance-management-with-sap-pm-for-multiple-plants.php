            <p>We implemented SAP R/3 4.6 for multiple plants, managing warehouses, cost centers, work centers, and functional locations specific to each plant. Currently, we operate SAP for two plants after selling one. Our system includes Finance, Production Planning, Procurement, Human Resources, and more, not limited to just the PM module. Functional locations are structured in four levels, with the first level being the plant, the second level representing buildings or external plant areas, and the last two levels detailing subdivisions within these locations.</p>

            <p>According to Josh, setting up SAP for multiple sites is essential. Do you have a background in IT? While I have a strong IT background, resolving issues with two sites on a single system can be challenging due to the core policy being centered around the accounting module rather than the maintenance module.</p>

            <p>In the past, Eugene implemented SAP R/3 4.6 for three plants, with the system still in operation for two plants after one was sold. Each plant was set up with defined warehouses, cost centers, main work centers, and functional locations. The implementation included modules such as Finance, Production Planning, Procurement, and Human Resources, in addition to PM. Functional locations were structured with four levels, starting with the plant at the first level and further details at the subsequent levels. Despite having separate equipment numbers, two sites shared a single team for management tasks.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Our equipment numbering system is customized for each plant to prevent duplicate numbers across locations within our shared database. For instance, Plant A uses 3-digit numbers without dashes, while Plant B uses 2-digit location codes followed by a dash. Each physical plant in our system has a dedicated Maintenance Plant and Planning Plant in SAP. This structure aligns with our staffing allocation, such as one planner for Plant A and multiple planners for Plant C. We opted against creating separate planning plants for Plants A and C, as it is more practical to mirror real-life operations in SAP. If maintenance planning is shared between two plants, it is recommended to set up two Maintenance Plants and one shared Planning Plant.</p>

            <p>Are you searching for information on the levels of company codes in SAP? At level 1, the company code is 0001. Moving on to level 2, each Physical Plant in SAP is represented by Plant 1 = PL01 and Plant 2 = PL02. Additionally, at level 3, each plant in SAP has a corresponding Maintenance Plant where functional locations and equipment are attached. The codes used for Maintenance Plants are the same as those used for Plants, such as Maint Plant 1 = PL01 and Maint Plant 2 = PL02. When it comes to level 4, the decision needs to be made on whether to have one Planning Plant for both Maintenance Plants or separate Planning Plants for each. If the planning is done by the same team for both plants, setting just one Planning Plant is recommended. Codes for Planning Plants are consistent with those used for Physical Plants, such as Planning Plant 1 = PL01. At level 5, Planner Groups are defined by the Planning Plant. For a single Planning Plant, Planner Group 001 can be set for the first plant and Planner Group 002 for the second plant. Planner Groups 010, 020, and 030 are commonly used and assigned to each Planning Plant. Additionally, a warehouse for Spare Parts is established at each plant.</p>

I agree with Josh's advice, but my boss now wants to know if it's feasible to implement a single system for multiple plant sites. If one team is responsible for maintaining several plants, I am beginning to transition to a paperless system for SAP-PM. How can I gradually implement this paperless approach? I have come across discussions about using mobile devices to support my idea.</p>

            <p>Are you uncertain about the necessity of using portable devices in a paperless system? Technicians must be familiar with the procedures for carrying out maintenance orders for equipment situated on the roof of a building. There are two options available: a paper-based system and a paperless system. In the paper-based system, the maintenance order is printed on paper for the technician to take to the roof for execution and documentation. On the other hand, in a paperless system, technicians can choose between Method A, which involves memorizing the order, and Method B, which utilizes a portable device. With Method B, the order is downloaded to a portable computer device, enabling the technician to record the execution of the order, add comments, and sign electronically. The device can then be connected to the computer network to update the order in real time.</p>

            <p>One way to streamline the maintenance process is by utilizing a portable device. This involves downloading the work order onto a handheld computer, which the technician can then carry around the plant to complete the tasks. They can easily record their progress, add comments, and even electronically sign off on the work directly on the device. While there are intrinsically safe PDAs available for such purposes, it may not be practical for technicians to use them in high-risk areas like V-type roofs. The risk of accidents increases when trying to juggle a PDA along with safety gear and tools. In this scenario, the PDA may not be the most reliable tool to rely on.</p>

            <p>In response to AromaticsThailand's inquiry, Eugene was asked to provide an organization map that depicts objects from the top level down to the equipment level. Regarding the topic at hand, AromaticsThailand, has the question been adequately addressed? When it comes to planning for multiple plants, it is advisable to have one Planning Plant and one Planning Group if the same planners will be overseeing both facilities.

Functional Locations are intricately linked to the Maintenance Plants, with four (4) levels in the FL structure, where the Plant serves as the first level. Equipment is connected to Functional Locations at their respective levels, with minor equipment units potentially connected to main equipment. For instance, pumps are linked to tanks they serve, while pressure indicators are attached to the pumps they monitor.</p>

            <p>When dealing with non-explosion proof equipment, it is important to obtain the necessary work permits before bringing it into a designated explosion-proof zone. It is vital to note that not all areas are equipped to withstand explosions, so referencing your electrical drawings is imperative.</p>

            <p>When selecting a portable device, it is important to consider various factors. Ensure the device is compatible with the CMMS/applications being used, as well as rugged enough to withstand the industrial environment, including accidental drops and liquid splashes. It is also worth investigating if any devices are explosion proof/intrinsically safe. Additionally, conducting a risk analysis and implementing risk management through work permits, as recommended by Josh, is essential. Explore the different options available to find a device that meets these requirements.</p>

            <p>In my maintenance management scenario, the operation supervisor uses the SAP-PM terminal on their PC to report problems encountered during field operations. The planner then monitors and verifies the problem using SAP-PM, creating a job scope for corrective action. The maintenance team carries out the job upon receiving a hard copy work order (MO), with non-SAP tasks such as opening permits and preparing tools. 

Once the job is completed, the maintenance supervisor confirms the job completion time on the SAP-PM terminal in their office and sends the hard copy MO to the planner for failure data entry. The planner then enters all feedback data in SAP-PM in their office, closes the job, and files away the hard copy. 

All three parties involved in the process - operation, planner, and maintainer - use their terminal PCs in their office at the plant. Given this scenario, the question arises whether portable devices should also be used in the process.</p>

            <p>What happens to an order in the transition between the Maintenance Supervisor receiving it at their PC and returning it to their office for time confirmation? In a paper-based system, the Maintenance Supervisor or Technician prints the order on paper, collects necessary parts and tools from the stockroom, and completes the work while documenting findings on the order. Signatures are obtained as per procedures, and the order is returned to the Maintenance Supervisor for approval and time confirmation before being archived. If the technician needs equipment manuals at the job site, they may need to make copies as manuals may not be allowed off-site. 

In a paperless system, the technician receives the order electronically on a portable PC device, completes the work, and updates SAP with the order information at a terminal equipped with an upload/download device or through wireless synchronization. The Maintenance Supervisor then confirms the time. Benefits of a paperless system include reduced need for physical storage, lower risk of lost information, faster information retrieval, and additional information accessible to technicians on their portable devices, such as all open orders for the equipment they are working on and downloadable equipment manuals and drawings.

Overall, transitioning to a paperless system streamlines the maintenance process and provides technicians with quicker access to information to facilitate efficient work completion.</p>

            <p>In addition to Technician tasks, portable devices can also be utilized for Planning purposes. Do Planners work solely from their office, or do they visit job sites to assess work requirements? If visiting job sites is necessary, Planners can save time by using portable devices to input and release maintenance orders directly to the Maintenance Supervisor, eliminating the need to transfer manual notes to their office computers.</p>
