                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>My site has been housing my GE frame 9 gas turbines since April 2007, awaiting installation. Around three months after receiving them, we utilized dehumidifiers for preservation. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) has recommended a boroscope inspection and opening up the turbine before commissioning in late 2010. While I am in favor of the boroscope inspection, I have reservations about the cost and length of time required for the opening up process before commissioning. Can you offer any advice on how to proceed?</p>

            <p>What were the reasons behind the three-year delay in installation, from 2007 to 2010? Understanding the importance of opening up before installation can shed light on why it is a crucial step in the process.</p>

            <p>Before commissioning, it may only be necessary to conduct a boroscopic inspection and examine the bearings if the turbines are well maintained. Asking the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) about the necessary inspections for overhauling the turbine is recommended. If boroscopy can suffice, then an overhaul may not be needed.</p>

            <p>As previously mentioned by Mohammad, GE has not specified exactly what components they intend to inspect prior to commissioning. Is it limited to the turbine casing, compressor casing, CDC, combustion cans, diffuser tunnel, etc? Clearly, there must be specific areas of interest. Certain parts may be challenging to inspect with a boroscope when the unit is closed, but initial assessments can provide valuable insight, especially in assessing corrosion or cleanliness for further inspection upon unit opening. It would also be helpful to know the class of units in question (E, FA/B, H).</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The E-class units are prone to extensive corrosion, particularly in the compressor sections. The lack of regular rotor maintenance over the past 3 years increases the risk of rotor bending. Borescope inspections of the compressor, combustor, and turbine sections are recommended to assess the status of the units, especially those linked to dehumidifiers. These inspections will provide valuable insight into the condition of the units and help prevent potential issues.</p>

            <p>Dealing with potential high-speed flying debris can be a challenge. While storing equipment with seals and covers intact may seem sufficient, there is always a risk of unforeseen problems arising. It's important to ensure that there won't be any issues before proceeding. I recommend sending the equipment to a certified testing facility that is independent from the manufacturer. Although it may be an unexpected expense, it's better than dealing with the consequences of a critical failure down the line. Remember, it's better to be proactive and avoid potential headaches in the future.</p>

            <p>I acknowledge that I am at their mercy. The items were carefully wrapped and stored in a climate-controlled environment. Addressing concerns about shaft bending proves to be a challenge. If we determine that there is indeed shaft bending, what steps should be taken to rectify it? One common solution involves using either hot or cold shaft turning. Do you have any alternative suggestions? The closest testing facility may be located in either South Africa or Europe.</p>

            <p>The process will be similar, as they will crank the engine without fuel post-boroscoping. They will closely watch the vibration patterns during start-up and idle to determine its condition within approximately 2 hours. Inform them about the engine's storage and preservation status, as their start-up protocols will address any other potential issues.</p>

            <p>Emeka, I had the same thoughts regarding shaft sag. If the shaft is sagging, should it be removed and taken to a repair shop, or can it be turned the other way to let it settle over time? If it can be turned, it should be put in gear for as long as possible to correct itself. I agree with the importance of not risking your career by neglecting broken turbine buckets. It's not worth it. It may be necessary to do more than just a boroscope inspection as recommended. Some issues may be challenging to spot with a scope. While I don't have direct experience with the 9E, similar to a smaller FA, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to see the later compressor and stator stages. Generally, conducting an inspection by lifting a compressor or turbine casing is a minor task compared to replacing damaged parts. It is crucial to have a skilled technician operate the scope to assess the equipment's condition accurately. However, if they are requesting the rotor to be removed, that is a completely different situation. In my opinion, lifting the casings would be the best course of action.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, the boroscopic inspection was completed at a site containing two turbines. Overall, everything appeared to be in good condition, with only small amounts of corrosion detected on certain compressor and turbine blades. The recommendation is to proceed with the cold wash procedure to address this issue.</p>
