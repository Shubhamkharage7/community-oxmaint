                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I encountered some issues with Windows updates requiring a restart, specifically affecting internet access while allowing network access. While working on a RSL500 project and needing to go online with the PLC on my workbench, I faced another Windows Update Restart Required notification. Despite being busy, I delayed the restart. When I attempted to go online using RSLinx, I noticed some abnormalities with the devices on the network. The program indicated that the RSLinx Linx Gateway was incorrectly installed and not functioning properly. Even after trying different methods to resolve the issue, including repairing the installation through Control Panel, the problem persisted. It turned out that Windows was blocking communication to prompt a reboot, which previously only impacted internet browsing. After the forced reboot, RSL500 was able to go online quickly as expected.</p>

            <p>I strongly dislike the Windoze operating system. To ensure the security of my data, I store everything on isolated virtual machines that are completely offline, thus eliminating the risk of any unauthorized updates.</p>

            <p>In a Reddit post, user robertmee expressed frustration with Windows operating systems, preferring to keep his files secure on isolated virtual machines without internet access to avoid updates. He mentioned considering switching to Linux as his host OS but hesitated due to being the only employee knowledgeable about Linux at his company. With a heavy workload, even if his boss approved the switch, he's unsure when he would make the transition.</p>

            <p>I have never experienced the entire networking stack being disrupted by an update service. However, a single update can cause networking issues. To stop the update service from downloading updates, set the network interface to metered. Additionally, clearing out the softwaredistribution directory can prevent leftover items from being applied repeatedly by the local service. Search for instructions on temporarily stopping the wuauserv to delete the directory effectively.</p>

            <p>Vadoola mentioned being interested in persuading their manager to allow them to set up Linux as their main operating system. They hesitated due to being the sole Linux-savvy employee at the company, unsure of their boss's reaction. With a busy workload, timing for the switch is also a concern. Many companies tend to have a collection of old PCs in their server or storage rooms. It may be worth asking your manager for an old computer, setting it up with a monitor on the side of your desk, and gradually transitioning to Linux at your own pace before making it your primary OS.</p>
