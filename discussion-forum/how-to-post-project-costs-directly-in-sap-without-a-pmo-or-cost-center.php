                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I need some guidance on how to post project costs to a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in SAP without using a Project Management Office (PMO) or cost center. I am currently using CJ9CS to reconcile planned costs with actual costs for specific periods. Recently, there was a request to update planned costs in SAP to align with actual costs for periods 1-6. When I enter the project number and relevant periods into CJ9CS, it is meant to adjust the planned costs to match the actual costs. However, I am encountering a warning message indicating that certain costs, such as those related to PMOs, cannot be changed as SAP considers them 'secondary' costs. From my research, it seems that the issue lies in the way PMO costs are treated. If there was a way for me to directly input time against the project without involving a PMO, I believe this problem could be resolved. I do not have access to the IMG and am only an end user. I apologize if this is not the correct section for my query. Thank you.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In order to accurately reflect actual costs in the project management office (PMO), it is essential to confirm planned costs through a PM confirmation and goods movement process. It is important to settle the actuals to the project in order to maintain accuracy. Making changes to planned costs in SAP after orders are released is not feasible, as the estimated amount is a commitment to expenditure. If you have a query regarding cost posting to a project, more details such as goods movements and time confirmations would be helpful.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  How can project costs be posted to a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in SAP without involving a Project Management Office (PMO) or cost center?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: To post project costs directly to a WBS in SAP without PMO or cost center involvement, you may need to explore options for adjusting planned costs to align with actual costs within the CJ9CS transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Why am I encountering a warning message when attempting to adjust planned costs in SAP using CJ9CS for periods 1-6?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The warning message you are receiving may be related to SAP treating certain costs, such as PMO-related expenses, as 'secondary' costs that cannot be changed directly. This issue might be due to how PMO costs are handled within the system.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Is it possible to input time against a project in SAP without the need for a PMO's involvement?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: If you are facing challenges with PMO-related costs, there may be a way to resolve the issue by finding a method to input time directly against the project without requiring PMO intervention. This could potentially help in adjusting planned costs to match actual costs more effectively.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4.  How can an end user address the issue of adjusting planned costs in SAP without IMG access?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: As an end user without access to the IMG, it may be helpful to collaborate with SAP administrators or consultants to explore alternative solutions for updating planned costs</p>
