            <p>When it comes to asset management, it's crucial to start at the design and installation phase to prevent defects. Involvement in new projects is key to defending reliability. For existing assets, view every event as an opportunity to resolve issues permanently and avoid being stuck in a cycle of repairs. Analyze defects thoroughly to identify root causes and address various factors contributing to them. Focus on achieving precision in all aspects of asset maintenance, from components to organizational factors. Invest in training and credentials to build confidence and influence. Emphasize defect prevention over detection mastery for long-term success. Our team is here to support you on this journey. For more information, contact Mike Barkle at mikebarkle@infralogix.com.</p>

            <p>Hello Mark, I found your advice very valuable and will definitely remember it. The idea of "fixing it for the last time" really struck a chord with me. Thank you for sharing your insights.

When I first started in asset management, I wish I had focused more on preventing defects from the beginning rather than just dealing with inspections. It's crucial to address issues during the design, procurement, and installation phases to ensure reliability. By identifying and correcting the root causes of defects, such as component, human, and organizational factors, we can achieve lasting solutions.

Emphasizing precision and maintaining high standards in equipment maintenance is key. Training and gaining qualifications will boost confidence and influence, ultimately leading to better defect prevention strategies. It's essential to shift focus from simply detecting faults to actively preventing and eliminating them.

For those starting out in asset management like myself, seeking advice and guidance from experienced professionals can be extremely beneficial. Your expertise and support are greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Bo Buuron

            <p>When investigating equipment failures, it's crucial to look beyond the immediate event and consider a broader timeline. Often, final failures are preceded by early indicators known as "sentinel" events, which signify damage or faults. For example, at my facility, a steam turbine generator began tripping on high vibrations when the load was increased. This occurred multiple times before we took action. Upon closer inspection of the long-term vibration trends, we discovered over a hundred vibration events dating back to the machine's installation. It was revealed that the rotor was flexing due to the casing's inability to accommodate thermal growth, causing damage to the sealing strips. Similar issues had been identified years earlier but were only temporarily repaired without a thorough investigation. Ultimately, it was determined that the casing was distorted from pipe strain during installation, and the pedestal needed reconstruction due to improper curing of the grouting. By delving deeper into the failure instead of just replacing parts, significant costs and lost profits could have been prevented. Take the time to analyze defects to identify root causes and focus on prevention rather than detection. Training and gaining credentials will boost confidence and influence in asset management practices. By addressing issues early on and adopting a proactive approach to maintenance, you can avoid costly mistakes and ensure the longevity of your equipment.</p>

Original Message: 
John Kozlowski, Senior Machinery Technologist at Syncrude Fort McMurray AB, shared some valuable insights on fault detection. He emphasized the importance of examining a broader time frame when investigating equipment failures to identify early indicators of potential issues. By delving deeper into the root causes of failures, significant costs and lost profits can be avoided or minimized.

When starting out in asset management, it is crucial to focus on preventing defects at the design, procurement, and installation stages. Mike Barkle advised aspiring professionals to analyze defects thoroughly and address not only the physical components but also human and organizational factors contributing to the issues. By emphasizing prevention over detection, individuals can enhance reliability and efficiency in managing assets.

Bo Buuron expressed gratitude for the advice and shared his eagerness to learn from experienced professionals in the field. As he embarks on his journey in asset management, Bo seeks practical tips and insights to improve his fault detection skills and avoid common pitfalls. Your input and guidance would be highly appreciated as Bo navigates the complexities of asset management. Thank you in advance for your support.
