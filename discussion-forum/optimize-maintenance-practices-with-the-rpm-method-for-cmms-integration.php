                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Are you in need of a CMMS that can seamlessly incorporate the RPM method for work prioritization? The RPM method centers around the concept of "maintain" - to repair (R) and preserve (P). Key functionalities required from the CMMS include: 1. Categorizing work orders as "R" (Repair), "P" (Prevent), or "M" (Modify) to differentiate between repair work, preventive maintenance, and other tasks. 2. Ability to create new work orders for "R" or "M" type work, with "P" type work orders being automatically generated by the maintenance team. 3. Capability to generate blanket "M" work orders to monitor non-maintenance activities like planning, purchasing, and engineering. 4. Generation of detailed reports for each equipment piece, covering "R", "P", and "M" activities in terms of time and parts. 5. Generating specific reports for "M" work orders to track non-maintenance tasks, providing maintenance managers with crucial insights into equipment and staffing needs. For more information, refer to the Uptime article titled "RPM Method + RCM = Reliability". Fred Weber brings over 35 years of experience in the maintenance field and is a valuable resource for optimizing maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>If you're in the market for a CMMS that can implement the RPM method as the work priority system, consider checking out eMaint or Maintenance Connection. These platforms offer a range of features to meet your maintenance needs. Before making a decision, it's essential to schedule a demo to assess the fit for your organization. Questions to consider include the types of assets you have, the number of users requiring access, the industry you operate in, and whether you have an existing SAMP and reliability program in place. These considerations will help guide you in selecting the right CMMS for your needs. Stay organized and efficient with the RPM method, where maintenance activities are categorized as "R" (Repair), "P" (Prevent), or "M" (Modify) work orders. This classification system ensures that each maintenance task is clearly defined and tracked for optimal efficiency. Don't forget to generate reports for each equipment, detailing time and parts allocated for "R", "P", and "M" work orders. For more insights, refer to the Uptime article titled "RPM method + RCM = Reliability" by Fred Weber, a maintenance expert with over 35 years of experience. Trust in a CMMS that supports your maintenance operations and boosts reliability.</p>

The RPM method focuses on the word "maintain," combining repair and preservation tasks. A CMMS should be able to categorize work orders as "R" (Repair), "P" (Prevent), or "M" (Modify) activities. Additionally, it should offer the flexibility to create new work orders and track non-maintenance activities.

By generating detailed reports for each equipment piece, the maintenance manager can gain valuable insights into maintenance activities and personnel requirements.

            <p>When looking for an EAM/CMMS system, it is essential to ensure it has the capability to categorize work orders effectively. Consider key features such as user-friendly interface, mobile accessibility, seamless integration with other systems, top-notch security measures, customizable options, and easy accessibility. While we use Maximo, it might be too complex for organizations only in need of basic work management and asset history. Evaluate your organization's current and future needs to determine the most suitable option. Consider platforms like eMaint or Maintenance Connection for implementing the RPM method, which prioritizes maintenance activities based on repair, preserve, and modify tasks. This approach helps in tracking and managing maintenance activities efficiently. Don't forget to assess the types of assets you have, the number of users requiring access, industry specifics, and existing reliability programs. Stay informed and make an informed decision that aligns with your organization's goals.</p>

            <p>If you're in search of a reliable CMMS system, I highly recommend MVP from CMMS DataGroup. Having utilized various CMMS systems over the past two decades, I can confidently say that MVP is a top-notch program, especially if Maximo isn't an option for you. All CMMS platforms offer the basic capability to prioritize and categorize work types, making them suitable for your needs. Personally, I prefer a more specific structure for reporting ease, categorizing tasks as Preventative Maintenance (PM), Customer Requests (CR), Corrective Maintenance (CM), Corrective Orders (CO), and Compliance Preventative Maintenance (CPM).

If you're looking to implement the RPM method as your work priority system in a CMMS, it's important to ensure that the system can classify work orders as "R" (Repair), "P" (Prevent), or "M" (Modify) activities. Additionally, it should have the ability to differentiate between maintenance and non-maintenance tasks, track time and parts spent on each equipment, and provide valuable reports for equipment and personnel requirements.

For more information on implementing the RPM method in your CMMS, refer to the Uptime article titled "RPM method + RCM = Reliability." With over 35 years of experience in maintenance, I can attest to the importance of choosing the right CMMS system for your maintenance needs. Feel free to reach out for further information.

            <p>Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback. I am in search of a CMMS system that can effectively implement the RPM method to prioritize maintenance tasks within a plant setting. The RPM method emphasizes the importance of maintenance activities by categorizing them into Repair (R), Preserve (P), and Modify (M). With this approach, managers will receive daily reports highlighting equipment in need of repair, leading to increased work orders and timely maintenance actions. Purchase orders will be labeled with R, P, or M, ensuring top priority for repair-related orders. Engineering departments will focus on resolving repetitive repair work, while management will have data to support capital expenditure decisions. This method also enables better control over equipment repair conditions and work priorities. For further insights, I recommend reading the FREE book "Wrench Time...using the RPM method to manage maintenance" available at www.wrenchtime.com. Take care and stay safe, Fred Weber - Your Maintenance Management Expert with over 35 years of industry experience.</p>

            <p>Many CMMS options on the market can give you the ability to customize and streamline your maintenance processes. In my experience with MVP by CMMSData Group, I found that this platform allows you to tailor everything to your specific needs. From setting priority levels to creating work types, naming mechanisms, status, and workflow processes from scratch, you have the flexibility to design a system that works best for you.

Unlike other CMMS platforms, I did not feel limited to predetermined formats and titles. I have successfully implemented this CMMS at four facilities that previously did not use any maintenance management system. Now, we are fully committed to preventive and predictive maintenance using this platform.

If you are interested in learning more or seeing a demo, I highly recommend reaching out to CMMSData Group. Alternatively, feel free to contact me directly. I would be happy to connect and demonstrate how this CMMS has transformed our maintenance operations.

For more information on the RPM method and how it can optimize your maintenance processes, check out the free book "Wrench Time...using the RPM method to manage maintenance" at www.wrenchtime.com. With over 35 years of experience in maintenance management, implementing the RPM method has significantly improved our maintenance practices.

Original Message Sent: 07-13-2023 09:47 From: Fred Weber Subject: Implement the RPM method Thank you for your time and feedback. I have been searching for a CMMS that can revolutionize our maintenance practices. By applying the RPM method, we aim to prioritize repair and maintenance tasks effectively throughout our plant.

The RPM method involves categorizing work orders as "R" for repair, "P" for preventive maintenance, or "M" for modification. This system ensures that managers receive a daily report highlighting equipment in need of repair. Additionally, it streamlines the work order process for different departments, including operations, purchasing, engineering, management, and maintenance.

For more information on implementing the RPM method, I recommend reading the Uptime article titled "RPM method + RCM = Reliability" to see how this approach can enhance equipment reliability and maintenance efficiency.
