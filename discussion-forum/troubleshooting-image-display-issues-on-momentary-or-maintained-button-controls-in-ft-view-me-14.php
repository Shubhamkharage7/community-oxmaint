                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Have you encountered difficulties when trying to use images on Momentary or Maintained button controls? Every time I add an image, the button displays a white X or an error instead. It seems like the image won't show up properly. I have tried adjusting the Border to None and Backstyle to Transparent, but it still doesn't work as expected. I can manage to use arrow images with some tweaking, but it seems to remove the blue background and crop the arrow into place. I'm sure there's a simple solution to this, but the tutorials I've seen make it seem straightforward. Can you help me figure out what I may be missing here?</p>

            <p>I have not encountered any significant problems with View ME 14, just the usual quirks that come with using FT View ME over the years. What type of image file are you using that is causing an X to appear? Are you adding the image by right-clicking on Images in the Graphics section and selecting "Add Component into Project"? Or are you going to the image section of a button and choosing "Add from File" in the popup window? 
I have experienced some strange issues when using the "Add from File" option in the button image popup before. I prefer importing images from the graphics section of the project tree. 
I am not sure what you mean by cropping out the blue on the arrow images. Is image scaling enabled? Feel free to share a screenshot if needed.</p>

            <p>After designing PNG images in Photoshop, I imported them into my project for different states. While the images display correctly on the edit screen for state 1 and state 0, I encounter an issue when attempting to play the project. The button turns blue with an "Error" message, indicating that something is amiss. Though progress has been made since my initial post, this issue continues to be frustrating.</p>

            <p>JJG0701 mentioned that they have designed PNG images in Adobe Photoshop and added them to a list by right-clicking on the images. Although the selected PNG images appear on the editing screen for state 1 and state 0, an error occurs when clicking "Play," causing the button to turn blue with an "Error" message. This issue seems to be related to communication rather than the images themselves.

It is important to determine if the button is linked to an HMI Tag or directly to a PLC. If it is associated with an HMI Tag, consider whether it is a memory tag or a device tag. Ensure that the communication path is set up correctly to connect to the PLC if the button is linked to a PLC or device tag.

When running the project from the Designer and encountering the error, make sure that the communication path is configured for "Design (Local)" to connect to the PLC. If the issue arises while running the project on the PanelView, review the "Runtime (Target)" communication path settings. This adjustment may help resolve the error and prevent further issues.</p>

            <p>The button is connected to a PLC Tag and is successfully toggling the bool on the other side. However, I am facing inconsistencies with the images I have added. I have designed three images: a raised and a lowered beveled button to show its pressed state, and a hydraulic symbol that transitions from white to green when latched. Both images are in PNG format with the same dimensions, yet one set works while the other does not. Additionally, some random pre-loaded images from the library are functioning while others are not. Despite checking for errors, I am unable to pinpoint the issue, as all I see is a blue button with a white X icon.</p>

            <p>JJG0701 reported that they are experiencing issues with linking a button to a PLC tag. While some images appear to be functioning correctly, others are not. Despite creating three images with the same dimensions and file type (PNG), only one set works while the other does not. The error does not provide any helpful information, displaying only a blue button with a white X. It seems like a communication issue. Following suggestions from TheRooster and joseph_e2, it may be helpful to recreate the button, reboot the machine, and potentially provide a screenshot or the APA file for further analysis.</p>

            <p>After facing issues, JJG0701 found that restarting their device resolved the issue. They expressed their curiosity about why these tech troubles seem to persist. It's interesting how FactoryBalk seems to have learned from Microsoft, as both know how to cater to the basic human desire for conflict and struggle. It's a smart marketing strategy that resonates with modern society's search for challenges and solutions.</p>

            <p>JJG0701 mentioned that restarting the software seemed to resolve the issue, but expressed frustration over the recurring problems. Having worked with FactoryTalk for over 10 years, instability and recurring crashes have been common issues. Despite encountering instances where the program would crash and display corrupted data, a simple reboot usually fixes the problem. It would be helpful to understand why these issues persist.</p>

            <p>I first learned about the reboot trick when attempting to reconfigure a PV+ on a different -ENBT network within a ControlLogix system. Despite spending a significant amount of time trying to establish a new communication shortcut without success, I eventually gave up. Surprisingly, when I attempted it again the following day, it worked effortlessly on the first attempt. Remembering this experience, I tried rebooting the next time I encountered difficulties with changing the communication shortcut, and it resolved the issue. This occurred in RSView Studio versions 4.0, 6, and possibly 8. Rebooting has now become my go-to solution whenever technical glitches arise.</p>
