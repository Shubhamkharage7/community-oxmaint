                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am seeking recommendations and opinions on selecting a new UPS brand. I need to replace my aging 120V 50W Emerson Sola Industrial UPS, which is over a decade old and showing signs of failure. The new UPS will need to power two AB ControlLogix PLC racks, two IT/OT Ethernet switches, and various power monitoring equipment. I plan to pair it with a Zonit Industrial ATS switch for added reliability. Any advice or suggestions on suitable UPS brands would be highly valued.</p>

            <p>Phoenix Contact offers top-quality APC products that are reliable and durable. Their line of APC products is known for its exceptional performance and longevity, making them a popular choice for customers seeking high-quality power protection solutions.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While we once believed APC was satisfactory, our opinion changed after being underwhelmed by their performance for several years. Although I do not have extensive experience with the Eaton 9SX yet, our initial experience with it for a comparable use case has been favorable. I equipped it with an industrial gateway card for Modbus RTU and utilized a Click to monitor UPS status on a ControlLogix system. While I have not tried a Zonit yet, I am intrigued by the prospect. Do you plan on having two UPS units?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>5618 mentioned that while they used to trust APC, they have been disappointed with them for years. They recently switched to an Eaton 9SX for a similar application and have had positive initial impressions. They added an industrial gateway card for Modbus RTU and integrated it with a Click to monitor UPS status on a ControlLogix. Although they haven't used a Zonit product yet, they are now intrigued by it. They clarified that they will only have one UPS unit as their company standard is to use an ATS to run line power and UPS power in parallel, in case the UPS fails. They are considering trying out Zonit's Industrial mini ATS for their setup.</p>
