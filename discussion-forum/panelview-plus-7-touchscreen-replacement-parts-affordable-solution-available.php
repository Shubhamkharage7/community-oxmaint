                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>After accidentally breaking the glass on our new PanelView Plus 7 just two months post-installation, our vendor informed us that we couldn't purchase the necessary repair parts - namely the Touch Panel Glass and Protective Film FIT 1000 2711P-T10C22D9P-B - from them. However, they did offer to repair it for a steep price. Seeking a more cost-effective solution, we discovered the same parts listed online for a fraction of the cost. Has anyone had success using third-party parts for their PanelView Plus 7 repairs? Taking matters into our own hands, we decided to order the parts and attempt an in-house repair, following a tutorial we found on YouTube titled "How to Repair 2711P-T10C22D9P Panelview Plus 7 Protective film Touchscreen Panel LCD Display." #Allen-Bradley #PanelView 1000 Plus 7 Touchscreen Replacement 2711P T10C22D9P.</p>

            <p>Purchase a replacement panelview from Plccable.com for your repair needs. I successfully fixed a panelview by using a version from eBay, despite it not having an Allen Bradley (AB) label on the bezel. It is common for people to seek replacements from original manufacturers, as AB does not produce their own hardware. Remember to use electronics-safe silicone sealant when reinstalling the new glass, as this essential item is typically not included in replacement kits.</p>

            <p>Although I have not repaired a PV touch panel before, I have experience with repairing other types of panels. The cost of repairs can be high, but it can also be time-consuming. One situation that particularly frustrated me involved a Siemens TP panel with a smashed touch screen. Many companies said it couldn't be repaired because the touch panel was no longer in production due to ROHS compliance. The replacement offered by the machine supplier was significantly more expensive than a new unit. However, after researching and reaching out to the manufacturer, I was able to locate some old stock through their agents for a much more reasonable price. By purchasing and installing the replacement parts myself for just £50 each, along with an hour of my time, I was able to successfully repair the panel at a fraction of the cost quoted by repair companies. It was a simple and cost-effective solution compared to the alternatives, which ranged from £2,700 to £4,000.</p>

            <p>Arpus4KM mentioned that kits for replacement do not include small tubes. Thank you for the suggestion. We may look into providing small tubes as well. We currently have both the overlay and glass in stock and can ship them out today.
