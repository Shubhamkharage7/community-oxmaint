            <p>For those seeking to create visually striking messages with locally displayed text controlled by tag values, reminiscent of a multistage indicator feature in PV+, View Designer offers a solution with its Text Display feature. By specifying the tag and various text messages on the Animation Tab, users can customize their messages. It is important to note that these messages cannot contain embedded variables.</p>

            <p>Are you up for the challenge of creating a Local Message style display with 600 states? Let's delve into the process and details right here on PLCTalk.net. As an experienced FactoryTalk View user, I have tackled projects with View Designer and the PanelView 5000. One crucial question to ask is whether the display utilizes embedded variables in the text. If you're incorporating background, border, or text color animations, how many different conditions are you considering? Consider using a transparent Text Display object over an animated Rectangle object to manage backgrounds and borders effectively. Running 600 unique text strings may pose runtime, storage, or performance challenges. I'm keen on exploring the impact of a large Text Object expression on terminal performance using runtime status tags. In View Designer, the List Box indicator holds the most text within the object, which can be condensed to a single visible line if needed. To check feasibility, you can indeed paste 600 comma-separated text strings into the Items field.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Ken Roach mentioned the challenge of designing a 600-state Local Message style display and invited discussion on the process and specifics on PLCTalk.net. As a seasoned FactoryTalk View user with experience in View Designer and PanelView 5000, Roach raised important questions about the display's use of embedded variables and the number of conditions for color animations. For efficiency, it may be simpler to overlay a transparent Text Display object on an animated Rectangle object to manage backgrounds and borders.

Roach acknowledged the potential runtime and storage implications of having 600 text strings and expressed interest in using runtime status tags to assess the terminal's performance with a large Text Object expression. In View Designer, the List Box indicator can hold the most text but can be condensed to one visible line if necessary. While Roach may not need all 600 messages, he is initiating a project to transition HVAC controls from a PC-based system to PLCs in the plant.

Roach emphasized the importance of structuring the programs for easy expansion and navigation, especially since he will be relocating soon. By assigning each equipment piece a range of line numbers in the text display, future additions can be seamlessly integrated. Additionally, Roach highlighted the convenience of having all faults and statuses in one ladder program for quick troubleshooting, a feature appreciated by both experienced and newer technicians.

In the absence of embedded variables, the text is primarily used for displaying alarms and system statuses on the main screen. Roach noted the absence of the alarm banner tool in View Designer but plans to utilize the text display for alarm messages, which will still be accessible on the alarm summary page.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>TVran mentioned that their OEM utilizes local message displays on some production machines to show alarms and machine statuses. In previous View versions, they shared the same list for both the local message display and the alarm list. If you are looking to achieve the same setup in View Designer, consider using the ALMD Instruction in Logix Designer. This instruction seamlessly links to the PV5000 series, making it easy to manage alarms and statuses without much effort in View Designer. Experiment with this feature to see how it can benefit your production process.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I have to admit, I didn't have the opportunity to thoroughly explore the alarm instructions, so my example may not be as polished. The main reason I utilized it is because it required minimal setup in the PLC, specifically the 5380 model. It should also be compatible with the 5370 and CLX models...</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>25-09-2024</span></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Padees mentioned that using the same list for both alarms and status is easily achievable with View Designer. In fact, there is no need to manually configure anything in View Designer if alarm instructions from Logix Designer are utilized. The ALMD Instruction automatically integrates with the PV5000 series, allowing for seamless operation. Feel free to experiment with it further. 

I have successfully set up ALMD instructions to showcase alarm texts sourced from a string array. Can these strings be utilized in a text display? I attempted to do so but encountered an error within the text display box. I am utilizing the hmiMessageNumBuff for the state changes in the text display.</p>
