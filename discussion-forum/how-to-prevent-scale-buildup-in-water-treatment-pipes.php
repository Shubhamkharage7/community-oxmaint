            <p>It is possible that scaling issues may be linked to inadequate water treatment. Process engineers can provide valuable assistance in addressing this issue. When referring to scales, are you talking about corrosion scales or mineral deposits? If there is not enough oxygen scavenging in the water, it can lead to corrosion and the formation of scales on carbon steel pipes. Mineral deposits come from the minerals present in the water, emphasizing the importance of a properly functioning water treatment/demineralization unit. My experience installing two boiler chemical injection skids has given me insight into these matters. Thank you.</p>

            <p>As a beverage bottling plant, we take the necessary steps to properly treat water before the production process. Our water treatment process involves several key steps, starting with the entry of municipal water into our facility. We carefully treat this water with lime, ferrous, and Chlorine to ensure its cleanliness and safety for consumption. The treated solution then undergoes settling at our clarifiers before being slowly pumped into a semi-treated tank. From there, the water is further processed through sand filters, carbon filters, and polishing filters before it is ready for production.

However, the semi-treated water may still contain particles that can accumulate on the walls of our pipes over time. This can potentially reduce the lifespan of the pipes and impact our overall production efficiency. If you have any insights or solutions on how we can prevent this build-up, particularly regarding the use of magnetic materials, we would greatly appreciate your input. Your expertise could help us maintain the integrity of our piping systems and improve our operational capabilities.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Best regards, Ajay.</p>

            <p>If you find yourself in this situation, it may be worth reaching out to a water treatment company for expert advice on removing unwanted particles while preserving essential minerals. Additionally, consider exploring the option of chemical cleaning if shutting down the unit is feasible, weighing the cost against pipe replacement. Determine the pipe material - Carbon steel or HDPE, and the piping design standard used (ANSI or national std). Evaluate the water velocity in the pipe to ensure it is fast enough to prevent particle settlement. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If I were in your shoes and working at a bottling plant for some years, I would recommend checking the lime dosing quantities. It's possible that there is a discrepancy between the lime dosing and settling tank capacity/nominal flow rate in this stage of the process. Additionally, both galvanised steel and stainless steel pipes are vulnerable to scaling issues. If you have stainless steel pipes, consider passivating the inner surface as a cost-effective alternative to replacing the pipes. This solution may require some investment but is much more budget-friendly than full replacement.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your insights, DC2. While my background is in the motor industry, I've been working in the beverage sector for approximately 2.5 years. Your observations on flow rates are indeed relevant, and I am delving into further research on this matter. It's possible that this could be the underlying issue impacting other aspects of water treatment. Here are a couple of queries for consideration: 1. Could over-liming lead to chlorine breakthroughs post-carbon filtration? 2.</p>

The results have been highly successful, with noticeable improvements typically visible within 2 to 3 months. I have included before and after photos for reference.
