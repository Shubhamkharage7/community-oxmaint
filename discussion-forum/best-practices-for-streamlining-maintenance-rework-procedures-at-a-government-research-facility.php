            <p>Have you established a clear definition for rework? Are you utilizing a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS)? In our organization, rework is defined as any recurring maintenance tasks completed within 3 months of their initial completion. In my experience, CMMS may lack the ability to easily identify rework tasks automatically. While CMMS can group work orders for the same equipment, it may not accurately distinguish rework based on failure codes alone. Therefore, manual analysis, comparison, and decision-making are necessary, along with confirmation from the individual responsible for the task. It is possible that other organizations have found more effective ways to manage rework processes.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, before we proceed further, have you established a clear definition of what constitutes rework? We are currently in the process of aligning our definition with yours, which involves the repetition of the same task within a specific timeframe. However, we are facing challenges in determining the most effective time period for this definition. We are considering a timeframe of three months as it seems reasonable. 

Regarding our CMMS system, we are transitioning from DataStream MP5 to Invensis. I have concerns about the effectiveness of a manual identification system in our plant. There are potential issues such as trades not reporting rework to avoid revealing errors, the labor-intensive task of screening thousands of work orders for rework evidence, and equipment owners being resistant to extra administrative work.

Given the complexities involved, I am curious if others have attempted to automate the rework identification process through CMMS. What obstacles have they encountered and have they achieved success? Your insights on this matter are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Interested in switching from DataStream MP5 to Invensis CMMS? Unsure of the effectiveness of a manual identification system at your plant? Concerned about trades not reporting rework due to a blame culture? 

It may be beneficial to have a maintenance planner or analyst screen data and involve trades in monthly maintenance meetings to address these issues. While processing thousands of work orders annually may seem daunting, screening them monthly for Key Performance Indicator (KPI) reporting could streamline the process. 

Consider entrusting this task to a maintenance planner and integrating it into monthly KPI reporting. Despite potential reluctance from equipment "owners," treating this process as essential can lead to improved maintenance overall. 

Have you tried automating the process through CMMS? Success may only come through a semi-automatic approach involving data screening and manual comparison between work orders. Share your experiences and challenges to collaborate and find effective solutions.</p>

            <p>Our approach to rework differs slightly from Josh's definition. In our process, equipment is returned to operations after maintenance for acceptance testing and reintegration into service. Operators assess the equipment's condition against specific performance standards, with assistance from the mechanic, and if it meets the criteria, it is put back into service. The work order is then closed with the equipment's history documented. If the equipment does not pass testing, the operator submits a rework request. This request is treated like any other work order, but with the rework designation and the original work order number included. For us, rework is necessary when equipment fails acceptance testing upon return to operations. If the equipment passes testing but subsequently malfunctions, it is considered a repeat failure. We monitor the number of rework requests by tracking those with the rework designation. We implemented a custom field for this designation, though it could also be achieved with a work type value adjustment.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your input thus far, team. I am a colleague of Derek Hooey, the original poster. Derek is currently working on another project, so I will be taking over this conversation. As mentioned earlier, we are transitioning to an Invensis system that can detect rework issues, making it easier to customize the business rules to meet our requirements. I believe assigning rework based on failed post-maintenance testing (PMT) and operational errors triggering the rework flag is a smart approach. When it comes to recurring failures, do you have a set timeframe (e.g. failing within X months) or is it determined by the specific task or equipment type?</p>

            <p>quote: In the realm of maintenance work, the debate often arises as to whether subsequent failures are linked to previous maintenance activities. This ongoing discussion has led to the conclusion that if a piece of equipment passes its acceptance test, then the maintenance work is considered complete. However, if a failure occurs during operation, a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) must be conducted to determine the underlying cause, which could potentially be attributed to subpar workmanship during the last maintenance cycle. This type of failure is classified as a repeat or premature failure, distinct from a typical breakdown. Ultimately, the decision-making process in these situations can vary, with no definitive right answer. The primary goal remains achieving zero rework and minimizing unexpected failures through addressing root causes. By focusing on identifying and rectifying these underlying issues, progress can be made towards optimal equipment performance.</p>

            <p>As mentioned by Wally, rework can sometimes arise well after the completion of maintenance work. An example of this is when I encountered a situation where a compressor was overhauled during a shutdown, only to later experience non-conformance issues due to gas recycling inside the compressor caused by a broken or sheared ring during installation. This highlights the importance of implementing a grace period, such as a 3-month cutoff from completion, to allow for proper handover and acceptance testing. By relying solely on operations to identify rework, there is a risk of misidentifying or overlooking issues, potentially causing tension between maintenance and operations.

To effectively address rework, the role of a maintenance planner or analyst is crucial. While using a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) to track rework is useful, it is essential to carefully analyze the data before sharing it, as discrepancies in coding or incomplete reporting can lead to inaccuracies. Regular monitoring of work completion through joint operation-maintenance meetings is key to ensuring early identification and resolution of rework issues.

In cases of disagreement on whether a task constitutes rework, the final decision rests with the maintenance manager. It is important to establish a shared understanding of what constitutes rework and to continuously learn and improve processes based on these experiences.</p>

            <p>In our process, a dedicated team member was assigned to review and approve all work requests. This crucial role falls under Operations, as this department is responsible for determining maintenance needs, prioritizing tasks, and calculating associated costs. While this approach may differ from conventional practices, it was effective in the specific context it was implemented. The team member was tasked with verifying if a flagged request indeed required rework. This verification process was robust, ensuring that work was completed satisfactorily and minimizing the need for rework. If any issues arose post-completion, they were classified as premature failures. This stringent yet effective protocol ensured that all maintenance work was done accurately and efficiently.</p>

            <p>Dear gentlemen, There has been extensive discussion on methods for identifying rework within projects. Regardless of the approach taken, the ultimate goal is to prevent rework from occurring. One of the critical areas to focus on is the development and adherence to detailed work procedures, specifically for dismantling and reinstallation processes. These procedures should encompass information on clearances, dimensions, and final alignment tolerances. It is essential that every major task, such as overhauls, is accompanied by a comprehensive report detailing the initial conditions, work completed, spare parts utilized (including material codes), and the final condition upon completion. In addition to the primary tasks, attention must also be given to auxiliary systems like the compressor, seal oil, and lube oil systems. Exposing these systems to atmospheric contamination during overhauls can lead to the ingress of harmful contaminants, potentially resulting in the need for rework. Best regards, Mohammad.</p>
