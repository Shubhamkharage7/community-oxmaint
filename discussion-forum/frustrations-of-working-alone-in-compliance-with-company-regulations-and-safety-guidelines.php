                    <p>There are moments when I yearn to have the freedom to work independently. Despite being a one-person department, company regulations and safety guidelines mandate that I have another person present while working. This can be inconvenient, especially when I need to conduct maintenance on a Saturday when the machines are inactive. Convincing a foreman to join me on a long weekend can be a hassle. It's frustrating to think that I have to rely on someone else to put in extra hours when most would prefer to relax. Just venting my frustrations. - Mike.</p>

            <p>As a solo team member, I have the flexibility to work independently. However, I am not permitted to catch up on my backlog outside of regular work hours unless the rest of the maintenance team is also working. This restriction is enforced to ensure fairness among team members. Just needed to vent my frustrations about this limitation.</p>

            <p>Hey Jonny, I totally understand where you're coming from. It can be challenging. I have the flexibility to work overtime, but I can only do it when there's another person in the plant during the week. It would be great if we had a man-lift available. Currently, I have to sit in a box on the forks of a forklift, which means I need someone else to drive me around and lift me to different places. Finding someone with a forklift license who is available can be difficult. Our facility produces continuous-process plastic, so despite its size (approximately 50,000 square feet), there are usually only 3 or 4 workers on the floor, in addition to myself. Each worker is assigned to a production line and there is a foreman overseeing operations. Having a man-lift would greatly increase my independence at work. Even if we had a ladder tall enough to reach the rafters, it wouldn't be a safe option for me. - Mike</p>

            <p>Ensuring workplace safety is paramount, and having a knowledgeable foreman present during my shifts not only provides a sense of security but also proves to be a valuable resource. While I am relatively new to working with plastic, having someone who understands machine operations can be a significant advantage in case of emergencies. Training the foremen to troubleshoot and fix machines themselves is crucial, especially since I cannot be present at all times due to the plant's multiple shifts. Empowering them to handle issues independently can save both time and money in the long run.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In a small plant with only one maintenance crew member, the foreman may have the opportunity to work closely with the crew. However, in a larger plant with a Maintenance Foreman overseeing multiple mechanics and electricians, it is impossible to be in multiple places at once. To monitor workers working alone effectively, there are several options that can be implemented:

1. The foreman can dedicate time after completing desk tasks to visit and monitor the work of crew members. The frequency of monitoring visits should be determined during Safe Work Permit evaluations. If the job is lengthy or poses certain risks, the foreman should increase their visits to the job area.

2. Equip each crew member with a two-way portable radio or cell phone and instruct them to report to the foreman or security every two hours. If a worker fails to report or answer calls, the Maintenance Foreman or security personnel should check on the area.

3. Check if there is a security camera available at the job site that can be positioned to monitor the working area. Security personnel can then monitor the worker from a central Command Post. This added layer of surveillance can help ensure safety and accountability for workers working alone.</p>

            <p>Metalworker Mike expressed a need for a man-lift instead of having to sit in a box on forklift forks, requiring someone else to operate it. This practice raises safety concerns and could lead to serious consequences at the workplace. It is important to follow safety regulations set by organizations like CCOHS and OSHA to avoid fines and potential harm. Sites that prioritize safety would not tolerate such risky behavior. It is crucial to have a trained and licensed forklift operator to ensure safety and compliance.</p>

            <p>I thought Mike was referring to commercially available personnel baskets used for fork trucks. Are those OSHA certified? Mike, I'm not familiar with your equipment, but it might be worth conducting a cost analysis. What is the expense of having someone accompany you with a fork truck? Alternatively, how much would it be to install permanent sensors connected to a junction box? In that case, a fork truck or manlift wouldn't be necessary. - David Eason</p>

            <p>Is it worth investing in a man lift, considering its cost? Implementing a man lift can not only ensure OSHA compliance but also improve overall workplace safety and efficiency, ultimately saving money in the long run.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering the purchase of a man lift, it is important to factor in various costs to justify the investment. This includes equipment price, shipping costs, annual maintenance costs, and any other associated expenses. By doing a proper cost analysis, you can determine if the benefits outweigh the expenses.

Potential costs to consider include OSHA fines that could be avoided by using a man lift, as well as the costs of production interruptions that could occur without the use of a man lift. Additionally, there may be costs associated with using a forklift instead of a man lift, such as delays in production or warehouse operations.

By weighing all of these factors and potential costs, you can make a well-informed decision on whether investing in a man lift is the right choice for your business. This evaluation can help you avoid unnecessary expenses and improve overall efficiency in your operations.</p>

            <p>There has been a surge of activity here recently. Let me provide some clarity on a few points - I am referring to the times when I enter the plant on a Saturday when it is vacant, with no one else around. There are no security guards, no production being carried out... it's like a deserted town. I wish I could perform maintenance during these times as some tasks require the machine to be shut down. Unfortunately, I am not permitted to be in the plant alone for maintenance. This is what I was frustrated about. I have to ask someone else to sacrifice their Saturday to supervise me while I work. Regarding the need for a man-lift, although it would be beneficial, it is unlikely due to the requirement of having someone else present on Saturdays. This individual can accompany me and assist in moving around. If the work is scheduled on a different day, everyone is usually occupied with tasks, making it difficult to find assistance. However, in urgent situations where a machine is down, an extra person not engaged in running machines could assist me. In relation to the forklift-mounted box, it is designed for lifting individuals. I once saw a picture of a large forklift lifting a smaller forklift, with people standing on it to work - quite risky. My forklift box is certified, but it lacks the convenience of a proper man-lift as the forklift cannot be operated from the box.</p>

            <p>When working alone in a factory on a Saturday, it's important to ditch the two-way radio and instead carry a cell phone with a list of emergency contact numbers such as 911, your family, your boss, and a coworker who is close by and has access to the factory. I once heard a story about a worker who was alone in a production room after working overtime and found themselves locked in when everyone else had left without noticing. To avoid a similar situation, always ensure you have a way to communicate with the outside world and have someone aware of your presence in the plant.</p>

Additionally, clarify with your employer if you are permitted to work alone in the plant during weekdays. Do you receive paid overtime for working on Saturdays, or is your dedication to your job the driving force behind your willingness to work on weekends?</p>

            <p>When dealing with a situation where someone is trapped inside, it is important to follow the proper confined space entry procedure. It is common for workers to display their worker pass outside before entering a confined space.</p>

            <p>Working overtime on Saturdays is a common occurrence for me, as I typically work over 40 hours during the week. However, I sometimes negotiate to have Mondays off instead. Although I do not have any subordinates, it is crucial for all foremen to enhance their understanding of the machines. This will improve their performance when working on weekends. Despite not needing to provide a reason for working on Saturdays, I do find it frustrating that I am required to have someone accompany me. While I may appreciate having assistance most of the time, it is frustrating not having the option to work alone due to the continuous manufacturing processes throughout the week.

This upcoming Saturday, I will be focusing on the main production line and strategizing on how to install remote greasing lines. It is currently unsafe to grease the machines while they are in operation, as they run 24/7. This issue highlights the need for increased safety measures. After inspecting the grease fitting thread sizes on all the bearings this Saturday, I will place an order for the fittings. Depending on shipping times, I will install them the following Saturday or the one thereafter. This installation will allow for greasing to be done from outside the machine, eliminating the need to be in close proximity to the hazardous equipment.</p>

            <p>quote by Josh: When someone is locked inside, the proper protocol for confined space entry should be followed. It is common for workers to display their pass outside before entering a confined space. A production area with a central hall and multiple rooms is not considered a confined space if it has a locked gate or door at the entrance. If that were the case, every location within a building would be classified as a confined space.</p>

            <p>Apologies, the correct terminology is secure or protected areas. A similar protocol should be implemented for access to the production zone, ensuring it is also secure. It is essential to have records of personnel entering and exiting these secure locations.</p>
