                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! I have recently taken on the role of reliability engineer at a chemical plant, specifically within the maintenance department. Prior to my arrival, there was no dedicated reliability staff, only a preventive maintenance team in place. To kickstart my work, I began by identifying the most critical rotating equipment in the plant. While I didn't conduct a formal equipment criticality analysis, I selected the top 50 high-cost equipment and also considered a list provided by the production team (another 50 units).

To effectively monitor these selected equipment, I established a vibration analysis route to be conducted weekly, with 20 pieces of equipment to be checked each day over 5 days. While this has been a good start, I am seeking suggestions on what additional steps to take beyond vibration analysis. The main equipment of focus includes compressors, pumps, fans, blowers, and agitators.

Do you have any recommendations or tips for me as I continue in this role? Wishing you all a Happy New Year! Peace.</p>

            <p>To optimize equipment performance, it is crucial to begin with a foundation of basic care and cleanliness. Implement a comprehensive lubrication strategy and analyze past failures to better understand your equipment. Identify and prioritize the top problematic components for elimination. Evaluate the effectiveness and adequacy of preventive maintenance procedures. Assess key performance indicators related to maintenance work management, focusing on rotating equipment. Consider potential upgrades or modifications to the major equipment package. Ensure that equipment is operated within its specified operating parameters. Effective collaboration between operations and maintenance is imperative for successful outcomes.</p>

            <p>Consider implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) for your rotating equipment packages. Additionally, conduct reliability modeling for your plant to determine its inherent/design reliability percentage. It is essential to ensure the reliability of not just your equipment but the entire plant. These tasks can be efficiently handled by external consultants.</p>

            <p>Josh, that's a solid list you've got there. When it comes to reviewing maintenance strategies, it's important to consider various formal processes like RCM, PMO, and FMEA. RCM is just one method among many. It's crucial to assess the level of reactive maintenance and identify breakdowns that could have been prevented through proper planning. Detailed modeling may not always be necessary - sometimes, simply spending a day with the right people can provide valuable insights into reliability needs. If needed, investing in modeling can be beneficial. External consultants often offer review processes, which can be a more efficient alternative to months of benchmarking. In my experience, there is a lot of similarity in industry reports, with scoring in various categories almost identical across different sites. Many mining companies initially used benchmarking for reliability programs, but eventually found it to be less effective as all sites faced similar challenges. Consider these points when evaluating your maintenance strategy.</p>

            <p>As the first reliability engineer in your company, it is crucial to prioritize increasing awareness and knowledge of equipment performance and reliability. Improvements in reliability do not happen on their own; it requires individuals who understand and prioritize reliability within the organization. Surround yourself with key individuals who can drive reliability improvements by addressing fundamental issues such as lubrication and cleanliness. Present the benefits of implementing these basic practices to all staff members, and secure strong support from upper management for success. Start by achieving early successes with small improvements to demonstrate the benefits. Later, delve into more advanced techniques such as RCM, RCA, and modeling. This comprehensive approach will lay the foundation for long-term reliability success.</p>

            <p>For an efficient and user-friendly report, it is recommended to present the data on a single sheet. This reduces the need to navigate through multiple sheets to identify problematic trends. To start off, prioritize identifying all critical equipment and closely monitor downtime data, both scheduled and unscheduled. Assess and report the availability performance of these crucial assets, as in a continuous process industry, availability is key to success. It's crucial to consider the timeframe for availability reporting, ensuring it reflects a reasonable duration. Consistent reporting ensures accurate insights, preventing misleading fluctuations in availability percentages. Your attention to these details will lead to more effective data analysis.
