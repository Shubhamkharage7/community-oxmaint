                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I'm facing a dilemma with installing the HMI on our machine and I've encountered some issues. The device in question is the Delta Model: DOP-107EG. Here are the methods I have attempted so far:
1. Attempting to connect to a laptop to upload all the data using the latest version of DOPSoft software resulted in an error message stating, "HMI terminates data transfer because screen data is prevented from uploading/downloading."
2. Trying to copy the HMI onto a flash drive in the system settings resulted in an error message stating, "Operation is not allowed."
3. Using an Ethernet cable on DOPSoft and FTP did not establish a connection, with the error message stating, "Connection Failed - the target machine actively refused it."
I have been struggling all day to resolve this issue and would greatly appreciate any assistance. Please let me know if you require any additional details.
Additional information:
- Firmware has been updated, but the HMI still cannot be copied.
- Attempted using CDC and DISK mode on USB Comm Mode settings.
- Have not tried using an RS232 connection as there are currently none available.</p>

            <p>It appears that the issue with uploading may be due to a lack of proper permissions or a password setting when the file was originally downloaded. Is there a way to bypass this restriction? Despite reaching out to the original programmer, they have unfortunately forgotten the password and no longer have the original copy of the HMI they programmed. This has posed a challenge in resolving the upload issue.</p>

            <p>When speaking with the original programmer, inquire about the possibility of using a commonly used password or password method. Consider trying potential identifiers such as job numbers, phone numbers, or frequently used phrases. As a model 107, it may be worth attempting these options. Additionally, testing the IP address and machine serial number could also provide valuable insights.</p>

            <p>It has been quite some time since I last worked on Delta HMI's, but I have noticed that the issue of passwords is not addressed in the OP's post. It seems that uploading from the HMI is strictly prohibited without the original source file, rather than requiring a password for access. In the absence of the original source file, you may find yourself unable to make any progress.</p>

            <p>If you're able to temporarily work without the HMI, here's a suggestion based on my experience. In the past, I've sent ProFace HMI's to their facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan to retrieve the program from the EEPROM and transfer it to a new HMI unit. I've encountered situations where a ProFace HMI malfunctioned entirely, but they were able to extract the program successfully. In cases where the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) went out of business and no support was available, this proved to be a useful solution. It might be worth reaching out to a Delta service center for assistance in a similar situation.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I apologize for not responding. As ASF mentioned, I am currently unable to access the HMI and upload the data. I wanted to provide an update on this issue for anyone who comes across this thread in the future - unfortunately, I have not been able to resolve the problem and still do not have access to the HMI. The company has agreed to send a new programmer to inspect the HMI and the machine.</p>

            <p>The HMI has implemented a restriction on uploads that can only be bypassed via internal hacking. By extracting and transferring the internal storage chip to another HMI with upload capabilities, the program can be accessed.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why am I receiving an error message stating "HMI terminates data transfer because screen data is prevented from uploading/downloading" when trying to connect the Delta DOP-107EG to a laptop using DOPSoft software?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> This error message may indicate a restriction in the HMI settings that prevents uploading or downloading screen data. Check the HMI configuration settings to ensure that data transfer is enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  What does the error message "Operation is not allowed" mean when attempting to copy the HMI onto a flash drive on the Delta DOP-107EG?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> This error message suggests that there may be restrictions or limitations set on the HMI preventing operations like copying onto a flash drive. Review the system settings and permissions to enable such operations.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How can I troubleshoot the "Connection Failed - the target machine actively refused it" error message when trying to establish a connection using an Ethernet cable and FTP on DOPSoft with the Delta DOP-107EG?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> This error message usually occurs when the target machine actively rejects the connection. Check the network settings, firewall configurations, or any security measures that may be blocking the connection. Ensure that the correct IP addresses and ports are used for the connection.</p>
