                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello! I'm excited to have discovered this informative forum and have recently become a member in order to gather insights for a project. I am a final year student currently working on the finishing phase of my project, which involves creating a maintenance plan for a machine building company. The company has been tasked with maintaining a customer's machines, despite lacking prior experience in maintenance. In order to fulfill this request, they have initiated a project to develop maintenance lists and schedules using the Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) method.

The goal is to move beyond theoretical knowledge and obtain real-time data on the machine's performance at the customer's plant, including downtime and reasons for any interruptions. This valuable information will enable the optimization of maintenance schedules. My role is to establish a system for collecting and communicating this data within our company, utilizing various sources such as the machine's interface, machine operators, and technical staff, as well as potentially PLC data.

My plan involves: 
1. Identifying the necessary information for optimizing maintenance schedules 
2. Identifying the sources of information available (e.g. machine interface, operators) 
3. Developing a system for distributing information 
4. Exploring the possibility of accessing real-time data and addressing potential challenges 
5. Researching potential software programs, such as CMMS systems like Datastream or Maximo, to recommend for implementation.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this plan. Should the order of the above points be rearranged? Any recommendations for books or resources to further enhance my understanding of this topic would be welcome. I look forward to engaging with this forum over the next few months as I delve deeper into this project. - Wouter from the Netherlands</p>

            <p>Hello Woeter, I suggest segmenting the machine by locations to easily document downtime with assigned codes. This way, you can pinpoint the most troublesome areas of the machine. Utilizing this data will greatly benefit your Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) strategy. Regards, Mike.</p>

            <p>Hello Woeter, it's important to have a well-organized template for service reports in which technicians can document their findings during preventive and corrective maintenance. This should include details such as the Failure Mode, Failed Parts, Failure Mechanism, Cause, Activities, and corresponding descriptions. By keeping detailed records like these, you can easily update your RCM in the future, regardless of the system you decide to use. It is also beneficial to attach this document to your invoices to clearly outline the work done for the customer. Check out this forum for a wealth of valuable information. Best of luck, Rogier.</p>
