                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Following software updates, we upgraded our systems to FactoryTalk Service Platform 6.31 and applied a patch roll up on Dec 22. Our network-connected Alarm and Event DB, which has been functioning without issues for years, started experiencing problems after the update. While active alarms are working as expected, the alarm history stopped logging after the upgrade from FTSP 6.30 to 6.31. An error message in the event viewer appears every couple of minutes indicating an issue with executing SQL statements. This problem is affecting both older FTView SE ver 12 Network Station HMI's and newer FTView SE Network Distributed HMI systems. Although we have reviewed relevant Knowledgebase articles, we have not found a solution specific to our version of FTSP (6.31) or the error message we are encountering. If anyone has encountered similar issues following software updates, we would appreciate any insights or suggestions.</p>

            <p>Encountering database connectivity issues? Make sure to review the paths. If you're unfamiliar with Alarms and Events, navigating to the communications tab in the project and runtime settings, similar to FT View Studio, is a good place to start troubleshooting the path verification.</p>
