                    <p>During the processing operation, I encountered a problem with the Power Flex 525 VFD suddenly stopping. Despite the PLC and VFD connections being confirmed as functioning properly, the VFD shows no faults. The PLC commands are being received by the VFD, but it is not running and there is no output frequency feedback or current. Can you provide me with any advice or solutions for this issue? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Are you able to verify the status of your drive with code b006? This will allow you to ensure the safety of the equipment. Additionally, it is important to review the b012 Control Source to confirm that the start and frequency sources are correctly set. Make sure to also check that the stop jumper is properly installed at Pin 11-1 for optimal performance.</p>
