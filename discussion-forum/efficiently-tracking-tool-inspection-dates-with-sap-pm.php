                    <p>Are you struggling with managing inspection dates for your tools? Our shopfloor staff relies on numerous tools that require annual inspections. We are looking for a streamlined process to track the next inspection date for each tool, with a reporting feature that allows us to view upcoming inspections, such as those scheduled for the next month. When an inspection is completed, we need a system in place to update the next inspection date to one year from the current date. Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Once the data has been set according to steps 1-4 in the previous response, the Maintenance Planner is required to approve the scheduled orders for the upcoming month. Using transaction code IW39, you can generate a report detailing the orders and inspections scheduled for the following month. This process ensures proper planning and maintenance of equipment.</p>

            <p>When it comes to handling tools, the typical procedure is to view them as equipment and follow a regular plan for inspection and maintenance. However, if the inspection process, such as third-party calibrations, takes 1 to 3 months (including logistics and transportation), it can result in your next work order being scheduled earlier by the same amount of time. This means that your tools will still be valid for 1 to 3 months longer than initially expected. This can impact accuracy and efficiency in your operations.</p>

            <p>I employ this method for instrument calibration, but our process states that if a previous yearly calibration was conducted on a specific date (e.g. 02JUNE2005), it remains valid until the end of the month or 30JUN2006. This allows for some flexibility in our planning and scheduling.</p>

            <p>To streamline the process, consider setting up a maintenance plan that generates notifications for inspection dates, instead of orders. This way, the workshop can easily identify and complete the necessary tasks without having to dig into the history or costs associated with the job. This system is especially useful for operator tasks where the focus is solely on completion. By utilizing this method, you can prioritize efficiency and ensure all necessary maintenance is completed in a timely manner.</p>

            <p>Working in the pharmaceutical industry requires strict adherence to government regulations such as the FDA's 21CFR211, also known as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). These regulations must be followed not only in the United States but also in other countries where our products are sold. Aligning with the FDA's requirements is comparable to meeting ISO 9000 certifications.

Under GMP guidelines, written procedures are necessary for all processes that impact the quality of pharmaceutical products, including equipment maintenance and instrument calibration. These procedures must be approved by management and the Quality Assurance (QA) department. For example, when setting an expiration date for calibration, it should be calculated based on specific criteria to ensure accuracy.

Our company's procedures have undergone thorough inspections by regulatory agencies from various countries like the USA, Europe, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. So far, there have been no issues or comments on our compliance with these standards.</p>

            <p>An issue arises when managing calibration as part of a maintenance plan in SAP PM, as it does not accurately trigger work orders based on calibration expiration dates. For example, if a yearly calibration expires on June 30, 2006, the next work order is set for June 30, 2007. However, if the instrument is sent out for calibration and the new validity date given by the third party is September 30, 2006, the calibration will actually expire on September 30, 2007. This results in a discrepancy of 3 months between the work order trigger date and the calibration validity date. This mismatch can lead to inefficiencies and inaccuracies in maintenance scheduling. How can this issue be effectively resolved to ensure alignment between work orders and calibration dates?</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, are you wondering how to maintain a one-year calibration program? My advice is to adjust parameters in the maintenance plan scheduling, specifically setting the Shift factor for late completed and early completed to 100%. This way, when you complete a work order, you can input the calibrated finish date in the Reference date. The system will then recalculate the next due date from this point onward. I hope this helps address your question.</p>

            <p>Martin inquired to David about adding a brief description of the work done in a text format. He emphasized the importance of using codes for detailed data analysis, as analyzing text entries can be challenging due to inconsistencies in data input. By utilizing codes in SAP notifications, you can effectively analyze data and generate reports on Mean Time Between Failures and Mean Time To Repair. The notification screen offers various coding fields, text entry options, and the ability to attach files. This flexibility allows for comprehensive data analysis and reporting.</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, I wanted to let you know that I have tried the scenario with aromatics multiple times and it has proven to be effective. Make sure to include input for the Tolerance fields in the scheduling parameters to indicate when the system should adjust the entire cycle. Depending on the tolerance factors you set up, the plans will shift according to your shift factor if the work order finish date goes beyond the specified tolerance. This should provide some guidance and assistance.</p>

            <p>David, I had the opportunity to try out your proposal and I am quite impressed (it appears to be the most straightforward way to conduct maintenance/calibration with PM). I have a few additional inquiries to fully grasp your situation: 1. How can I access the pop-up window in the activity report to attach files? 2. You mentioned that simply tagging the notification is sufficient without opening it. Could you provide the specific transaction for this? 3. Can I record the time required for calibration in an activity report? 4. Is there a report available that shows which equipment needs calibration next month? Thank you! Best regards, Martin</p>

            <p>Martin, I am currently using SAP Version 4.7, so the solutions I provide are specific to this version and may not apply to other versions with different features.

1. To access the pop-up window in the activity report for attaching files, simply click on the "Services for Object" button located in the top left corner of the notification screen next to the page header.

2. Regarding tagging notifications without opening them, this can be done through the Notification list editing change transaction (IW28). Simply select the notifications to be completed, then choose the "Complete" option either by clicking the chequered flag icon or through the menu.

3. Documenting the required calibration time in an activity report may not be straightforward. One option is to attach a task list, but this may only be beneficial if the notification is converted into an order. Alternatively, for informational purposes, you can include the time in the short or long text of the notification.

4. For a report showing which equipment needs calibration in the next month, you can utilize the Maintenance Planning feature. Go to Scheduling for Maintenance Plans, then select Scheduling Overview followed by List (Transaction IP24). This will provide you with the necessary information.</p>

            <p>David, I appreciate your valuable tips which have been very helpful. To avoid monotony, I have a couple of new queries for you: 

1. Is there a way to automatically generate the next maintenance notification once the current one is closed, instead of manually scheduling it every time with transaction IP10?

2. When scheduling (IP24), how can I filter to only display notifications that are still pending action? For example, if I have 50 equipments to maintain in August but have already completed 20 by the end of July, how can I generate a list showing only the remaining 30 open notifications for August?</p>

            <p>Inquiring about scheduling maintenance notifications? Wondering if you can automatically generate the next notification after closing one? Using transaction IP02, adjust call control parameters to set up automatic notification generation in maintenance plans. By setting the call horizon to 0%, the next maintenance call will be automatically created when the previous one generates a call object. You can also set a 'completion requirement' to ensure the next object is only generated once the previous one is completed. To manage call object generation, use transaction IP30, Deadline Monitoring, where you can schedule multiple due maintenance calls simultaneously. Remember to press the F1 key for SAP help notes and access detailed information from the SAP Application help. When scheduling in IP24, select open notifications by including a blank notification number in your criteria to view incomplete notifications for a specific period. Ensure your scheduling period is set correctly in the maintenance plan call control parameters to see all upcoming maintenance calls. Deciphering SAP-related queries can be challenging, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be simplified.</p>

            <p>David, you are excelling in your work, keep it up! Explaining SAP challenges can be tricky, so let's keep practicing. I have encountered an issue with transaction MCI5 (Damage Analysis). After documenting activities in a notification and completing it, the activities do not appear in the damage analysis. However, when I put the notification in progress again, the executed activities show up in the report. Any insights on why this might be happening?

Additionally, I am looking to analyze whether workshops are sending equipment on time and determine any delays in equipment arrival for maintenance. Is there a method to track this by comparing the required start date with the notification progress date? Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find the notification progress date in transaction IW28. Any suggestions on how to approach this analysis would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>Hello, I have a quick question: Is it possible to receive real estate notifications for equipment in addition to functional locations? Currently, my system only offers notifications for functional locations. Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>It is conceivable that ITwise that the fixed location (FL) remains constant while the equipment can be replaced or become outdated. This is similar to real estate properties A, B & C, which stay in their designated plots but may have their buildings demolished and replaced with new structures. The FL/plot stays unchanged unless the plots are merged to create a larger building, resulting in a new FL and equipment. This demonstrates how assets can remain but their surroundings can change, highlighting the importance of strategic planning and decision-making.</p>

            <p>To streamline the process, consider organizing tools that require inspection as Materials with a designated expiration date. By setting them up this way, you can easily track inspection dates through reports and transition to a new batch once inspections are completed. This method simplifies the process and ensures tools are regularly checked for safety and compliance.</p>

            <p>Dear Martin, 

At our long-standing Petrochemical plant, we have successfully implemented a strategic maintenance process for over a decade using our statutory test equipment. Following the advice of Luke's father, I recommend the following steps: 

1) Establish a single Functional Location (F/Loc) 
2) Develop individual Equipment Classes, Equipment Catalogues, and Equipment Masters 
3) Implement a yearly maintenance strategy, either by creating a new one or utilizing an existing plan 
4) Create a general task list for common equipment 
5) Develop specific equipment lists for unique machinery 
6) Create Maintenance Plans as needed, ensuring that minimum scheduling parameters are met 
7) Schedule plans accordingly, beginning a year prior to the desired start date 
8) Conduct weekly DeadLine monitoring using IP30 for a duration of 30 days 
9) Avoid releasing work orders (REL cards) until scheduled and all necessary resources are confirmed 
10) Release work orders as scheduled and required 
11) Utilize Activity Type Notifications to document maintenance history 
12) Use Equipment Class Catalogues for standardized reporting purposes 
13) Techically Complete (TECO) orders and close notifications once jobs are finished 
14) Close orders after payments have been processed 

Additionally, setting the settlement rule period to FUL can greatly simplify procurement processes. 

Best of luck with your endeavors.

            <p>Hello Martin, Your inspection process aligns with common practices in SAP PM, so let's dive into the necessary tools. Each tool will require its own maintenance item and maintenance plan. When adding the task list to the item, navigate to the Scheduling tab on the plan. Set the call horizon to approximately 80% (generating the work order about 3 months before the planned date) and the scheduling period to 365 days to view upcoming inspections for the next year. Check the "Completion Requirement" box to ensure the next inspection date is calculated based on the completion of the previous one. If you wish to report upcoming inspections, use IP24 to view calls that are due within the designated scheduling period. To confirm completed inspections, generate an M3 Activity report for each inspection and establish a unique code to indicate completion. For reporting purposes, utilize IW65. I trust this information is helpful. Best regards, Graham</p>
