            <p>I have extensively researched redundancy setup, but I am still unclear on the download process. The instructions state to treat the primary rack/processor as a single non-redundant system in RS Logix. Does this mean that when I download to it, my process will stop as usual, or will the secondary rack seamlessly take over? How smooth will this transition be?</p>

            <p>Contr_Conn mentioned that it is possible to make online edits and import Routines, AOIs, and rungs without halting the system. However, downloading is not possible while the system is running. After downloading, it is recommended to wait for synchronization before putting the system back online or switching it to Run Mode.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When downloading new content, is it necessary to wait for synchronization before going back online or entering Run Mode? In my experience, if the controller was synchronized prior to the download, it should remain synchronized both during and after the download process. However, if there are any issues with your program changes, synchronization may be lost after the download. Keep in mind that the amount of downtime needed before the download may vary depending on your setup and application. If downtime is not acceptable, consider using a partial import instead of starting the download immediately.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Have you ever experienced long download times for programs, taking hours or even days? This may be due to the redundancy setup in place. Despite having large programs, such as L85's, which are nearly full, downloads typically only take about 20 minutes. If you're unfamiliar with how partial imports work, you're not alone. This feature may be reminiscent of RS Logix 5, but many struggle to fully grasp its functionality.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to downloading files, redundancy may take slightly longer than non-redundant downloads, requiring some extra cross-loading time. However, this does not necessarily mean that your program will not function as intended, as redundancy ensures a more reliable outcome. Be prepared for a potential shutdown, but if you're lucky, the process will go smoothly.</p>

            <p>Tim Ganz mentioned that he is unfamiliar with the concept of partial import, recalling a similar feature in RS Logix 5 but never fully grasping it or having the opportunity to test it out. Partial import is actually quite user-friendly and can be easily implemented. To achieve "Bumpless operation" with a new routine, follow these steps: 

1) Import the new routine with program changes in the PLC task without adding a JSR to it yet, keeping the code inactive on the processor.
2) In online edit mode, create a new boolean variable "EnableNewRoutine" and set it to 0.
3) Modify the call to the affected code in the main program of your task as shown below:
4) When prepared, switch EnableNewRoutine to ON.
5) Conduct any necessary troubleshooting to activate new sections of the code.</p>
