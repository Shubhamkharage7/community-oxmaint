                    <p>Hello everyone, I have been working on setting up AssetCentre to back up FactoryTalk View SE. In order to do this, I restored a backup from an application and during the process, I selected the option to copy the FactoryTalk Directory. However, it seems that choosing this option has caused an issue in the AssetCentre Client, as I keep receiving an error message when trying to open it. I am unsure how to resolve this issue. Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>If you are seeing an error message stating your client computer is not connected to the same FactoryTalk Directory as your AssetCentre server, it could be because the Client is running on a different PC than the server. Alternatively, if they are on the same PC, restoring may have removed all existing FactoryTalk credentials. To resolve this issue, run the Specify FactoryTalk Directory Location tool on the Client PC. This tool will help connect your client computer to the same FactoryTalk Directory used by AssetCentre.</p>

            <p>If you are using the same PC, the tool may not be needed. It seems like the FactoryTalk credentials on your PC were replaced when you restored your View SE application. I recommend running the FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard and choosing both Local and Network Directories. When asked for a username, be sure to enter the Windows account username with Admin privileges and its password. If you choose both options, you will need to enter the username and password again. This is the step I suggest taking. OG</p>

            <p>Operaghost recommended running the FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard to resolve issues with overwritten FactoryTalk credentials in View SE application. Ensure to select both Local and Network Directories and input the Windows admin account's username and password. If prompted again, re-enter the same information. It's worth trying this troubleshooting step.</p>

            <p>Operaghost suggests that if you are using the same PC, you may not need the tool. It is possible that the FactoryTalk credentials on your PC were overwritten when you restored your View SE application. To resolve this issue, try running the FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard and select both Local and Network Directories. Input the user name and password for the Windows account with Admin privileges when prompted. If you select both Local and Network directories, you will be asked to enter the user name and password again. If this doesn't resolve the issue, it may be necessary to troubleshoot further.</p>

            <p>If you are searching for solutions to a similar issue, The Technote identifies four potential causes: 1. FTDirectory, 2. Service stuck or stopped, 3. Codemeter malfunction, and 4. Expired activation. I encountered this problem and resolved it by rebooting the server, as the FTAC Service had not loaded the Server Activation.</p>
