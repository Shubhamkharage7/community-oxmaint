                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>A client requested our assistance in semi-automating their machine that utilizes a 115" ball-screw to move a carriage back and forth. While I have a general idea of how to approach this automation task, the devil lies in the details. I am considering installing an encoder on the ball-screw to accurately track the carriage's position. With limited resources at hand, I have shared images of the machine's end to show where the encoder could be mounted. By securely attaching the encoder to the screw, I believe we can improve accuracy. However, I am unsure of the best model for this unique mounting challenge. While I am accustomed to using encoders for tracking linear materials, I find that using a wheel-mounted encoder may not provide the stability and accuracy needed in this scenario. I understand this is a challenging question to pose, but I welcome any suggestions or insights you may have on this matter. Do you have any thoughts or recommendations?</p>

            <p>When dealing with a V-belt drive prone to slippage, attaching the encoder to the screw shaft can provide a more precise measurement and consistent positioning. Are you considering mounting another timing belt pulley on the screw shaft to operate the encoder, or utilizing a coupling to connect to an in-line encoder? It appears to be an acme threaded screw rather than a ball screw. Therefore, it is important to consider backlash when changing direction. To achieve the most precise positioning, approach your target position from the same direction consistently to reduce the effects of backlash.</p>

            <p>What level of precision is the customer aiming for? The six spokes appear to equal a sixth of a rotation, roughly 0.1 inches linearly. How much play is there in the system? Is there a significant amount of back-and-forth movement, or is it mainly forward and backward at different rates? Would proximity sensors or laser distance measurement be a more straightforward solution for this application?</p>

            <p>Steve: When I was writing, I couldn't remember the term "ACME," but yes, it is a long ACME screw. As for using a coupling to an in-line encoder, I did a Google search and it seems like a good option. I just need to figure out how to mount it on the end since there is no shaft beyond the pulley. The concept of "backlash" is now on my radar, thanks to posting questions here. I will explore how it affects the position over time.

DrBitboy: The operator uses a joystick manually to add layers of rubber to a shaft, with some back-and-forth movement involved. The building process is not highly precise, as the rubber is layered, baked, and shaped by another machine. The speed is not very fast. Laser positioning was suggested, but I am unsure if it is suitable for this environment due to the potential risk of breaking the beam accidentally. There is a process of building in one direction, followed by some back-and-forth movement. I plan to record the operator's actions and encoder points using the joystick terminals, then make adjustments to perfect the cycle on an HMI. In theory, this should streamline the process.</p>

            <p>Backlash in mechanical systems refers to the space between the screw threads and the nut threads. This phenomenon is often observed as a buildup of encoder counts without actual movement, especially when changing direction. Backlash can also be noticeable during deceleration, especially at high speeds and low friction levels.</p>

            <p>What does the end of the screw shaft resemble? Consider utilizing a positive drive belt for attaching a motor-mounted encoder. However, this modification may require additional measures to prevent overtravel, as the current system relies on belt slippage for mechanical relief which would be eliminated with a SilentSync belt drive.</p>

            <p>Are you planning to cover the pulley and belt to protect them from debris? It appears that there is a gap between the pillow-block bearing and the pulley once the grease is wiped away. This could be a good spot to install a split-collar gear to connect to an encoder shaft or a timing belt for the same purpose. While a helical gear on a vertical shaft could work with the Acme thread, it may be challenging to select the right gear for proper engagement as a "worm".

Considering the direction of the motor or joystick controlling the shaft, using a single-channel pulse generator instead of a two-channel quadrature encoder might be feasible. Electro-Sensors offers durable magnet rings that can be easily installed to feed a high-speed proximity switch, providing reliable feedback.</p>

Ken praised an illustration and suggested using a single-channel pulse generator instead of a two-channel quadrature encoder for direction inference. They discussed potential challenges related to helical gears and finding the right components.

Paul mentioned the importance of using components he already owns to minimize costs for the customer. He plans to test the position tracking theory before investing in expensive equipment like a laser distance measuring device.</p>

            <p>Stop overthinking it! Simply install a hollow-shaft encoder with a leaf antirotation mount between the pulley and pillow block bearing. All you'll need is a tapped hole for a shoulder bolt. Check out EPC for Incremental, Slim Profile Thru Bore Encoders for large shafts. Before mounting, clean the shaft and measure the diameter with a micrometer. Can you estimate the screw's RPM accurately?

            <p>@Ken Roach's idea seems like a winner to me. However, I still believe that integrating spokes on the pulley with a photoeye system could be a game-changer. This custom solution may be a bit more challenging to maintain, but definitely worth considering. By strategically placing two photoeyes at specific points on the pulley, you can obtain directional information through quadrature, eliminating the need to constantly query the motors and avoiding the loss of direction data while the system is in motion. It's also important to note that backlash can be effectively accounted for in any system being used. Additionally, I would like to know the maximum speed (screw RPM) achievable when utilizing either the small reversing motor or the motor/clutch located on the opposite end.</p>

            <p>Ken seems to have found the perfect solution! I decided to search on Google to get an estimate of the price, and came across a used one on Ebay priced at around $150, with a 30-day return policy. I plan to purchase this and test it out, possibly adding it to my growing testing lab. If it proves effective for this specific use, I will purchase a new one for the customer. The part number is 776-B-S-1024-D-HV-J-X-A-N-N, featuring Channel B leading A, reverse quadrature A & B with index, and a 40mm bore size. The output is "Line Driver". I will research more about quadrature tomorrow, and I already have their tech support number saved in my phone from previous calls. Although the RPM is not high, I will need to determine the exact number using a Tachometer during my next visit. I will also utilize a micrometer to measure the screw.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach inquired about the logic controller or motion controller being considered for use. He mentioned the need to inspect the signal wires on the joystick, particularly focusing on the voltage. With the wires being red and dealing with an older machine, it is assumed that managing 120vac inputs and outputs (or relay outs) along with dc voltage inputs for the encoder (high speed inputs) will be necessary. Setting aside the older components, there are multiple small 24vdc controllers available including CompactLogix L16ER, Automation Direct BRX (paired with an 8" Cmore HMI), AB Micro 820, and S7-1200. Assessing the requirements for encoder programming is essential, especially in dealing with two directions. If none of the existing options prove suitable, a new controller may be purchased with customer approval. Feedback on a suitable controller choice is welcome and appreciated.</p>

            <p>I apologize if I overlooked this, but it is crucial to have a "home" sensor for your system. I suggest utilizing a proximity sensor's falling edge to calibrate the system; this allows for manual resetting by moving the unit to the home position. Alternatively, you can incorporate an automated homing sequence. Consider implementing end of travel limits as well. While time of flight lasers are too slow for many applications, draw wire encoders have proven to be highly effective for positioning carriages in a discreet location.</p>

            <p>I believe the S7 model features HSC inputs, allowing for the use of two phase encoders to easily detect direction without extensive programming. This capability can streamline processes and improve efficiency.</p>
