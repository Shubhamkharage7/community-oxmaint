                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello to all those willing to offer a helping hand! I have a project where I need to incorporate Solidworks animations or "3D" models of machine assemblies into an AB Panelview Plus 700. The ultimate objective is to provide troubleshooting guidance for a labeling machine that frequently experiences faults from sensors and other issues. The customer has a high turnover rate and is seeking a user-friendly way for operators to easily identify and resolve any faults that may occur. Currently, the HMI for the machine includes an alarm banner on the main display that appears when a fault arises, listing the names of active faults only. Additionally, there is a "Fault Screen" with navigation buttons for all machine faults in a table format. When a fault is active, an indicator appears next to it, and the operator can press the navigation button to access the specific fault's screen, which includes a description of the issue, how to resolve it, and a visual representation of the fault location or device. Similar to how the office printer has 3D animations for clearing paper jams, it would be beneficial for Rockwell to have a similar feature. Although the concept is straightforward, I am new to this and would greatly appreciate any helpful suggestions or tips from others who have experience in this area. Thank you for any assistance offered.</p>

            <p>I have experience working with various HMI interfaces, utilizing static images controlled through display settings. The graphic artist responsible for 3D rendering would create screen shots in different colors to represent various states, including green for running, light grey for off, and red/yellow for alarm/fault. This method required managing multiple static images to control the display effectively.</p>

            <p>I have successfully used video tutorials on PVs for maintenance and troubleshooting in the past. If you are able to convert SolidWorks files into a PV-compatible format, it could work. However, PV does not support native SolidWorks file formats. Based on my personal experience, it may not be worth the effort. Operators tend to rely on trial and error for troubleshooting and are unlikely to spend time reading or viewing SolidWorks diagrams. We stopped creating videos and online manuals as they were not being utilized.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, Jeff. I truly appreciate it. I was hoping to avoid going down that route, if possible. The labeling machines I design are versatile and cater to various product and label combinations, each requiring a unique design based on their physical characteristics. This means that different machines are needed for different products seen in a typical grocery store. If I want to incorporate this feature in future designs, I won't be able to reuse static images from one machine to the next. I am exploring options such as a potential SolidWorks ActiveX widget or a hidden FactoryTalk feature known only to industry experts.</p>

            <p>In a discussion, robertmee mentioned experimenting with using video guides on PVs for maintenance and troubleshooting, specifically mentioning the challenges of incorporating Solid Works file formats. However, based on personal experience, it was found to be ineffective as operators tend to rely on trial and error rather than consulting diagrams or guides. The decision to discontinue videos and online manuals was made due to low usage. It seems that others echo the sentiment that investing time in these methods may not be worthwhile.

I fully empathize with the frustration of having to create videos for each assembly and its variations. Despite the potential benefits, the skepticism remains about the effectiveness of such initiatives. It is understood why the decision was made to halt these efforts, even though the pressure to implement them persists.</p>

            <p>Robertmee commended the remarkable ignition work done by a talented individual, particularly impressed by the oil and gas examples presented. However, it is worth noting that the app shared could quickly become outdated within a year. Many businesses still rely on asset lists that are decades old on paper, creating challenges when implementing new projects. Despite the allure of 3D illustrations, the reality is that the actual startup process often diverges significantly from the initial models. While these apps may serve as valuable tools for managerial and sales presentations, their practical utility in driving production efficiency is questionable. The issue of maintaining current data also poses a significant challenge. It can be frustrating to be tasked with using outdated technology, especially when decision-makers seem oblivious to the concerns raised by those lower down the hierarchy. It is surprising that a reputable company like Rockwell does not offer a standard solution for viewing and manipulating 3D models.</p>
