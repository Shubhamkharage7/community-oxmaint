                    <p>I have a confession to make - I have never had to replace a battery in a SLC system before. Somehow, I have managed to avoid this task throughout my years of experience. However, yesterday when the need to replace the battery arose, I discovered that it is located on the card and must be removed in order to change it (which seems somewhat inconvenient). My concern is whether removing the battery in an unpowered state will result in the loss of the program, as I would anticipate. Can anyone confirm if this is the case?</p>

            <p>It is possible for the capacitors in devices to lose their strength over time, although they are designed to last long enough for battery replacement. To avoid any issues, it is a good idea to connect and perform an online save before shutting down the device. In case of any malfunctions, there is a reset procedure that involves removing the battery and shorting two points on the board to drain the capacitors and reset the device to its default settings. It is recommended to hold the points shorted for at least 1 to 5 minutes.</p>

            <p>To ensure you don't lose your program and data when swapping the battery, you should always assume the capacitor may not hold the charge. Upload a fresh backup before replacing the battery to avoid any potential issues. Even though I once had a unit sit unpowered for a week and retain the program, it's best not to rely on luck. I've personally made it a habit to create a new backup before any battery swaps to prevent any unexpected data loss. Following this practice has helped me avoid any mishaps due to Murphy's Law.</p>

            <p>I must confess, I have never had to replace a SLC505 battery before and was surprised to learn that it requires removing the card. I recently requested an I&C tech to do it, but now understand why it hasn't been done yet. Knowing this will be valuable for future reference. It's unfortunate that such a critical task for process equipment cannot be performed without shutdown.</p>

            <p>Due to space limitations, the models 5/01 and 5/02 feature the battery located at the front. However, in the 5/03 model and onwards, the presence of two communication ports posed a challenge as it limited the accessibility of the battery space.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the main concern was the limitation of space. The models were lacking sufficient real estate after integrating a serial port. In my experience, the capacitor can retain a charge for multiple days, contrary to the worst-case scenario of 30 minutes advised. While I haven't encountered any capacitor failures, it's important to be cautious when uploading a new program. One of the benefits of the capacitor is that it preserves the program even when the battery is drained, ensuring continuity after brief power interruptions.</p>

            <p>It is possible for the program to be lost if the internal power supply, which charges the battery and capacitor, is malfunctioning. This has occurred to me three times in the last 5 years. It is important to have spares on hand and send them in for repair. As a precaution, always go online with the PLC to upload and save the program on the PC first. If a spare is not available, replace the battery, power up the CPU, and check if the program is lost - if so, it can be retrieved from the PC. If the program is lost, download it, switch the PLC to run mode, power off the unit for 2-3 minutes, and then power it back on to see if the program is lost again. This will guide you on your next steps. Regards, James.</p>
