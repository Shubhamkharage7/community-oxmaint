            <p>Welcome to our forum! When connecting an RS-232 to the Channel 0 9-pin serial port of the SLC-5/04 controller, make sure to use the "RS-232 DF1 Devices" driver. Double-check that you have selected the correct COM port for your USB/RS232 interface and that you are using the appropriate serial cable, such as the 1747-CP3. Null-modem type serial cables are also compatible. Keep in mind that serial cables for connecting to a PanelView's serial port must be straight-through, not null-modem. Some USB/RS232 interfaces may not support the "Autoconfigure" feature, so utilize the default settings in the RS232 DF1 Devices driver. In rare cases, an unused Channel 0 port may be configured differently, requiring assistance from someone with a proper DH+ interface for uploading.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt response, Ken. I have ensured that the correct COM port is selected. The cable I am using was previously utilized to connect to a MicroLogix 1100, but I am unsure if it is a null modem type serial cable. I have also attempted to connect using the default RS232 DF1 settings. Is there a way to verify the protocol configuration for channel 0? I am essentially starting with limited information on how this PLC was set up before, but I want to eliminate any potential issues before seeking outside assistance.</p>

            <p>Confusion may arise when dealing with the various types of plugs on the SLC-5/04. The three-pin "Phoenix" style plug and the 8-pin round Mini-DIN plug are both linked to the Data Highway Plus port, known as Channel 1. The 9-pin D-Sub connector serves as the Channel 0 serial port. It may be puzzling that A-B utilizes 8-pin Mini-DIN connectors for different ports, but in the world of electronics, this is common. Cisco, for example, uses RJ45 for both serial and network ports on a single switch. A-B has designed their connectors to prevent incorrect plugging into devices, but third-party cables may lack this feature. If a 1747-CP3 cable is not available, a regular straight-through serial cable with a null-modem adapter can be used. These cables were once readily available at Radio Shack stores.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the information provided! I attempted to connect using an RS232 DF1 device driver type with a straight-through serial cable and null-modem adapter, but unfortunately, it did not work. I do, however, have an 8 pin DIN connector to USB cable. Since the plug on the SLC 5/04 connects to channel 1, would it be possible to establish a "proper DH+ interface" as recommended in your initial response?</p>

            <p>If you are looking to connect to a DH+ port from USB, the only compatible option is the 1784-U2DHP. If you are unsure about the USB to Mini-DIN8 device you have, especially if it does not have a Rockwell Automation distributor's part number on it, it would be best to seek clarification from the seller. In most cases, the Channel 0 port is typically set to DF1 Full Duplex, requiring only default driver settings. However, there may be exceptions where additional configurations are needed.</p>

            <p>We appreciate your clarification regarding the 1761-CBL-PM02 cable. This cable is designed to connect to the RS-232 serial port of a MicroLogix controller. Plugging it into the SLC-5/04's DH+ network port may not have caused any damage, but it is surprising that it fit. It is important to note that the default settings for an SLC-5/04 (and all SLC and MicroLogix serial ports) are as follows:</p>

            <p>Recent update: After conducting further research, I discovered a potential offline version of the program on the SLC. It appears that Channel 0 is configured to use the DF1 Full Duplex protocol, indicating that I should be able to establish a connection. Additionally, I observed that the baud rate in the file is set to 1200. Despite configuring a driver with the same rate and adjusting the COM port settings on my computer accordingly, I have not been successful in establishing a connection. The troubleshooting process is ongoing.</p>

This realization came to me when I conducted a continuity test on the pins. It's a facepalm moment for not verifying this sooner, but it's a lesson learned. I want to express my gratitude to Ken for his invaluable assistance; I gained a wealth of knowledge about ports and cables through this experience. It's clear that this forum is an invaluable resource for information and support.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I am attempting to establish communication with a Slc 5/04 programmable logic controller (PLC) utilizing the 1747-cp3 cable and RS232-DF1 driver on my laptop. Despite trying three different serial to USB converters, I was unsuccessful in configuring the driver. I then attempted connecting the 1747-CP3 cable directly to a docking station, bypassing the converter, but still encountered issues with configuring the driver. I am in need of assistance as I am unsure of where I am going wrong. Thank you in advance for any help provided!</p>

            <p>JesperMP raised a query about the serial port assignment of the docking station as COM1. To confirm this, one can refer to the Windows Device Manager. It is important to have a backup copy of the PLC program, as it can streamline troubleshooting by checking the CH0 port setting in the offline program. I always verify the COM port setting as COM1 whenever I connect the docking station. With a backup program in place, I will ensure that the COM port is correctly configured.

            <p>Hello, I have been attempting to establish a connection to a SLC 5/04 PLC using a null modem cable through RS232 DF1 device driver. I have a backup of the current program and channel 0 is properly configured for DF1 Full Duplex. I have tried using two different computers, one running Windows XP SP2 and the other running Windows 7, both equipped with physical COM ports. Despite trying both auto configure and manual settings for two days, I was unable to successfully connect. Just when I was about to give up, after repeatedly clicking the auto configure button, the connection suddenly became successful. I was able to go online, upload, and download. I then tried the second computer with Windows 7 and the connection was successful on the first attempt, allowing me to perform the same operations. However, the next day I encountered the same connection issue and am now unable to connect with either computer, despite no changes being made. I have tried clicking the auto configure button multiple times, but to no avail. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thabel mentioned the challenges faced while establishing a connection to SLC 5/04 using a null modem cable through RS232 DF1 device driver. Despite having the correct configuration for DF1 Full Duplex on channel 0, attempts on two different computers with physical com ports running Windows XP SP2 and Windows 7 were initially unsuccessful. After continuous effort and clicking on the auto configure button, the connection suddenly became successful, enabling online operations, upload, and download. Subsequently, the connection was successful on the first try on the second computer as well.

However, on the following day, the connection issue resurfaced without any changes made. Multiple attempts to auto configure the connection were futile. To troubleshoot the intermittent comm port issue, consider reinstalling the comm port and RSlinx to eliminate any conflicting configurations. It is important to verify that the comm port is not in use and monitor it with a loopback to identify any background processes attempting to access it. Additionally, ensure that the comm port driver is functioning correctly in Windows and consider reinstalling it if necessary. This intermittent issue could be related to another software attempting to use the comm port periodically, necessitating persistent efforts to establish a stable connection. Your insights and suggestions on resolving this issue are highly valued. Thank you.</p>

            <p>arpus4KM suggests that if a comm port is experiencing intermittent issues, it may be due to another program attempting to access it. By reinstalling the comm port and RSlinx, any unusual configurations that are causing the port to be accessed can be cleared. For example, RSlinx had a background process continuously attempting to open comm ports 1-7, leading to issues. It is important to check if the comm port is currently in use, monitor it for data transmission, ensure the driver is functioning properly, and consider other software that may be intermittently using it. In a similar situation, swapping out the SLC 5/04 unit resolved the problem, indicating a possible defect with the RS232 port.</p>
