                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, I am employed at a power generation facility and we are facing an issue related to the oil in a primary transformer. The transformer in question operates at 18/161kV and has a capacity of 400kVA. Approximately two months ago, the transformer's oil underwent purification and was put back into operation. Recently, we have observed a rise in hydrogen levels in the oil, reaching around 200 ppm, with a continuous increase. Additionally, there has been a noticeable uptick in CO and CO2 concentrations. Notably, there has been no rise in other combustible gas levels. According to findings from a chemical analysis, this phenomenon is known as "stray gassing," where hydrogen is released from the oil during heating. I have a few inquiries: 1. How long will the elevated hydrogen levels persist before stabilizing? 2. Will lowering the oil temperature result in reduced hydrogen levels, and if so, where does the released hydrogen go? The transformer is hermetically sealed. 3. I have come across information about using an "inhibitor" oil additive to mitigate the stray gassing issue. Can anyone provide details on this? Is it a recommended solution, and what specific compound is suggested? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Good morning Vyacheslav, I recommend investigating the cause of gas generation in the transformer. I understand that this may be a challenging task due to the complexities of examining the internal components. It is essential to identify the root cause in order to effectively address the issue. In the meantime, it might be necessary to temporize until the transformer can be taken offline for a thorough inspection. If you require assistance, I can connect you with a knowledgeable industry expert in transformer oil analysis. Please feel free to contact me at johan.vanrensburg@ammeglobal.com. Best regards, Johan.</p>

            <p>Hello Johan, I appreciate your assistance. I need to rectify an error in my previous message - the correct power rating for the transformer is 400MVA, not 400kVA as previously stated.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  How long will the elevated hydrogen levels persist before stabilizing?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The duration for hydrogen levels to stabilize can vary depending on factors such as the transformer's operating conditions, oil temperature, and the presence of any underlying issues. Continuous monitoring and analysis are recommended to track the stabilization process.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Will lowering the oil temperature result in reduced hydrogen levels, and where does the released hydrogen go in a hermetically sealed transformer?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Lowering the oil temperature can potentially reduce hydrogen levels as it may slow down the release of hydrogen from the oil. The released hydrogen typically remains within the sealed transformer system.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  What is an "inhibitor" oil additive, and how does it help mitigate stray gassing in transformers?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: An inhibitor oil additive is a compound introduced into the transformer oil to help reduce the release of hydrogen during heating, hence mitigating stray gassing. The specific compound and its effectiveness may vary, and consulting with experts or manufacturers for recommended solutions is advisable.</p>
