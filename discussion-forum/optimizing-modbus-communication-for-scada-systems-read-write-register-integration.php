                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone,
I am currently working on a project that involves integrating the SV (Set Value) of a temperature controller with a SCADA system. The setup involves connecting the SCADA system to a PLC using Modbus TCP, which in turn communicates with the temperature controller via serial/rs485 protocol.

For seamless operation, the SCADA system should be able to both read the current value and modify it as needed. One approach I am considering is exposing a single register for both read and write operations on the PLC. This way, the SCADA system can access the register using Modbus TCP. The ladder logic in the PLC will then verify any changes in the value and, if necessary, write the updated value to the temperature controller.

While researching this setup, I came across some forums that suggest this may not be the best practice. I would greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations on how to effectively address this scenario. Your opinions and suggestions are highly valued. Thank you.</p>

            <p>What type of system is the SCADA (PC, MCU, Arduino, Custom)? What protocols are supported by the SCADA system? Similarly, what type of system is the PLC and what protocols does it support?

When selecting a protocol, I prefer to troubleshoot independently from both ends. For example, if the SCADA system operates as a Modbus Master and the PLC as a Modbus Slave, I would initially set up a simulated Modbus Slave on a Windows or Linux PC. This allows the SCADA system to communicate as a Modbus Master, reading and writing holding registers.

Next, I would configure a Modbus Master on a PC to communicate with the PLC functioning as a Modbus Slave, ensuring that data can be read and written successfully. Using PC-based Modbus applications provides enhanced diagnostics for problem-solving.

Only after successfully running these individual processes would I attempt to connect the SCADA Modbus Master to the PLC Modbus Slave. While some may skip ahead to this step, troubleshooting tools are limited and complex if issues arise.</p>

            <p>I am curious to understand the source of the information that suggests it is not a recommended practice, as I believe it is perfectly suitable when utilizing Modbus. Modbus protocol is specifically designed to allow a single register to be both read and written to, known as Holding Registers. Holding Registers are the most commonly utilized type in Modbus communication. When implementing Modbus, it is advisable to expose a single read/write register for each parameter, such as a Set Value. It is not typical, and could potentially cause confusion among Modbus users, to split the Set Value into separate registers dedicated solely for reading and writing.

It is important to note that there are other protocols (e.g. PROFINET IO, EtherNet/IP, EtherCAT) that facilitate separate input and output data streams requiring segregation into read-only and write-only blocks. However, this distinction is inherent to the nature of the protocol and should not be mistaken for a universal best practice.</p>

            <p>When implementing value comparisons in a PLC system, it is important to ensure error-free communication between the old and new values. By routinely monitoring and verifying data transfer to the controller, potential errors can be quickly identified and remedied. Additionally, it is advisable to set initial values upon system startup to avoid discrepancies. For instance, assigning an unachievable value to the previous value register can signal the PLC to initiate the writing process. These practices help maintain consistency and reliability in the automated system.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Many legacy process controllers have restricted write cycles for certain settings due to limited EEPROM storage capacity. However, it is unlikely that a PID Setpoint would be affected by this limitation. The potential risk of frequent writes to the temperature controller should be considered in such cases.</p>
