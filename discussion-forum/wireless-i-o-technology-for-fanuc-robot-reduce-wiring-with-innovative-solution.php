            <p>Indeed, I have completed this task. While it may not eliminate all components, you will still need to supply power with 24V+ and 0V, along with using compressed air. This option can be costly, which is why I now keep all electrical components and valves clustered on the arm and simply run a series of polyurethane pipes down to the gripper. This setup is relatively simple to achieve and, if a pipe becomes damaged, it is easily repairable without the need for advanced technical skills.</p>

            <p>Although this thread is old, one cost-effective method for achieving this is by using Annex32 on the ESP32. ESPNOW offers fast connectivity, and there is also the option of using Bluetooth. Any ESP32 hardware, such as the popular M5Stack range, can be utilized for this project. Check out the link for the firmware.</p>

            <p>Our utilization of SMC's EX600 wireless modules has been highly effective. As mentioned earlier, it is essential to have +24V, 0V, and compressed air supplied to the tool, but this is a much more efficient alternative compared to using a complete wiring harness or a large collection of air lines. Discover the convenience and benefits of SMC EX600 Wireless Modules for your industrial needs.</p>

            <p>Tinine mentioned that while ESP32s may be more affordable, their cost is still quite high. That being said, the price difference can vary depending on the situation. SMC components have been successfully used in a variety of applications, with the ability to purchase them in bulk for larger projects. These components are easy to integrate across different networks, are modular, durable, and compatible with standard industrial sensors like M8 or M12. As for ESP32s, they are an intriguing concept that requires further investigation. One aspect to consider is their environmental ratings, as it wasn't readily available in the information searched. Are these products IP-rated?</p>

            <p>In response to ck8177's comment, it's true that there is a noticeable price difference between the options available. However, the choice between them ultimately depends on the specific circumstances. In our experience, SMC has been a reliable choice for various applications, offering the convenience of purchasing in bulk for larger projects. SMC products are user-friendly, can be easily integrated across different networks, are modular and robust, and are compatible with standard M8 or M12 industrial sensors. 

I am intrigued by the concept of ESP32 and plan to explore it further. One question that comes to mind is whether these products have an IP rating for environmental protection. 

The ESP32 stands out as a versatile microcontroller with numerous peripherals that are increasingly being used in a variety of products. One interesting feature is its compatibility with "waterproof and dustproof" designs. 

Are you familiar with Field Oriented Control and its potential applications when using the ESP32 platform?</p>

            <p>I had a negative experience with an M900i robot used for palletizing, equipped with a Joulin 3-zone vacuum gripper EOAT. The robot would release products unpredictably, prompting me to manually reconfigure all of the I/O connections, which successfully resolved the issue. Looking back, it may not have been the wisest decision on my part to attempt this without proper planning.</p>
