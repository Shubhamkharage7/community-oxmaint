                    <p>In a separate discussion on PMO 2000, Steve Turner expressed his belief that the choice between PF interval and RBI methods, or a combination of both, is crucial. He emphasized the importance of aligning the interval selection methods with the client's preferences. In response to a request for clarification, a new thread on task intervals was initiated. Questions were posed to Steve regarding his approach to determining the P-F interval and the RBI method he mentioned. The discrepancy between client-selected interval methods and existing ones was also addressed. This discussion aims to shed light on these topics and welcomes input from members, particularly Steve Turner, to share their insights and expertise.</p>

            <p>Here are some insights into your inquiries:

1. The availability of published P-F curve data is limited. The application of a P-F curve is more of a theoretical concept rather than a definitive rule due to the numerous factors and variables involved in equipment reliability. However, the P-F curve for bearings is relatively well-understood, particularly in relation to vibration analysis technology. In cases of imminent component failures, mechanics may resort to strategies such as greasing bearing cavities to extend their lifespan until a replacement can be made. This process often involves making educated guesses or rough estimates on the remaining lifespan of the component.

2. Upon conducting a search for "Reliability RBI method," results primarily indicated references to Risk Based Inspection methodologies.

3. Many maintenance programs tend to remain stagnant over time. While some equipment owners view their preventive maintenance (PM) programs as infallible, the reality is that these programs are often the result of trial and error during the initial setup phase. It is not uncommon for PM frequencies to evolve as equipment usage patterns and maintenance needs change. By challenging existing techniques and frequencies, organizations can stimulate discussions and improvements in their maintenance practices. Ultimately, PM calendar frequencies are mere estimates, and equipment reliability is primarily influenced by usage rather than adherence to preset maintenance schedules.</p>

            <p>When it comes to determining the P-F interval, my approach focuses on consulting industry experts rather than relying solely on hard data. In the aviation sector, there is a wealth of information available on critical crack lengths and crack growth rates, thanks to various structural methods, models, tests, and field data. However, outside of aviation, such detailed data is scarce. 

To estimate the P-F interval, I ask knowledgeable individuals questions like how frequently inspections should be conducted to prevent component failure without prior knowledge. Another important query pertains to the acceptable timeframe for addressing leaks or deteriorating conditions. By gathering insights from experienced professionals who understand equipment deterioration, I aim to establish a rough timeframe for maintenance actions, whether it be in hours, shifts, days, weeks, or months.

It's important to note that the threshold for intervention (F) may differ based on the equipment in question. For instance, in the case of a gearbox, the trigger for maintenance could be when it begins making unusual noises and requires a costly overhaul, rather than waiting until it seizes up. This holistic approach allows me to determine lead times for planning repairs and setting task intervals effectively.</p>

            <p>When implementing the RBI method, the first step is to involve experts who are knowledgeable about the equipment and common failure mechanisms. They assess the likelihood of failure and its potential consequences within a specific timeframe. Inspection methods are determined based on the risks associated with experts' errors and the resulting consequences. Intervals for high consequence failures are set more cautiously compared to low consequence failures.</p>

            <p>Steve, I completely understand your perspective on P-F interval determination, but I differ on RBI methods. According to your statement, "High consequence means the intervals are set more conservatively than low consequence failures." In line with API 580/581 guidelines, the risk level is determined by Probability x Consequence AND a Confidence Rating, rather than Consequence alone. This approach is reminiscent of FMECA methodology. Contrastingly, RCM takes a different approach, considering both Consequence and the visibility of failure. Some argue that survival probability is crucial and strive to gather supporting data, whether quantitatively or qualitatively. While a separate 'Confidence Rating' is not explicitly specified or utilized, all analytical methods involve specialists who understand the equipment and failure mechanisms. I am particularly interested in the specific RBI methods you suggested for PMO 2000. Could you provide a few steps to exemplify your point?</p>

            <p>In the realm of risk assessment, the combination of Probability and Consequence, along with a Confidence Rating, play a crucial role in determining the overall risk level according to API 580/581 guidelines. This approach closely mirrors that of FMECA methodology. The importance of considering all three factors, rather than just Consequence alone, cannot be overstated. I concur with your perspective on this, Vee.</p>

            <p>I requested a new thread on this topic because we follow decision logic standards when establishing failure modes using RCM or PMO2000 methods. Despite how the failure modes are determined, my maintenance program remains consistent. While we do not cover RBI in our courses, I personally view it as a subset of RCM, although not everyone shares this perspective. RBI is a method used to determine inspection intervals for condition-based inspections. I agree with the approach you presented, and I am open to learning more about it from qualified individuals. I am not a certified RBI engineer, but the PMO2000 process manages it effectively. For specialized cases like the example with fin fans using aluminum blades susceptible to cracking, I would involve structural engineers for evaluating crack detection methods. In situations involving corrosion in pressure vessels, I rely on expert advice and only provide input if necessary. If you're looking to delve into the details of RBI, you may not find extensive input from me. If you are an expert in RBI and certified, I commend you, as I am not.</p>

            <p>Hello, Steve. I am a bit confused by your response. You mentioned using RBI methods, so I asked for clarification on which ones were utilized with PMO 2000. However, you now mention that you are not a certified RBI engineer. You also mention that you believe RBI is a subset of RCM, despite me explaining the difference in a previous discussion. I am curious about the basis of this belief. If you do not implement RBI methods, that's fine, we can move on from this topic. But if you do, could you specify which aspects of RBI you incorporate? I don't think it's an unreasonable request. You mentioned agreeing with me; I'm interested in understanding exactly what aspect you agree with. Please clarify this for me. I hope you don't feel like I'm trying to trap you. I simply want to comprehend your statements better as I continue to explore and learn.</p>

            <p>In a previous conversation, Steve mentioned that "The inspection methods are designed to mitigate the risks associated with experts making incorrect assessments." Our analysis aims to prompt experts to outline their projected findings and timelines. Our inspections are tailored to occur at intervals representing a percentage of the anticipated remaining lifespan, typically between 20% and 40%, in order to predict potential failures. While unexpected issues may arise, the primary focus of our inspections is not based on anticipating expert oversight.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It looks like my original comment may have been misunderstood. I never said that we evaluate risks because we anticipate experts being incorrect. In fact, our analysis is geared towards understanding what experts anticipate finding and when. During our inspections, which are typically timed at a certain percentage of the expected remaining life, we aim to ascertain the likelihood of expected failures. While unexpected issues may be uncovered during inspections, the main focus is not on proving experts wrong. Rather, it is about validating their predictions, which can sometimes be inaccurate. We trust that experts will make accurate assessments, but there is always a risk of errors. Our goal is to minimize these risks and ensure accurate evaluations.</p>

            <p>In response to Steve's statement, I must clarify that my comments have been misunderstood. I did not twist or turn around any statements as accused. My concern lies in the belief that inspection methods are rooted in experts predicting what they expect to find and when, rather than evaluating risks of experts being wrong. It is important to understand that the accuracy of inspections depends on experts being right, not wrong. This distinction is crucial in understanding the basis of inspection methods.</p>

            <p>When the client takes control of the interval selection process, excluding the rejected options, it begs the question: why would there be a deviation from the current intervals? This raises the larger issue of why a PMO analysis is necessary if the client still dictates the task intervals, which may not vary significantly from the current ones. What benefits would conducting a PMO2000 analysis bring in this scenario?</p>

            <p>Josh, that's a great question that deserves some attention. In my experience, many maintenance programs are often developed in isolation, following traditional practices. This approach is generally inefficient, as our data reveals that around 40% of these programs do not stand up to a thorough review. Approximately 15% of the information is missing, 30% is excessive, and 15% is deemed unnecessary.

I may have given the wrong impression by mentioning that we ask clients for their interval logic process. In reality, we typically utilize the RCM decision logic, unless the client has their own preferred method. Out of the numerous sites we've worked with, only twice have we deviated from what we consider the RCM approach outlined in SAE JA 1011. While we are open to utilizing the client's method, it's often the case that they do not have a structured framework in place, leading us to implement our own or improve upon an existing one.

In addition to our focus on client needs, we offer a range of intangible benefits, including professional facilitation, project management, technical writing, conflict resolution, structured workshops, and comprehensive training. Therefore, Josh, while it may seem like we are not making a significant impact on the surface, it is rare that we do not add value to the maintenance programs we work on.</p>

            <p>Steve, in a previous post on a different thread, you mentioned utilizing task selection methods outlined in JA 1011. It is important to consider both the definition of tasks and their frequency for a comprehensive approach. When it comes to task intervals specifically, JA 1011 provides guidance on determining the criteria to follow. This involves assessing the likelihood of failure, which I believe your PMO 2000 analysts did in the Ollie Fin Fan incident. Can you elaborate on how they assessed survival probabilities when adjusting intervals by a factor of 2 or more for failure modes?</p>
