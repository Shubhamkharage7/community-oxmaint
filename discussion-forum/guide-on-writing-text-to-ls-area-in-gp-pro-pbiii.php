                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I trust you are all doing well. I am currently in the process of updating an HMI project for the GP2500 and have come across a challenge that I could use some help with. The project involves using D-Script to move text from various LS0300+ areas to LS1005, where it is displayed on the screen when the corresponding button is pressed. Upon further investigation, I have discovered text files within the project, with my belief being that text is extracted from file X21 for the English language. The designated area in the backup settings of the GP settings is the starting address LS0300, with a size of 110. However, I am having difficulty understanding the process of transferring text from X21 to LS0300. My objective is to input my text into LS0313, which is currently vacant. If anyone could offer guidance or assistance in clarifying this for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you all in advance for your support.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I recently discovered a hidden W Tag Setting on the same screen, which proved to be the solution to my issue. By triggering LS203805, I was able to write Constant 217 to LS0313, which represents the empty row in the X21 file. This has resolved my problem. However, I was unable to locate a look-up or cross-referencing tool in GP Pro/PBlll. Is such a tool available?</p>
