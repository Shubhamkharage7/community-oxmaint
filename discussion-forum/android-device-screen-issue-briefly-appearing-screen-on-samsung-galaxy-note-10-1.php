                    <p>When accessing my Android device, specifically a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, I've noticed a screen that briefly appears for 3-5 seconds upon opening the site and when navigating through forums. This issue has only started occurring in the past week, adding to the list of concerns for optimizing Android functionality. I have also observed other deficiencies in the past.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Several issues were reported early on after the transition to the new board format, around late August or September. While we were informed that changes were expected in October, it appears that this particular issue has not been addressed. Are any changes currently being implemented? Is there any progress being made in resolving the concerns raised by users? The use of an Android device can be particularly challenging. On multiple occasions, it was observed that clicking on the "Reply" button did not yield any response. However, it was later discovered that clicking slightly above the Reply button, around 1/4 to 1/2 inch, allowed the action to proceed. This suggests that there may be inaccuracies in the positioning of various fields, particularly on Android devices.</p>
