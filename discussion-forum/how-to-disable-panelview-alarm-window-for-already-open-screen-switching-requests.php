                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Is there a method to prevent the alarm window from appearing on PanelViews when an operator mistakenly attempts to switch to the current screen? I am in the process of optimizing a turkey system and the manufacturer utilized the same navigation bar on every panel. While not a significant issue, this occurrence is quite frequent and can be bothersome. Creating unique navigation for each display is an option, but it would be more convenient if this feature could be deactivated. Thank you, -Brad</p>

            <p>I agree with Okie that under Global Connections, there is a Display Tab where you can associate a connection tag to indicate which display is currently active. In order to do this, each screen must have a unique identification number assigned. This can be done by right-clicking on each display and accessing the Display Settings. Once a display ID is assigned, you can use the visibility animation property for each button. A simple expression like "If DisplayIdTag == 10 then 0 else 1" can be used to hide the display identified as 10 when true. To ensure a seamless user experience, consider creating a panel that matches the size and color of each button and placing it underneath. This way, when a button disappears, the operator will still see a visually consistent layout. It's worth noting that the screen in question is not an alarm screen but rather a Diagnostic Screen, which allows you to customize the displayed information. However, it's uncertain if there is a feature to restrict access to certain settings.</p>

            <p>To disable the Diagnostic Screen on your software, navigate to the System Folder and locate the Diagnostic List Setup option. The help file provides a helpful tip: "If you prefer the Diagnostic List not to open automatically, simply uncheck all boxes." The decision is yours to make. For more detailed information, access the Diagnostic List Setup and click on the Help Button on the property page for a comprehensive explanation. This step can be crucial for enhancing the performance of your software.</p>

            <p>cwal61 and Okie both agree that under Global Connections, there is a Display Tab where you can add a connection tag to specify which display is currently open. Each screen must have a unique identification number, which can be set by right-clicking on the display and going to Display Settings. Once a display ID is assigned, use the visibility property of the animation for each button. An expression like "If DisplayIdTag == 10 then 0 else 1" can be used to hide a specific display, such as display 10. Another tip is to create a panel the same size and color as each button and place it underneath, so that if a button disappears, the operator will still see a blank button.

It is important to note that the screen being discussed is not an alarm screen but a Diagnostic Screen. While it does have properties that allow you to choose what it displays, it may not have the ability to lock out certain situations.

Overall, it is preferred that buttons do not disappear, as it can create confusion for users trying to navigate the screen. It is more user-friendly to load a new screen without already having a button pressed.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the advice. I located the settings in "Diagnostics List Setup" for automatically opening the display when a warning occurs. I noticed that the warning was checked, so I will be unchecking that to see if it helps. Adjusting the visibility of buttons is a good alternative option.</p>

            <p>If a window pops up displaying a yellow triangle, it is a warning message. Disabling warnings as described above can prevent the window from appearing. If the message contains a red circle with a white "x," it indicates an error. It's not recommended to turn off error messages. Although I can't remember which type of message will appear, I hope it's a warning.</p>

            <p>In agreement with Okie, within the Global Connections section, there is a Display Tab where you can assign a connection tag to indicate which display is currently active. To accomplish this, each screen must have a unique ID number. By right-clicking on each display and accessing Display Settings, you can assign a display ID and utilize the visibility animation property for each button. A simple expression, like "If DisplayIdTag == 10 then 0 else 1," can be used to hide the display identified as 10 when the condition is true. To ensure a seamless transition, consider creating panels of the same size and color as the buttons and placing them beneath the buttons so that when a button disappears, the operator sees a blank placeholder. It seems that the screen in question may not be an alarm screen but rather the Diagnostic Screen, which allows you to choose its display content but may not offer the ability to lock out specific situations. 

After implementing these steps, you may notice a delay when the display opens before the button disappears and reveals the dummy button. This delay may not meet quality standards and could lead to the removal of the Go To Display buttons per screen. To address this issue, you may consider shifting the logic processing to the PLC for faster execution. This approach may be preferable to additional effort in configuring Visibility expressions. Do you have any recommendations or insights on this matter?</p>

            <p>Before proceeding, verify that you have configured the tag's property to "Default" to avoid any potential issues. This is particularly crucial when using a device tag, as it simplifies the process for the PV. If your device tag is a DINT, be sure to adjust the settings accordingly. Consider changing the "Display Tag" to a Memory Tag instead of a Device Tag, unless it is being utilized in the PLC. This minor adjustment may streamline the tagging process and improve overall performance.</p>

            <p>Looking for a creative solution? Consider adding an inset panel with text overlay directly onto your navigation button for a sleek look. By matching the size, color, border width, and font of the button, you can create a recessed effect rather than a raised one. This visual element is purely for aesthetics and does not affect the button's functionality. It simply adds an interesting design element to your display without any added actions.</p>

            <p>cwal61 suggested checking that the tag's property is set to "Default" to prevent potential issues, especially when using a device tag. This can help improve performance by ensuring the PV doesn't have to calculate it. If your device tag is a DINT, be sure to configure it accordingly. Consider using a Memory Tag instead of a Device Tag for the "Display Tag" unless it is being used in the PLC. 

I realized that I only had the PLC tag in Global Connections and had not added it to the HMI Tags. While researching best practices on Rockwell's Knowledgebase, I learned that using PLC tags may be faster. However, I typically prefer keeping tags in the PLC. I began to wonder if having excessive logic in the animation was causing slowdowns and if I should have utilized the PLC for that as well.</p>
