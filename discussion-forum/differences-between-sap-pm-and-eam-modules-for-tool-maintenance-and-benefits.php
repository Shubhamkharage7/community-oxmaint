                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone,

I am embarking on a project related to SAP and looking to streamline our tool management process by implementing various maintenance schedules (e.g. annual maintenance for a specific group). As a beginner in SAP, I am seeking guidance on where to begin this project. Currently, we handle tool management in SAP MM, but maintenance tasks are not integrated within the system.

1. Can you explain the differences between PM and EAM? I understand that a tool is considered an asset, so I believe EAM might be more suitable. However, I have come across information suggesting that PM has evolved into EAM.

2. Would PM be the appropriate module for implementing preventive or condition-based maintenance for tools?

3. What are the key advantages of using PM? In simpler terms, what specific functions does PM offer?

4. Is it possible to manage tool reservations with PM? I am unsure, but it would be beneficial for operators to plan tool requirements in advance. Which module would cater to this feature?

Thank you in advance for your assistance!</p>

            <p>Preventive Maintenance (PM) versus Enterprise Asset Management (EAM): While PM focuses on Time-Based maintenance, EAM encompasses a broader range of maintenance activities. For detailed definitions of PM and EAM, explore discussions on "Improving Reliability" boards or refer to reputable magazines like Uptime and Plant Services, as well as useful handbooks. When it comes to tools in maintenance, it's essential to clarify that we're referring to equipment management rather than physical tools like screwdrivers or hammers.

If you're looking to manage maintenance tasks, create schedules, and handle corrective maintenance orders, the PM Module is the ideal solution. Dive into existing discussions on various platforms for more insights and information. While SAP R/3 offers the option to reserve tools, it may not always be the best fit for every project implementation. In SAP R/3, a tool remains allocated to an order until it is completed, limiting its availability for other assignments. It's crucial to assess tool availability and usage to ensure efficient maintenance operations within SAP R/3.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. This discussion board is filled with knowledgeable individuals! In regards to the various points mentioned:

1. I will check it out when I have some free time. If anyone has a link, please feel free to share it here. 
2. Yes, I am referring to equipment, such as a test system used to ensure the functionality of our products.
3. Same as Question No. 1
4. It seems that once equipment is ordered by someone, it cannot be booked by anyone else, which doesn't meet our needs. I envision a system where equipment can be booked and reserved even if it is being used by someone else or scheduled for maintenance between the time of booking and when it is needed. Can you confirm if this is indeed not possible?
5. After researching the SAP online help, I am uncertain about which module manages equipment. We occasionally use equipment for various projects and store them in our equipment warehouse, managed by MM. So if we declare the equipment in SAP as pieces of equipment, we can include maintenance tasks and schedule PM orders. Will we continue to track them in MM, or will we switch to PM moving forward?</p>

            <p>Is your company involved in the manufacturing of electrical and electronic products? Are you referring to PM=SAP Plant Maintenance? Managing 10,000 tools can be quite a task! Are you specifically referring to workshop tools and machines, excluding plant equipment and apparatus? Please provide examples of the tools you use. From what I understand, tools are necessary for maintenance tasks, while plant equipment and apparatus are used for manufacturing processes. In SAP PM, tools are usually managed using Production Resource/Tool (PRT) functionality. All tools need to be registered in SAP PM as master data. For movement, reservation, or booking of these tools in work orders, it is important to itemize operations and specify which tools are needed for each job step. After completing a job step, the user should return the tool to the workshop so it is available for other work orders. This process may also allow for advanced reservation of tools and PRT can check for any scheduling conflicts. It is unclear whether PRT allows for tool borrowing between work orders. If these suggestions do not work, perhaps contacting a SAP PM PRT expert would be beneficial.</p>

            <p>Hi John, you're absolutely right - Plant Maintenance is crucial for our power plant module production, especially for turbines. This entails managing a multitude of tools. Additionally, our focus is on assembly rather than manufacturing, as many parts are outsourced. Therefore, the term "equipment" is more fitting. To properly manage the tools in each work order, it's important to itemize operations and specify which tools are needed for each job step. This ensures efficient tool utilization and availability. Implementing a system for tool return and reservation can allow for advanced booking and prevent scheduling conflicts. As I delve into this, PRT in SAP keeps coming up. I'd appreciate insight on which SAP module manages PRT. I'm also curious about the possibility of borrowing tools between work orders. It seems like a common need for businesses like ours that operate in multiple locations and require ongoing equipment maintenance. Thanks for your help, I'm making great progress with your guidance! :)</p>

            <p>As a manufacturer of turbines, your product consists of the assembled turbines. The components and materials received from suppliers or other plants are managed through the MM and WH modules. In order to handle the turbines during the assembly process, cranes are essential for lifting, moving, and transporting them. These cranes are categorized as equipment, and must be created within the Plant Maintenance module as assets (using transaction IE01). It is important to establish task lists for the maintenance of the cranes, including regular inspections and certifications.

In addition to cranes, other equipment within the Plant Maintenance module may include conveyor belts, forklifts, pallet jacks, pneumatic drills, industrial robots, and other assembly line machines. These equipment may need both preventive and corrective maintenance to ensure optimal performance. Furthermore, utility equipment such as boilers, pumps, air compressors, tanks, fans, motors, weight scales in the warehouse, and instruments requiring calibration are also essential components of your plant's operations.</p>

            <p>Absolutely, Eugene, you're absolutely right! One crucial aspect to consider is how to effectively monitor the locations of equipment requiring either regular maintenance or no maintenance at all. It's essential to have this information readily available when SAP prompts maintenance tasks. Furthermore, we're interested in allowing our assembly team to reserve the necessary equipment ahead of time to ensure availability when needed. This would facilitate coordination among team members in case multiple individuals require the same equipment simultaneously. It seems like PRT could play a key role in this process, but I'm uncertain of the specifics. Thank you in advance for any insights you can provide!</p>

            <p>In the equipment master data, there is a Location field specifically for fixed equipment where you can record the room number or location code. When it comes to portable equipment, the Operation Area Supervisor (equipment owner) is responsible for ensuring that their equipment is available for scheduled maintenance orders. It is the duty of the Warehouse Supervisor/ Warehouse Operator to track the location of the forklift, not the Maintenance Mechanic who has a PM order. Prior to executing maintenance orders the next month, a report is sent to the Area Supervisors outlining the scheduled work on equipment under their care. This gives them an opportunity to prepare and locate the equipment. Failure to locate the equipment results in rescheduling the order and documenting the event. If the equipment is not received for PM by the end of the month, the Area Supervisor must provide a deviation report for not meeting the PM Schedule requirements. Despite having a field in the equipment master data to update equipment locations, it is improbable that Operations will consistently update it each time they move equipment within the plant. No data is available on the PRT.</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene, thank you for getting back to me. The maintenance department has a great idea of sending requests to the supervisor to make their equipment available for maintenance. This is why we are interested in tracking all our equipment and implementing a booking function. With this function, the supervisor can inform the operator that their equipment needs maintenance within a specific timeframe, such as two weeks. 

I came across information about PRT (Production Resources and Tools) which are materials used in activities but not consumed. These materials are reserved for specific activities and returned to circulation once the activity is completed. Examples include specialized cranes and drills, which have limited availability in the organization.

I believe I will need to classify my tools as equipment in SAP PM to add maintenance intervals, activities, and notifications. Following this, I anticipate that activities and booking functions will need to be integrated into SAP PS.</p>

            <p>I recently discovered a helpful resource on Production Resource Tools (PRT) that supports our understanding. This link (http://help.sap.com/saphelp_45b/helpdata/en/93/9b853478...b38f83b/frameset.htm) discusses the concept of "equipment PRTs", which are vital for maintaining production resources and tools. By utilizing PRT, you can effectively allocate these resources for both internal and external activities. This allocation helps determine the quantity, operating time, and necessary dates for carrying out various tasks.</p>

            <p>To optimize the efficiency of your equipment management system, it is essential to consistently update the PRT option or a table in MS Excel with vital information such as equipment ID, description, serial number, and current location in real time. This ensures that when Joe Mechanic begins his Monday morning shift and reviews his scheduled orders, he can access accurate information through the SAP R/3 system or Excel file. By doing so, he can avoid potential discrepancies like outdated data from last Thursday that is no longer relevant, ultimately improving workflow and productivity.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I have made significant progress on my project and have come across a new issue that I need help with. As you may recall, a crucial step in equipment maintenance is being able to locate it. I believe using functional locations as spatial criteria can help us determine the whereabouts of our equipment. To ensure we have accurate real-time data on equipment location, let's consider implementing barcode readers. For instance, if someone moves a piece of equipment to a different area of the building, they can simply scan the barcode on the equipment and the one in that zone. However, I am currently facing a challenge - I am unable to assign equipment to a functional location in SAP MM while it is still marked as 'in stock'. Although I want to utilize SAP MM for stock reports in our warehouse, I am unsure of how to address this issue. If anyone has any suggestions on how to tackle this problem, please feel free to share. I have also thought about designating the warehouse as a functional location, but I am uncertain if this is the best course of action. Any feedback or insights would be greatly appreciated!</p>

By designating the warehouse as a functional location, you can streamline operations by planning and executing tasks like painting walls, installing racks and shelving units, and optimizing equipment placement. However, it's important to note that attaching portable production equipment to the warehouse won't address all operational challenges.</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene, I have read the "Asset Tree" discussion as you mentioned. I completely agree with your comments on the situation. In SAP MM, when equipment is stored in a location, it is assumed to remain there until it is used in a project or attached to a functional location. This presents a challenge as you have pointed out. One possible solution could be to use the equipment in a project to assign it to a functional location. However, this approach may be cumbersome as it requires reentering the equipment into SAP MM every time it is returned to the warehouse. Alternatively, thinking outside the box, equipment such as a PRT should be managed in PM rather than MM, as it is not technically a material. This shift would allow for a clearer view of inventory in functional location warehouses. Thank you for discussing this topic with me, Eugene.</p>

            <p>Hey David, I came across a new release note that combines installation and disassembly steps with material documentation in just 5 lines. Using SAP ssng, handling one transaction and step can be a challenge on its own, so incorporating two tasks into one process is a potential game-changer. Has anyone had experience implementing this new functionality? I would appreciate insights from experts on the benefits of leveraging this transaction within the PLM extension 1.10.</p>

            <p>Hello MadMax, in addition to the MM approach, considering treating your functional locations as integral parts of the warehouse can be another valuable idea. This way, you simply need to carry out a goods movement from the stock to the functional location and vice versa once the job is completed. This streamlined process can enhance efficiency and organization within your operations.</p>

            <p>@David: Thank you for sharing the link - it's very intriguing! Can anyone provide information on where to locate this transaction and how to proceed? @Bob: Are you familiar with this transaction? In what context do you intend to use the installation and removal with simultaneous goods movement feature? @maintiger: I'm a bit confused about your message. Are you suggesting managing the "warehouse" in MM and transferring items to PM once they are utilized? If so, the concern is having to make two transactions unless, as David mentioned, it can be done in a single transaction from MM to the warehouse. Apologies for using German, just want to make sure I understood maintiger's point correctly.</p>

            <p>Hello Mad Max, I am unsure about the transaction as it was not mentioned in the release note. I am looking for expert opinions and experiences on whether this two-in-one transaction works smoothly or requires additional steps. It seems challenging to have the same person issuing materials and handling installation or dismantling. Will this task be carried out by the warehouse personnel or maintenance engineers? It appears that we may need to include additional tabs in the master data. I want to confirm before making any changes on my development server. Experts, your advice is greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hello MadMax, I see that you need tools for temporary use at the plant. These tools will be stored in a warehouse, and you want to know where to locate them when needed. I recommend treating these tools as regular inventory in your inventory management system (MM) for easy access when not in use (such as warehouse_1). You should also designate additional storage locations in MM for where the tools will be used (e.g. the turbine assembly area, designated as M_turbine). When a tool is needed, simply perform a material transfer from warehouse_1 to M_turbine. From MM's perspective, the tool remains in stock. Once the task is completed, transfer the tool back from M_turbine to warehouse_1. 

German Version:
Hallo MadMax, ich verstehe, dass du Werkzeuge vorübergehend auf der Anlage nutzen möchtest. Diese Werkzeuge werden aus einem Lager entnommen, und du möchtest wissen, wo sie sich befinden, wenn sie in Gebrauch sind. Ich empfehle, diese Werkzeuge in deinem Bestandsmanagementsystem (MM) einfach als reguläre Bestände zu führen, um sie bei Nichtgebrauch leicht finden zu können (z.B. in warehouse_1). Füge zusätzliche Lagerorte in MM hinzu, an denen die Werkzeuge verwendet werden (z.B. den Montagebereich für Turbinen, den wir M_turbine nennen). Wenn ein Werkzeug benötigt wird, führe einfach eine Materialbewegung von warehouse_1 nach M_turbine durch. Aus Sicht von MM bleibt das Werkzeug weiterhin im Lagerbestand. Nach Abschluss der Arbeit überführe das Werkzeug zurück von M_turbine nach warehouse_1.</p>

            <p>Hello Maintiger, thank you for your response! I now grasp your concept - you aim to establish additional MM storage sites to indicate our equipment's presence at m_turbine. However, there is a flaw in this approach: the system cannot accurately determine equipment availability once it enters a storage location, as it automatically becomes part of the inventory. MM lacks awareness that the m_turbine storage location signifies equipment use, and does not track duration. This oversight would omit the crucial PRT element, as a proper assignment to a work order is not feasible. I am eager to hear your thoughts on this matter! ;-)</p>

            <p>Hello Martin_, I see you're looking for my input. My suggestion is to create a clear and effective naming convention for your "production stores" by using something like "prod_xxxx." This will make it easier to track tools, such as the one in store "prod_m_turbine," and ensure accurate data within the system. Hopefully, this advice proves helpful.

            <p>Looking to optimize warehouse storage organization? In Materials Management (MM), storage locations are like hubs within warehouses or satellite stores, segmented into zones, locations, or bins. It's crucial to only designate legitimate storage spots that actually exist. Prioritize Proper Resource Training (PRT) when managing tools. If your current system isn't yielding optimal results, it's wise to evaluate your strategy rather than resorting to temporary solutions.</p>
