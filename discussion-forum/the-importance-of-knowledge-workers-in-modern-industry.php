            <p>Great job, everyone! I believe you have truly captured a common source of frustration for many businesses. This study highlights the importance of valuing employees and addressing the skills shortage, which is a significant threat in today's workforce. The recent conference of the WCEAM provided valuable insights that align well with this study. Investing in assets is crucial, and it's important to note that assets include more than just machinery. The overview on page 5 of the study has its merits, but I have my own thoughts on individuals of this caliber. It's not enough for them to simply support efforts; they should be leading and driving team development. I may not consider myself a natural educator or salesman, but companies often hire me to provide solutions for their physical assets. However, there should be a focus on broader capabilities and systems. Improvements often require training and development for core staff and team members. Industry needs top talent not just to solve immediate problems, but also to train the next generation of workers. It's essential for industry leaders to invest in educators rather than relying solely on heroic individuals. By placing top talent where they can make the most impact, companies can see significant improvements. Even though references like Deming, Juran, and Feigenbaum may be less popular now, the focus on training, development, and valuing the workforce over financial incentives remains crucial in today's business environment.</p>
