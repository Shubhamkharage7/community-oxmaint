                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As I advance in my learning process with TIA Portal v16, I am currently troubleshooting a machine that was recently installed at a client's facility. Upon their departure, they left a flash drive containing the PLC and HMI programs. After loading them onto my laptop and connecting to the CPU, I encountered discrepancies in the online and offline projects indicated by graphics in the project tree. Despite performing a thorough comparison, no differences were apparent. Even when attempting to display variances, the comparison remains stuck on network 1.

After deciding to start a new project and uploading the PLC (with the HMI pending), warnings about disparities persisted. This issue persisted even after trying to upload individual blocks. Considering the possibility of timestamp discrepancies, I investigated but found no option to overlook them. Feeling perplexed, I am considering making programming changes but am worried about successfully completing the download.

If anyone can offer insights or solutions to address the challenges depicted in the screenshot provided, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

            <p>Over the years, the comparison tool has undergone significant enhancements to provide more comprehensive details. In the latest version, V16, it is now capable of displaying differences in source code compiling and runtime performance. In cases where the source code is identical, the runtime variations become less significant.</p>
