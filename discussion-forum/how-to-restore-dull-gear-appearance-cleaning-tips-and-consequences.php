                    <p>After being stored for an extended period, a double helical gear set was sent for cleaning. Normally, new gears have a polished finish resembling freshly machined metal. However, upon return, the gear set had a dull gray appearance, likely cleaned with a corn cob blast or similar media that did not polish the metal. Have you encountered this issue before? Will there be any negative consequences if the gear set is installed correctly after being cleaned in this way? Share your insights.</p>

            <p>Is there a specific level of cleanliness required for the parts used in the gear application process? If the parts are not polished (such as fresh cut metal), should it be anticipated that the gear will produce more metal debris or dust compared to before?</p>

            <p>I am concerned about how this will impact tooth wear patterns and potential wear problems in areas where teeth mesh with a blast finish. Will this cause higher gear mesh vibration compared to a machined surface in a short amount of time? I am unsure of what to expect and whether this approach is considered a good, better, or best practice.</p>

            <p>Avoid grit blasting the gears when polishing metal, as it can be similar to continuously peeling off skin from a wound - it only exacerbates the issue. I remember instances where we replaced gears by washing away the old grease, cleaning the bearing seats with sandpaper, oiling the components, and putting them back into operation.</p>

            <p>Update: The gear that was sent out for cleaning was found to be very rusty, with a significant amount of pitting likely caused by the rust. A representative from a gear manufacturing and repair center will be visiting the site today to provide recommendations. The gear that was initially considered for replacement will remain in place for now. Additionally, the gear representative will offer best practices for addressing this damage. The gear had been stored improperly for approximately 25 years, as the current company owner has only been in place for 6 years and did not implement climate control measures. It has been suggested to review storage practices for all rotating equipment to prevent similar issues.</p>

            <p>Is it feasible to fix damaged gears through weld overlay on pitted areas and reshaping them to their original smoothness, or should a replacement be considered instead? Additionally, which AGMA specification governs the repair of gears?</p>

            <p>The equipment that underwent cleaning was recently inspected by a representative from the gear house. After inspection, it was returned to the shop for additional cleaning. I will be monitoring the progress and eagerly awaiting the outcome. While I am unsure of the specific specifications, I will be requesting detailed information.</p>

            <p>It's important to consider the heat treatment of the gear and its Rockwell "C" hardness value. If the gear has been hardened through induction heat treatment, it is unlikely that blasting would damage the teeth. However, if the gear has not been heat treated and has a low Rockwell "C" value, blasting could potentially cause irregularities in the teeth profile. This information is crucial to determining the impact of blasting on the gear's integrity and performance.</p>

            <p>According to the gear representative, the refurbished gear is superior to the existing one, largely due to its manufacturing process. Although specifics on this matter are currently unavailable. The decision has been made to put the unit back in operation and subsequently assess whether to replace or repair the gearbox.</p>
