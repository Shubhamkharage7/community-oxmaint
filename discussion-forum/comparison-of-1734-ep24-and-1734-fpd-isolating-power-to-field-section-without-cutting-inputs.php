                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello,
I am looking to isolate the power to the field section (cutting power to outputs but not inputs) - is this feature available with the FPD, or does the EP24DC also offer this capability? It appears that the power supplied to the EP24DC will be distributed to both the system and field, so cutting power to one will result in a fault in the entire IO-node. Considering the number of IO cards, would replacing the EP24 still be necessary? I am concerned about potential costs exceeding the budget.
Best regards,
Jon</p>

            <p>Utilize the Output Power Isolation feature of the FPD to effectively manage power distribution. The EP24DC serves to disconnect power from modules located to the left while supplying power to modules on the right. It is important to note that the EP24DC should not be used to trail a safety relay, as this can disrupt module communication power to subsequent modules, ultimately causing a rack fault. Make sure to carefully consider the power distribution plan to avoid any complications within the system.</p>

            <p>Field power distribution (FPD) supplies power to specific sections of the rack. In a setup like AENT-IB4-IB4-OB4-OB4-FPD-IB4-IB4-OB4-OB4, the first two output cards receive power from the 24VDC on the AENT, while the second two output cards are powered by the 24VDC on the FPD. The input common for the first two input cards is connected to the AENT, and the input common for the second two input cards is connected to the FPD.

On the other hand, the EP24DC not only supplies field power but also provides backplane power. In addition to the above, the EP24DC supplies 5V power to cards on the right to enable them to function properly.

Using an FPD is essential for isolating I/O field power in sections, while an EP24DC is necessary when the AENT cannot power all required cards. It is important to consider the maximum bus power available on your AENT (Note: AENTR can supply more bus power than AENT). Check the bus power requirements for each I/O module to determine when an EP24DC is needed.

A general rule of thumb is that around 8-10 cards can be powered by an AENTR before requiring an EP24DC. Cutting power to an FPD only affects field power, while cutting power to an EP24DC turns off cards completely, resulting in an I/O fault. It is important to carefully calculate power requirements to avoid any issues in your setup.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your guidance. I plan to utilize the IAB tool on the AB website to size the nodes based on power and determine the FPD. AB has cautioned about potential data cap limits with multiple analog cards and advised against excessive use of the AENTR to prevent one node from dominating traffic.</p>
