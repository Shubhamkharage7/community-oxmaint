                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>For the past 3 years, our company has been utilizing SAP-PM for managing work orders. One challenge we are facing involves transitioning from generating sub-work orders in Maximo to assigning operations to a crew ID in SAPPM. The goal is to streamline the process and avoid sub-work orders, but we are seeking a way to categorize order types within the work orders. In SAP, once an order has been assigned an order type in the operation, it cannot be changed. Our company's preferred approach is to consolidate all work, including assigned and reactive tasks, within a single order to simplify cost tracking. However, this poses reporting challenges when distinguishing between reactive and scheduled tasks. While it is possible to report on the crew ID, it does not accurately reflect whether the order was an emergency or priority within a scheduled task. Any suggestions or solutions for effectively categorizing order types without solely relying on keywords from the operations would be greatly appreciated.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>You can consolidate the costs of all sub work orders into the main work order, allowing you to utilize the main work order for cost tracking and the sub work orders for scheduling and reactive maintenance. Best regards, Tehsin.</p>

            <p>I am unclear about the connection between Maximo and SAP, but key fields to consider for SAP operations include the Control Key and Activity Type. The Control Key poses a limitation as confirmations entered against an operation cannot be altered afterwards, which can be either a disadvantage or an advantage. Conversely, the Activity Type allows those entering confirmations to override the setting in the work order operation. It is recommended to initially focus on the Control Key. Additionally, the Standard Text Key field is another viable option to explore.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How can we effectively categorize order types in SAP-PM without solely relying on keywords from the operations?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - One possible solution could be to utilize user-defined fields or custom fields within the work order to categorize different types of orders. This way, you can have a specific field indicating whether the task is reactive, scheduled, emergency, or priority.
  
2. Is it possible to streamline the process and avoid sub-work orders in SAP-PM while consolidating all work within a single order?
   - Yes, it is possible to consolidate all work, including assigned and reactive tasks, within a single order in SAP-PM. By properly categorizing order types and utilizing custom fields, you can simplify cost tracking and reporting while avoiding the need for sub-work orders.</p>
