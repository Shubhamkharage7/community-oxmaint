                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, in our facility, we utilize multiple 3HP 460V motors controlled by VFDs to operate conveyor belts. A recurring issue we are facing is that the drives are experiencing random motor overload faults when instructed to start by the PLC. Despite thorough inspections, my team has not been able to identify any mechanical or electrical issues with the systems. When the problem arises, the motor emits a humming sound, the belt/motor fails to rotate, and the VFD enters a current limit mode. Typically, the motors operate at 50 to 75% of their rated current.

Upon analyzing the fault data collected by the drive, we observed a negative output frequency of approximately -3Hz (compared to the commanded frequency of +57Hz). Through the drive software, we noticed that during the acceleration ramp, the output frequency intermittently drops below zero before reaching the set frequency. At times, it remains in negative values, leading to the aforementioned symptoms until resulting in an overload fault. Following the manufacturer's recommendation, we performed an autotune which seems to have resolved the issue. Can anyone provide insights into the root cause of this motor or VFD issue, as the manufacturer was unable to offer a satisfactory explanation?</p>
