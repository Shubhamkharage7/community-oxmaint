            <p>The pumps are operating smoothly, rotating freely to handle hydrocarbon products. The motor size has been verified by the pump vendor to prevent undersizing issues. Product specific gravity has been confirmed to align with the pump design, ensuring optimal performance. However, a concern arises as the motors are drawing high amperage, indicating an overload situation. Identifying the root cause of this issue is crucial. What other factors should be examined to troubleshoot and resolve this problem effectively?</p>

            <p>Have you verified the motor overload trip setting? This step is essential to ensure that your motor is operating efficiently and safely. Remember to always check and adjust the overload settings as needed to prevent any potential damage or malfunctions. Keeping this in check will help extend the lifespan of your motor and improve its overall performance.</p>

            <p>If the pump is correctly sized and the rotation, voltage, and load are in alignment, the electric motor will perform its job efficiently. It is essential to ensure that the panel is set up correctly with appropriate overloads to prevent overloading issues. Even a small 1/4" difference in impeller size can lead to overloading, so it is crucial to adjust the output and monitor the amps. As an experienced electric motor shop owner, it appears that the load may be too high. It is important to investigate the root cause of the overload.</p>

            <p>Possible causes of issues with a motor include mechanical overload, low voltage, unbalanced voltage, incorrect trip settings, and malfunctioning trip devices. To troubleshoot, measure the current on all three phases and check for balance. It's essential to know the motor's nameplate voltage, full load amps (or horsepower), and estimated terminal voltage. Additionally, consider the motor's nameplate speed and actual measured speed to calculate power. For pumps, factors like differential pressure (dp), flow rate, and efficiency are crucial in determining shaft horsepower. Viscosity may also play a role, especially for hydrocarbon pumps. Keep in mind that colder fluid temperatures may increase pumping power requirements. Lastly, check if the motor is driven by a VFD.</p>

The comprehensive list provided by the McNally Institute is quite helpful. Are the newly installed motors still covered under warranty? Have they been fully paid for? Typically, holding the final payment prompts a swift response. Does anyone have insights on why my new post is appearing at the top rather than the end of the thread?

            <p>Why does my new post appear at the top of the thread instead of the end? The mystery remains unsolved. Forums can be set up in two standard ways: 1) in chronological order or 2) with the original post on top followed by reverse chronological order. The latter has its advantages, especially for longer threads where users may only want to see the newest posts. This site follows the second method in the "Posts About Improving Reliability" forum, while other forums on the site use the first method. Consistency within the site is important to me. I have raised this issue in another thread and flagged it for the administrator, but Terry has not addressed it yet.</p>

            <p>When troubleshooting pump issues, it is important to ensure that the system being supplied by the pump does not have excessive resistance to flow. I will provide a test plot as an example, featuring an ash agitator pump that experienced this issue. The pump's discharge pipe nozzle had detached, causing the pump to attempt to increase flow to compensate. However, this led to the pump exceeding its motor rating and trip setting. It is crucial to regularly inspect and maintain pumps to prevent such issues from occurring.</p>

            <p>While reviewing our KSB manuals this morning, I found a suggestion regarding high amperage issues: Check if the actual back pressure is below the specified level. If it is, increasing back pressure may be necessary. This issue can be likened to oversizing or insufficient resistance to flow, as highlighted by Ray BeeBe. It could be compared to an overspeed condition in internal combustion engines or driving a Porsche with motorcycle brakes. Am I overlooking any other potential factors at play here?</p>

            <p>Quote: At the moment, multiple pumps are being run in parallel to prevent motor overload and tripping. It is important to note that running two pumps in parallel will result in increased back pressure, as it is directly related to the flow rate. To address this issue, consider adjusting a valve in the discharge line (avoiding gate or block valves). Additionally, check if there is a control valve in place to regulate the flow effectively. This adjustment can help optimize the performance and efficiency of the pumps.</p>

We are currently identifying the root cause of the ARV malfunction. We appreciate all the suggestions shared thus far and eagerly await more input. Have a great day! - Mohammad</p>
