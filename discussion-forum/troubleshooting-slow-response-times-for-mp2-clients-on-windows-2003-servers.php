                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In recent months, our MP2 clients have been experiencing periodic freezing issues on the first day of the month. This occurs multiple times a day, lasting for 15-20 minutes each time. The problem affects clients using Windows 2003 Terminal Servers and Workstations, but the CPU, memory, and network usage on the Windows 2003 SQL 2005 server appear to be normal. Despite checking the Windows event viewer, no issues have been reported. We have several MP2 databases on the SQL server, with only one exhibiting this problem. Interestingly, users accessing other MP2 databases during the same period do not encounter any freezing. These databases are smaller in size and have fewer users. The last time this issue occurred, there were 15 connected users. We are seeking advice on troubleshooting this problem. Is there additional MP2 logging that can be activated for further investigation? The cause could be attributed to an overload of user activities or someone running a large report. Our setup includes SQL Server Edition Version 6.1 Build 20061031, Windows 2003 R2 SP2, and SQL 2005 SP3. Any insights are appreciated. Thank you, Cory.</p>

            <p>Are you utilizing SQL Server 2005 Express or Professional? When the system freezes, what typically causes this issue? There have been instances where certain tables in the database had ownership corrupted, causing the system to lock up whenever a MP2 user tried to access them.</p>

            <p>Hello Jonathan, I wanted to update you on the activities that were being carried out when the clients experienced freezing issues recently. On Friday, one user was creating purchase requisitions and after the issue was resolved, he successfully completed 40 requisitions. This is the usual amount he handles twice a week. Around the same time, I was researching information in the Work Order History form for a specific equipment. Additionally, the tool cribs were conducting their weekly inventory cycle counts, which involves opening and printing a pre-existing report. Once the counting is done, they input the new stock levels into the system. Thank you for your attention to this matter. -Cory</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Having a large amount of historical data can potentially lead to slow performance in the PR generation process. Conducting cycle counts and generating basic reports should not result in the MP2 program freezing up. How many years of historical data are you currently storing? Have you considered archiving older data to improve system efficiency?</p>

            <p>It seems that no archiving has been conducted since 2006, resulting in a backlog of over 200,000 work orders and 95,000 purchase requests. This accumulation of historical data raises the question of whether this volume is considered excessive. -Cory</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  What could be causing the periodic freezing issues experienced by MP2 clients on Windows 2003 Servers?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The cause of the freezing issues could be due to an overload of user activities or someone running a large report on the MP2 database.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I troubleshoot slow response times for MP2 clients on Windows 2003 Servers?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: To troubleshoot the slow response times, you can consider activating additional MP2 logging for further investigation. Additionally, monitoring user activities and reports being run during the freezing periods can help identify the root cause.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Why are only certain MP2 databases affected by the freezing issues on the first day of the month?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The freezing issues may be specific to a particular MP2 database due to its size, number of users, or the type of activities being performed on it. Smaller databases with fewer users may not encounter the same problems.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4.  Is there a recommended approach for addressing freezing issues on MP2 clients connected to Windows 2003 Terminal Servers and Workstations?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: It is advisable to investigate the system resources on the SQL server hosting the MP2 databases, monitor user activities, and consider optimizing performance by identifying any resource-intensive processes or reports causing the slowdowns.</p>
