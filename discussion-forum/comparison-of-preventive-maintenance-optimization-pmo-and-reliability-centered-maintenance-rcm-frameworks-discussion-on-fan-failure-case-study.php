                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Dear Steve,

I would like to discuss your example on pages 25 and 26 regarding the Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) framework. In the example, the function of the system is to provide 20 horsepower to the fan, ensuring that it spins at 200 revolutions per minute (rpm). The functional failure in this case is the complete loss of power. The potential failure modes include gear wear and cracking due to fatigue, among others.

Based on the severity of the risk associated with fan failure, it seems reasonable to implement proactive vibration monitoring as a preventive maintenance task. Do you agree with this assessment? 

For the functional failure of "No Power Supply," potential failure modes could include tripped motor breakers, cable faults, earth faults on the motor, or interruptions in mains power. In the case of a transmission failure, potential modes could include worn or sheared motor couplings, especially if they are geared couplings.

It is important to consider other proactive maintenance tasks, such as earth-resistance testing and lubrication of couplings, to address potential causes of functional failures. Vibration monitoring may not be as effective in preventing functional failures related to loss of power. Instead, it can be useful for detecting gearbox failures, in which case oil condition monitoring should also be considered.

I hope we can agree on the importance of these points for ensuring the reliability of the system.

Sincerely, [Your Name]</p>

            <p>In most cases, when a "motor breaker trips," it is usually a result of another issue, not a failure mode. The breaker is often working correctly by preventing further damage caused by an underlying problem.</p>

            <p>In order to aid other readers, here is the complete text that Vee wishes to address: Exploring the utilization of PMO in consolidating and analyzing multiple failure modes, as opposed to RCM which evaluates each failure mode individually. PMO streamlines the process by listing multiple failure modes under one maintenance task, reducing analysis time significantly. For instance, when tasked with performing a Vibration Analysis on a Gearbox using PMO, various failure modes such as gear wear, cracks, bearing failure, mounting bolts becoming loose, and coupling failure can be grouped together. By grouping these failure modes, PMO can determine the most efficient inspection interval for preventing unexpected occurrences. On the other hand, RCM focuses on functions and individual failure modes, resulting in a more extensive analysis process. Ultimately, both PMO and RCM may lead to the same maintenance program, with the main difference being the approach to analyzing and managing failure modes.</p>

            <p>quote: It seems that the risk associated with fan failure is significant enough to justify implementing proactive vibration monitoring. Is my assumption accurate? Please respond with a simple Yes or No. The answer is Yes. I agree with all your points, except for the circuit breaker and power failure issues. In the context of this scenario, I am showcasing how PMO2000 differs from RCM with a specific example. Following your suggestion would require me to present a complete fan RCM Analysis and a complete PMO2000 analysis for just one point. I believe that the example effectively serves its purpose and that my paper is sufficient as it stands.</p>

            <p>Steve, I appreciate your insights regarding the breaker and external power interruptions. Your system boundary appears to exclude the motor starter/push-button station and electrical terminations, which I understand, although I typically include these components in my RCM studies. I will revisit the discussion on system boundaries later; for now, I am focused on comprehending the specific scenario you presented. The occurrence of an earth fault in the motor falls within this system, unless the motor is not considered part of the power train. I am curious about proactive measures for addressing the earth fault failure mode, and I believe input from an electrical expert would be valuable. Additionally, your analysis identifies worn couplings as another potential failure mode, which I agree with. This suggests there are internal parts in contact and moving relative to one another. Assuming it is a Moss Gear type coupling, it would require lubrication and regular maintenance. I seek clarification on the specific details of your example, and I kindly ask for your confirmation or corrections to my interpretation. For now, I am withholding any comments on your analysis until I fully grasp the situation. Your assistance in clarifying these details with simple Yes/No responses would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>In this section, we are focusing on how PMO2000 groups failure modes into a single record, while RCM separates them. This distinction is one of the reasons why PMO2000 is considered to be faster. While there are numerous other failure modes not listed here, the main purpose of this paper section is not to cover every single one.</p>

            <p>Steve, I appreciate your input and assistance. As a proficient RCM expert, it would be beneficial to showcase the insights that an RCM analysis can provide, including the additional work involved and the potential benefits. Providing a comprehensive view of the costs and advantages would offer readers a well-rounded understanding. I am uncertain whether PMO 2000 considers 'earth fault' as a valid failure mode or if it includes motor failures when assessing for 'no power'. In an RCM analysis, these factors would typically be taken into account. While it is clear that gear box failure would lead to 'no power', there may be other components in the power train that could also result in power loss. The specific task you chose for reverse engineering is 'vibration analysis', but are there other tasks that align with the scenarios I mentioned earlier? It is possible that the example you used was hypothetical, but considering your extensive experience in RCM and PMO 2000, it would be valuable to draw from real-life examples in your records. My goal is to fully comprehend the case at hand without having to make assumptions.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the evaluation of failure modes within PMO 2000 and RCM methodologies, the identification of all potential failure modes that could lead to functional failure is crucial. SAE JA 1011 specifies that all failure modes reasonably likely to cause each functional failure must be considered, with a focus on identifying failure modes at a level of causation that allows for appropriate failure management policies. This includes listing failure modes that have occurred in the past, those currently prevented by maintenance programs, and those deemed reasonably likely to occur in the future.

When applying RCM to assets like a car engine, it is important to prioritize the evaluation of failure modes based on current maintenance programs, past failures, and potential future failures with significant consequences. While detailed evaluations of every component may not be practical, including relevant failure modes like an 'earth fault' is essential unless it is deemed highly unlikely to occur. The main objective is not to list every conceivable failure mode, but to create a comprehensive maintenance program that addresses critical issues and avoids missing any crucial failure modes.

During the rationalization and review of failure modes, task duplication can be identified and addressed. This involves ensuring that the same failure modes are not being managed redundantly by different sections within the organization. By reviewing failure modes generated through analysis and incorporating missing failures based on historical data, technical documentation, and team experience, a more effective maintenance program can be developed.

Overall, the focus is on creating a maintenance program that covers a majority of failure modes through existing programs, while also addressing any gaps to ensure comprehensive coverage. The emphasis is on practicality and efficiency, aiming to optimize maintenance efforts without overlooking critical failure modes.</p>

As someone with extensive experience in both RCM and PMO 2000, you should easily be able to select a real-world example from your own records. My goal is to thoroughly understand the case without having to make any assumptions. I have a training example that could be useful for this purpose, although I have not included it in my paper due to its length. Even in popular textbooks like Moubray, complete analyses are often not shown. I believe sharing an example would be a compelling way to persuade skeptics of my assertions, or alternatively, to uncover any unintentional misinformation on my part. Perhaps we should start a new thread specifically for this example.</p>

            <p>Steve, let's focus on the current example to enhance our understanding. If failure modes are expected to occur and lead to maintenance or modification actions, PMO2000 would address them. Specifically, I want to know if PMO 2000 covers failure modes such as earth faults or motor faults (e.g. motor starter or cable terminations). Can you, wearing your PMO 2000 hat, determine whether a 'maintenance or modification action' is likely to be necessary and explain your reasoning? Let's stick to this example for now to streamline our discussion and avoid confusion. We can always revisit the car example at a later time or in a separate thread if you'd like to discuss it further.</p>

            <p>In regards to the failure modes, such as earth fault or other motor faults, it is important to consider whether they should be included in the analysis using PMO 2000. Regarding earth fault, the answer is yes. However, for other motor faults, it is advised not to include them as they are considered vague and not suitable for RCM analysis. When it comes to motor starters, they should be included in the analysis only if there is a history of failures. Cable terminations, on the other hand, should always be included as electricians usually have scheduled maintenance tasks for them. If not, they will inform you that the terminations require maintenance.</p>

            <p>In regards to Earth Fault and other motor faults, it is important to analyze specific failure modes to ensure equipment reliability. Motor starters should be checked for failure history, while cable terminations should also be examined. These failure modes are typically associated with the functional failure of "No Power". In a PMO 2000 analysis, a generic task for testing earth faults, junction boxes, or terminations in the CMMS may trigger further investigation.

            <p>When utilizing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), it is important to identify failure modes associated with functional failures such as "No Power". These failure modes can be located under the specific function within the selected equipment, such as a fan. 

In conducting a PMO 2000 analysis, it is crucial to determine if generic tasks within the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) trigger inquiries related to earth fault testing, junction boxes, terminations, etc. Additionally, it is essential to establish the link between the identified fan and its specific tag. 

While RCM emphasizes starting with function, PMO2000 does not prioritize function as its core. Understanding the consequences of failure is key, as consequences stem from loss of function. Failure modes, which are closely tied to equipment, play a crucial role in maintenance. 

In an Enterprise Asset Management (EAM)/CMMS system, the focus is on managing equipment rather than functions. This approach simplifies the process for users who can easily access information on equipment, failure modes, strategies, and consequences. Overall, this equipment-focused approach presents a more intuitive solution compared to RCM.</p>

            <p>Steve, I would appreciate your direct response to my inquiries. I am seeking clarity on the criteria for determining the timing and frequency of tasks within PMO 2000, specifically in relation to RCM task selection criteria. While we typically rely on the SAE criteria, we are open to using a client's preferred solution. I am interested in understanding the scheduling aspect ('when' not 'what') of tasks such as earth-fault or terminations inspections. Can you provide an estimate, such as every 2 years or every 6 months? Additionally, I am curious about the inclusion of specific failure modes in a PMO 2000 analysis and how they are triggered, either through a CMMS task or another method. Furthermore, I would like to know the link to the specific tag of the fan selected for analysis. Your expertise in fan analysis should make addressing these questions straightforward.</p>

            <p>In engineering, it is important to understand the difference between functional failure and consequence. While functional failure refers to the loss of function of a machine, consequence goes beyond that to encompass a range of potential outcomes that can vary depending on the specific circumstances. For example, a generator stopping while running is a functional failure, while the consequences may include a blackout due to lack of standby power, with a recovery time of 2 hours, or a seized machine bearing leading to major internal damage and a recovery time of 6 months. It is crucial to distinguish between these concepts as they are related but distinct in their implications. Understanding the potential consequences of functional failures is essential for effective maintenance and risk management.</p>

In accordance with the PMO2000 process, the RCM decision logic is recommended, and we provide training on the RCM approach for establishing task intervals. This information can be found in Sections 5.5 to 5.8 of the RCM Standard. During a discussion with Dana Netherton and John Moubray, the term "RCM Task Selection Criteria" was suggested instead of "RCM decision logic" to avoid confusion.</p>

            <p>Quote: While Consequence and Functional Failure are closely related, they are distinct terms. Consequence refers to what occurs when a failure results in the loss of function. It encompasses more than just function and cannot be described without understanding the function that is compromised. It is essential to recognize that Consequence includes function and is of greater importance than understanding the function alone. When facing a potential failure, it is crucial to not only report the loss of function to the plant manager but also to detail the impact of that loss. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) begins with a focus on function, while Preventive Maintenance Optimization (PMO) starts with tasks, indirectly addressing equipment as tasks inherently involve equipment inspections. Starting from a blank slate, RCM prioritizes understanding function, essential for effectively addressing consequences.</p>

            <p>Before any PMO2000 workshop, extensive time is dedicated to preparing information worksheets. The program is thoroughly broken down to list each task corresponding to every equipment asset. Additionally, we validate the configuration of libraries previously identified. When conducting a PMO 2000 analysis, it is essential to determine the whereabouts of specific failure modes such as earth fault testing, junction boxes, or terminations. This can be triggered by a generic task in the CMMS or through alternative methods. The identification of failure modes from a generic routine in the CMMS is crucial. The connection to the specific fan tag chosen must be established, either through a list of tags or other specified means. Proper preparation for these workshops is key. For instance, analyzing 70,000 tags required the effort of two to three individuals over a month and specialized software code to organize the data efficiently. Ultimately, the results were impressive, with all 70,000 tags analyzed within eight months and re-integrated into the system in another 12 months. In comparison, a traditional RCM approach tackled only 1,500 tags in two to three years, highlighting the superior speed of the PMO2000 software. Trying to handle such tasks on a spreadsheet is not recommended; purpose-built software like PMO2000 is the most suitable choice, offering RCM capabilities as well. Those looking to implement RCM for 20% of critical assets can do so effortlessly with our software solution.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, that's an excellent question. Can a consultant validate the accuracy of the task and frequency input provided by an electrician? If a maintenance strategy is found to be faulty or inadequate after a PMO review, will the consultant stand alongside the owner in defense? From my personal perspective, our role in conducting workshops involves training individuals in analysis methods. We evaluate their logic against the RCM Decision Diagram. If the logic doesn't align, we document the group's input and address our concerns with company management for further review. Our approach is not to argue with the team but to facilitate understanding and consensus. While we may have differing opinions, we aim to uncover the rationale behind each perspective. Proper training in concepts can lead to a shift in thinking and acceptance of new methodologies. Some entrenched practices may be rooted in tradition, but with the right education, individuals can adapt and embrace change. It's crucial to dig deep into the reasoning behind beliefs to uncover logical explanations. While legislation may influence decisions, a closer examination often reveals flaws in irrational methods. These nuanced considerations play a significant role in the decision-making process. Feel free to share your thoughts on this approach, as there is no definitive right or wrong answer.</p>

            <p>Josh, your comment raises an intriguing point that can be interpreted in multiple ways. In an ideal world, organizations could operate like computer programs, where we can change the code and see immediate results. However, people and organizations do not function in such a linear manner. They require time to evolve and adapt.

Our approach is to encourage organizations to take incremental steps forward, rather than expecting immediate transformation. We understand that perfection is not always attainable and sometimes settling for a slightly imperfect solution is more efficient in the long run.

While some may argue that prioritizing efficiency may compromise quality, we believe in setting a high standard of quality and then refining our processes to achieve that standard in the most effective way possible. When dealing with a large number of components, we focus on analyzing a select few that have the most impact, rather than getting lost in the details of every single component.

We acknowledge the importance of considering how each component interacts with others and strive to avoid overlooking any potential failures. By creating clones for specific circumstances, we ensure that critical factors are addressed without getting lost in minor details.

At the end of the day, our goal is to strike a balance between quality and efficiency. Whether utilizing RCM or PMO2000, the emphasis remains on achieving the desired outcomes rather than the specific process used.

Our aim is to demonstrate that PMO2000 can deliver the same maintenance program as RCM, despite some skepticism. We welcome any challenges or questions regarding our approach. Regards, Steve</p>

            <p>Steve, I concur with your point that consequences occur when there is a failure leading to a loss of function. In a previous conversation, you mentioned that "Consequence by definition is loss of function" in a very assertive manner. I preferred to hold off on the debate until I had a better grasp of your paper. To ensure we stay on track with our discussion on consequences, allow me to clarify my understanding: 1. Maintenance is done to reduce or eliminate consequences. 2. Consequences stem from functional failures, essentially being the outcomes of such failures. Do you agree with these statements?</p>

            <p>Steve, I posed two straightforward inquiries and even proposed potential solutions. First, where can we locate these two missing failure modes in a PMO 2000 analysis? Will a generic task for earth fault testing or other similar tasks in the CMMS trigger this investigation? They should either be found within a CMMS task or identified through another method. Additionally, how can we access the specific tag of the fan you have chosen? If the tag is included in the routine, please provide the link. If not, kindly specify an alternative method. These questions pertain to your analysis of the fan and should be easily addressed. Despite a lengthy response, I still find myself puzzled by your answers. Remember: 1. This is your own example, not one I created. 2. The most significant consequence is "No power." 3. It appears that other potential causes for the failure, such as earth faults or loose terminations, were not considered. If they were overlooked, why the hesitation in providing the information I am seeking?</p>

In case you're unaware, I refer to a tag as a Power Generator Driver, specifically a 20MW Gas Turbine, not simply the gearbox of a fan.</p>

            <p>Hey Vee, the example I provided in my paper serves a different purpose than what you're trying to understand. If you want to delve into these questions, we'll need an example that aligns with your query. I've quoted the entire example (Posted 07 November 2009 04:02 PM) to give you a clear idea of its context. More than 100 words later, I still can't comprehend your response. 1. This example is yours, not one I came up with. 2. The key outcome here is "No power." 3. It seems the example overlooked other potential causes for the functional failure, such as no power. This could be one of the 'advantages' you mentioned. If it did take into account factors like earth fault or loose terminations, why the hesitance in providing the information I'm looking for?</p>

            <p>I am a professional trainer specializing in teaching PMO2000 and reliability improvement methods to individuals and organizations. While I do not consider myself a design engineer, electrician, or motor mechanic, I am experienced in providing guidance on utilizing knowledge effectively. By using techniques such as RCM decision logic, I assist clients in streamlining their thought processes and knowledge to enhance their operations. 

I do not write maintenance programs for organizations; instead, I focus on facilitating the implementation of existing methods. Companies hire me for my expertise in software and facilitation skills, allowing them to achieve tangible results. While we avoid certain methods we deem unsafe, we are open to utilizing alternative approaches that align with the client's preferences.

As expert facilitators, our role is not to replace industry-specific professionals like electricians. If a client requires expert advice on writing electrical PM, they should hire a qualified electrician or engage my services to support the process. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with the client or industry standards like the SAE task selection criteria. 

In cases where maintenance strategies are questioned, the client or industry standards should take the lead in addressing any issues that may arise. It is crucial for clients to clarify the role of experts before entering into agreements to avoid misunderstandings.

            <p>Steve, in your quote, you emphasized the importance of minimizing costs without overlooking the potential consequences. It's crucial to understand that while not all consequences may lead to measurable costs, every cost incurred is indeed a consequence. In a previous discussion, you defined consequence as a loss of function, but it seems there may have been some confusion. Now, you seem to suggest that cost is not necessarily a consequence. You previously mentioned that in my perspective, "function was the center of the Universe," and that your approach involves assessing equipment, failure modes, and failure consequences. It appears that our interpretations of the term 'consequence' differ, as you do not consider cost to fall under this category.</p>

            <p>Vee, it appears this discussion is veering away from addressing the core issues. It seems there is a group, including yourself, that has reservations about maintenance strategy development approaches that deviate from Classical RCM. Instead of nitpicking at my suggestions, let's take a fresh approach by establishing functional requirements with the goal of establishing a robust maintenance program and then evaluating each process accordingly. To save time, I will address the common misconception that there are flaws in the assessment of tasks and intervals. Both PMO and RCM follow identical processes in this regard. The main difference between RCM and PMO2000 lies in the scope and number of failure modes analyzed. They share the same post-failure mode processes. The primary concern is whether PMO2000 overlooks failure modes that require maintenance, which RCM would identify. I argue that PMO2000 does not overlook these failure modes. Your counterargument must prove otherwise. It is essential to demonstrate that the preventable failure modes identified in PMO2000 cover all necessary maintenance tasks compared to RCM. If you can successfully do so, it would indicate a deficiency in PMO2000; if not, the hypothesis is invalid. It may be beneficial to test this aspect of each method for clarity.</p>

            <p>It appears that there is a misunderstanding about my use of a process similar to PMO 2000 since 1998. While I do utilize this process for non-critical systems, it is not a flashy commercial product but rather a tool that I have experience with. I am familiar with both the advantages and disadvantages of such systems. It is important to demonstrate that the pool of preventable failure modes identified by PMO2000 is not inferior to RCM. Failure to provide concise answers to simple questions indicates a lack of transparency. There seems to be a pattern of avoiding direct responses and instead focusing on discussing the use of PMO 2000. This lack of direct communication is a significant issue that needs to be addressed.</p>

            <p>Steve, let's give it another shot. I will recap what we have previously agreed on to avoid repetition. If you disagree with any of these points, please clarify. a. According to your RCM analysis, 'No Power' is considered an unacceptable failure. b. The occurrence of an 'earth fault' can lead to 'No Power'. c. 'Loose/wet terminations' as a failure mode can also result in 'No Power'. d. Your analyst does not possess the technical expertise of a designer or electrician. If you find these statements acceptable, under your PMO 2000 approach, how will these failure modes be identified by the analyst? The potential responses are as follows: 1. Each of these failure modes is addressed in a specific routine within the EAM/CMMS. 2. A generic routine tackling, for example, the 'earth fault' failure mode is accessible. 3. If option 2 is chosen, how is the specific component 'fan motor' connected? 4. Alternatively, if an earth fault has occurred previously on this motor or others, a review of corrective maintenance work orders will uncover it. 5. In cases where there isn't a routine or corrective work order available, the analyst will rely on the guidance of an electrician. A simple Yes/No response is all that is needed for each of the aforementioned points (a-d and 1-5). It's possible for the answers to overlap.</p>

            <p>Hello Subject Matter Experts, Both RCM and PM02000 are valuable tools to assist customers in improving equipment maintenance. As someone who is not an expert in the field, I have observed that customers often feel overwhelmed and unsure about which approach to take. The lack of emphasis on basic care maintenance and the lack of guidance on advancing maintenance concepts can lead to confusion. While RCM and PM02000 provide valuable equipment studies, they are only beneficial if customer engineers can clearly see the advantages. It is better to conduct these studies imperfectly than not at all. Ultimately, customer engineers must be able to effectively utilize study outcomes to develop improved maintenance strategies. Whether it is RCM or PM02000 analysis, these are essential engineering studies for equipment. In the case of electrical equipment, hidden failures are more common than in mechanical equipment, where evident failures are easier to address. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. By implementing the right engineering practices for each specific piece of equipment, reliability can be maintained. 

Recently, I was asked by a customer in the oil and gas industry whether maintenance tasks are necessary for new equipment and if maintenance activities can be skipped. In my opinion, if reliable products are selected, undergo a good FAT acceptance, and are properly installed, minimal visual inspections should suffice for at least five years. Do you agree with this approach?</p>

            <p>Lammie, quote: Basic maintenance care is often overlooked, but it is crucial for advancing reliability. In my opinion, approximately half of reliability improvements stem from properly maintaining machinery. This involves ensuring the machine remains dry, clean, lubricated, aligned, balanced, and with tight bolts. Adhering to work orders and operating the machine with care is also essential. Neglecting these basics can render more advanced maintenance efforts futile. Moreover, conducting such maintenance studies serves as a valuable training tool and emphasizes the significance of foundational maintenance practices. It is important to prioritize investments in these areas judiciously.</p>

            <p>According to Lammie, regular maintenance may not be necessary if you opt for high-quality products with good FAT acceptance and proper installation, as long as you conduct minor visual inspections every five years. However, the reliability of any item decreases over time due to factors like fouling, environmental conditions, and lubrication oil oxidation. While degradation is a natural process that can be managed, it cannot be completely eliminated. As internal parts wear out and metal components experience fatigue, the machine's reliability will inevitably decline without timely attention to these degradation mechanisms. In most cases, maintenance should begin as soon as the machine is put into use, although there are exceptions like consumer products such as watches or computers, which may not require maintenance for a year or more. Precision equipment operating in stable, low-stress environments is also an exception. Therefore, there may be some disagreement with the assertion that maintenance is unnecessary for reliable products.</p>

            <p>Steve, I want to clarify that I do not believe my advertising is misleading, and I make a clear distinction between what can be debated and what cannot. Your use of words like 'misleading' does not contribute to a constructive conversation, in my opinion. In a previous instance, you inserted the word 'important' into a statement from N&H, which seemed to exaggerate its significance. You justified this by citing your familiarity with English, but in my opinion, this distorted the original meaning. It appears you are trying to distort it again with your recent addition.</p>

            <p>Could it be that the PMO 2000 did not take into account these failure modes because they were not as apparent at the time of writing the paper? No, Vee. When I wrote the paper, I used this example to depict something entirely different from what you are trying to convey. If you wish to delve into the failure modes incorporated in the analysis, please refer to the section of the paper titled "Methodological differences between RCM and PMO" with the diagram provided on page 21 that highlights the point. I find it surprising that you want to convince readers of the superior performance of PMO 2000 with an example that you yourself do not consider a thorough analysis. Vee, in your book on risk and reliability strategies, you discussed numerous techniques but did not include a single worked example. Yet you are surprised that my brief paper lacks one? This inconsistency is worth noting.</p>

            <p>Quote: Cost as a Consequence Not all consequences result in measurable costs, but every cost is a consequence. In a previous discussion, it was mentioned that consequences inherently involve a loss of function, but that viewpoint was later retracted. There seems to be confusion as to whether cost is considered a consequence. While it was suggested that my perspective revolves around function being paramount, it is important to understand that cost is indeed a consequence in my understanding. It appears that there is a misunderstanding of the term 'Consequence', especially in relation to costs. Despite attempts to present unrelated arguments, the core of my statement remains unchanged – emphasizing the importance of functional analysis in Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Functional analysis serves as the foundation of RCM, leading to the identification of Functional Failures and Failure Modes. Recognizing function is crucial in RCM for establishing starting points and performance benchmarks for maintenance activities. Contrary to PMO2000's approach, we prioritize detailed functional analysis in workshops by outlining equipment schematics, functions, operating conditions, and failure characteristics. While PMO2000 may not mandate documented functional analysis, it does emphasize documenting consequences, which are intrinsically linked to understanding function. In this context, consequences are described as outcomes resulting from a loss of function. It is important to note that maintenance is not solely about minimizing consequences but rather managing plant operations cost-effectively. Sometimes, a more expensive maintenance strategy can yield greater revenue. It is essential to clarify that at no point did I suggest that cost is not a consequence.</p>

            <p>Steve pointed out that Vee's book on risk and reliability strategies lacks worked examples, even though it discusses various techniques. The book primarily focuses on risk management, specifically not just RCM. For examples, readers can refer to section 9.4 (pages 163-172) and Appendix 3.1, which highlights Failure Pattern F where nearly 50% of failures occur within 20% of mean life. The hazard rate remains constant (or exponentially distributed) until week 100. Additionally, Appendix 3.2 demonstrates the impact of the shape factor on reliability. Another reviewer, Andy Hunt, emphasized the importance of including real-life examples to make the points more relevant. Hunt noted that the examples, such as the PMO 2000 showcase, only cover a few failure modes while potentially missing more common ones. The search continues for the reasons behind these omissions.</p>

If there are still people following this discussion, the paper can be accessed at the second URL. Before commenting on any perceived rights or wrongs, it's essential to clarify the purpose of this case study. It serves to demonstrate the core PMO2000 process and is not meant to be a flawless engineering solution. As an aeronautical engineer, I acknowledge that my expertise is limited to this field. While I can explain how task intervals are derived, I will not engage in debates over their accuracy. However, I am open to discussion on failure modes, RCM, and PMO2000 processes. It should be noted that the tasks presented in the study lack detail, as our company's standards require more thoroughness. This case study does not aim to showcase technical writing proficiency. If someone argues that PMO2000 overlooks maintenance tasks, they must provide evidence that an alternative process would have identified the missing task. These points should be considered before delving into further discussions.</p>

            <p>Steve, are you suggesting that the "PMO2000 program is risky because it may overlook important tasks, which RCM would not overlook"? I am not familiar enough with the PMO 2000 process to form an opinion on this. Your responses to my questions have hindered my attempts to understand it better, leading to doubts due to the lack of transparency. However, I am eager to learn more about it. I do not currently have a hypothesis and will not formulate one until I have a better grasp of the topic. In my opinion, setting preconditions for a debate may not be the most conducive approach to ensuring its success. Is this your goal?</p>

            <p>In considering the role of the fin fan in various processes, it is important to recognize the value of analytical processes such as PMO2000 and RCM. An analytical process like PMO2000 is effective because it can uncover relevant facts through systematic questioning, rather than relying solely on expert opinions from the client. Just as different approaches are used in root cause analysis (RCA) with the same data and personnel, the way we analyze tasks can lead to different insights. It is not sufficient to rely entirely on a group of experts; claims should be supported by a robust analytical process. Readers may be more familiar with RCM than PMO2000, but they can still compare your analysis and determine its validity. In discussions like these, it is important to challenge and question claims presented, rather than blindly accepting them. Ultimately, claims should be substantiated by the person making them, and challengers should approach with a critical mindset to draw informed conclusions.</p>

            <p>I will not be providing an RCM version at this time due to time constraints and the lack of necessity. Instead, I have shared a PMO2000 version. I challenge you to identify any instances where RCM would have recommended a different maintenance program compared to PMO2000, given the same asset and information set. The removal of people as a fixed element is acceptable, as doing so can improve the accuracy of hypothesis testing. The focus here is on proving the importance of the process rather than the group involved. Analytical processes excel at uncovering relevant facts through targeted questioning. The maintenance program for this asset is detailed and has been developed using the PMO2000 line of questioning. If utilizing standard RCM Decision logic, the solution typically centers around the failure mode set. In this case, all preventable and hidden failure modes have been identified, leading to a maintenance program that aligns with the same decision logic. Our goal is to demonstrate that every necessary maintenance task for this asset has been accounted for, based on the provided design and operating context.</p>

            <p>Quote: I am currently without a hypothesis, but I will not form one until I have a solid grasp on the subject of Vee. I find myself quite perplexed about the situation at hand. After I wrote a paper, you indicated that failure modes were not appropriately addressed in an example intended for another purpose. In response, I provided a comprehensive PMO2000 analysis for you to examine and provide feedback on the included and excluded failure modes. Can you kindly point out where my paper may be flawed? In my paper, I mentioned that PMO2000 will yield the same maintenance program as RCM - do you agree with this statement? Yes or no. If not, could you elaborate on your reasoning? GLT has stated that PMO2000 does not contribute to the current maintenance program – however, I believe this assertion to be incorrect. I am eager to engage in discussions in order to clarify my points and ensure that my message is clear, or to receive guidance on where my perspective may need adjustment.</p>

            <p>Steve, I agree with Vibe-rator. Without providing your RCM analysis, it is impossible for others to understand the functions due to the unique operating context, equipment drawings, performance standards, and P&I D's only known to you. It is unclear how you expect anyone else to verify the effectiveness of PMO 2000 without this information. Without it, we are simply going around in circles. It would have been helpful if you had filled in the missing failure modes in your fan example. However, it seems you are unwilling to do so. If you are seeking a debate, you may need to reconsider your position. Alternatively, if you agree with me, please start a new discussion thread. If not, I will no longer engage in this non-productive debate.</p>

            <p>Steve, I must address your tendency to misquote myself and others. It is important to accurately represent someone's words or statements, as misquoting can lead to misunderstandings. Let's take the recent example with Vibe-Rator. I did not quote them; I simply acknowledged that they were correct. When quoting sources, it is customary to use quotation marks or explicitly state that you are quoting. I make an effort to accurately reflect your statements by sharing my understanding and allowing you to clarify if needed. 

However, in the case of N&H, you added a key word to their statement and then claimed a significant revelation in a post. While you attributed this to your interpretation of English, it actually distorted the original meaning of N&H's statement. By inserting this word, you transformed their simple statement of respect for quality and humility into one that supposedly questioned the validity of RCM. In doing so, you overlooked the context that led to their statement, such as the need for a prior maintenance program for comparison. 

Ultimately, the key takeaway should have been the realization that your belief that RCM does not apply to existing equipment was incorrect. Instead of acknowledging this, you celebrated a 'discovery' of your own making. It is crucial to approach quotes and statements with care and integrity to avoid misrepresenting the original intent.</p>
