            <p>Are you still conducting routine maintenance on your equipment? Many companies have transitioned to Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) to ensure optimal performance. Extending the running period of equipment involves considering various factors. One important step is to review the previous overhaul and address any issues that may have arisen. Comparing vibration, temperature, and other collected data can help identify potential problems. Experience from both operations and maintenance staff is also key in determining when and how to extend the equipment's running period. If unsure, increasing the frequency of condition monitoring can provide added peace of mind. In truth, well-maintained equipment often exceeds manufacturers' recommended periods of use. It's important to remember the "bathtub" curve, as equipment failures are more likely to occur right after an overhaul.</p>

            <p>When it comes to equipment used in industries like refineries, such as pumps, turbines, and compressors, it's important to consider factors beyond just monitoring. Issues like wear in tracks, hydraulic hoses, and associated systems all play a role. Looking back at previous overhauls can help determine if they were truly necessary. As the owner or operator, you are the best person to make this judgement based on your experience and the current conditions of the equipment. It's crucial to assess if maintenance could have been postponed for longer periods of time.</p>

            <p>Hello Snap-Ring, do you go by another name? The mining equipment you mentioned is prone to various age-related failure modes. This includes wear, fatigue, erosion, and more, which are all influenced by factors like time-in-service and operation cycles. To prevent failure, it is important to conduct age-related preventive maintenance tasks. The vendor's recommended maintenance frequency may be overly cautious, as they may not fully understand your operational environment. It is advisable to stick to the existing routines and regularly inspect components to determine if maintenance was performed at the right time. Keeping records of the component's condition is crucial for determining the next maintenance schedule. You can consider stretching the maintenance intervals by 10-15%, such as extending from six months to 30 weeks. This process, known as age-exploration in RCM terminology, can be beneficial, especially if you have a fleet of equipment. Conducting a comprehensive RCM analysis may be justified for a fleet of equipment that is crucial to your operations, but may not be cost-effective for individual items.</p>
