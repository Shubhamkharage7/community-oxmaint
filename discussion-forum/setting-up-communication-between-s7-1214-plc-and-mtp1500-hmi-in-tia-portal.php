                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! I am currently working on two projects involving S7-1214 PLCs - "Project1" with an MTP1500 HMI and "Project2" with another S7-1214 PLC. Both PLCs require communication with the HMI, and I have successfully set up a connection in the HMI for Project1. However, I am uncertain about the setup for Project2. I have configured a new connection in the HMI for Project2 by entering the IP address of the PLC. Should I also make an additional connection in the Devices/Networks/Connection settings of the Project2 PLC, or is the connection already established? (Please disregard the S7 Connection as it is intentional.) Remember, proper communication setup is essential for seamless operation.</p>

            <p>To interact with the second PLC, you can either specify all settings manually using absolute addresses or designate it as a "proxy PLC." This feature allows for seamless integration and configuration. Visit SIOSsupport.industry.siemens.com for more information on PLC support.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jesper. I believe I have resolved the issue by duplicating the PLC within the smaller project. However, I encountered a message stating "No PLC found in project" when attempting to utilize device proxy. Can I still use PUT/GET within the same project to communicate between PLCs, or is there a more straightforward method available? My PUT/GET configuration is already set up â€“ can I keep it as is?</p>

            <p>swedeleaner mentioned that they were able to address the issue by mirroring the PLC in the smaller project, which is a common workaround in situations where suppliers are hesitant to share the entire PLC program or when different versions of TIA are being used. Moving forward in the same project, the question arose whether PUT/GET functionality would suffice for PLC to PLC communication or if there is a simpler method available. The PUT/GET configuration is already set up and can be left as is for now. It is important to note that the PLC performing the PUT/GET function must have an unspecified connection to the other PLC and should not establish a fully specified connection that requires data to be loaded onto the partner PLC. While BSEND/BRECV would be preferred, it is not compatible with the S7-1200 model.</p>

            <p>I want to thank Jesper for your assistance - it's greatly appreciated. I decided to go for the fully specified connection, regardless of whether I download to either of the PLCs. One is currently in mid-commissioning phase, while the other is still offline and waiting for programming to be loaded.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How do I set up communication between an S7-1214 PLC and an MTP1500 HMI in TIA Portal?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To set up communication between the S7-1214 PLC and MTP1500 HMI, you need to configure connections in both devices. Ensure you have the correct IP address entered in the HMI and establish a corresponding connection in the PLC's Devices/Networks/Connection settings.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. I have successfully set up a connection for Project1 between the S7-1214 PLC and the HMI. Do I need to create a new connection for Project2 in the HMI and PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Yes, for each project involving a different S7-1214 PLC, you will need to create a new connection in both the HMI and PLC. Enter the specific IP address of the PLC for Project2 in the HMI, and set up a corresponding connection in the PLC's network settings.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Is it necessary to establish a separate connection in the Devices/Networks/Connection settings of the Project2 PLC, even if a connection is configured in the HMI?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Yes, it is essential to create a connection in the Devices/Networks/Connection settings of the Project2 PLC, in addition to setting up the connection in the HMI. This ensures proper communication between the PLC and HMI for seamless operation of the system.</p>
