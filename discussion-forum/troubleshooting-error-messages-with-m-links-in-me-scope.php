                    <p>Attached are two screenshots showing an error message I encountered while trying to create M# links for animating my model in ME Scope. The message indicates that around 50 points were not assigned M#'s, causing issues with the animation.

I would greatly appreciate any assistance in resolving this issue. Thank you, KB.</p>

            <p>Looking back on those memories, I remember the important steps to animate a structure. Firstly, you need to either draw or import a model of the structure. Secondly, import measurement data into a Data Block file or a Shape Table file. Lastly, assign M#'s in the data block or shape table to the Degrees of Freedom (DOF) of the model, such as points and directions. Have you completed step 3? If you need assistance, feel free to reach out to Vibrant Technology Tech Support. Regards, Jim P.</p>

            <p>Hey Jim, I'm having some trouble with step 3 of my project. I'm attempting to create approximately 450 M# links, but when I run the animation equations, only around 150 are being generated and I'm getting an error message for the rest. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong, but I'll share the solution once I figure it out. Thanks, KB.</p>

            <p>After some investigation, I discovered that the issue causing my animations to not work properly was due to unassigned data in the data block. Once I fixed this and ran interpolation calculations for each substructure, the animations started working perfectly. I'm so pleased with how they look now. Grateful for the troubleshooting process. Thank you, KB.</p>

            <p>That's great to hear. Learning from mistakes is key to becoming "smarter." By consistently applying this principle, one can significantly improve their knowledge and skills. By the way, did the points or M#'s in question align with where the error code originated? J</p>

            <p>Hello Jim, I confirmed that the data matched. I previously modeled this installation in Clear Motion and now, with my ME Scope license, I only modeled part of it, resulting in more data than necessary. Importing this extra data, which didn't correspond to any points, triggered an error message. This was a valuable learning opportunity. ME Scope is a powerful software tool that I am grateful to have a license for now. Thank you and enjoy your weekend, KB.</p>

            <p>Edited by Kristan Sears on August 18, 2023 at 08:40. Hi Kyle, I just replied to your previous post regarding NI hardware. I am currently facing difficulties with ME'scope. I am using an accelerometer and hammer to gather data and trying to save it in a Data Block. I am utilizing channels 1-3 (0 - 2 on the NI card) of the NI-9234 for output channels, and channel 4 (3 on the NI card) for hammer input. While the acquisition process appears to be functioning properly, there are issues with the incremented DOF when saving it. Additionally, I am having trouble grasping how ME'scope interacts with the Data Block to store the acquired readings.</p>
