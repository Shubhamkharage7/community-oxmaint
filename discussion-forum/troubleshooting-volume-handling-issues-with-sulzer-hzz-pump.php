                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am facing challenges with my Sulzer HZZ pump. The pump seems unable to handle the vessel's volume as the level control valve is fully open while the level keeps rising. The pump was taken to the workshop for repairs, where it was disassembled and all clearances were found to be within specifications before being reassembled. After installation, a dead head test was conducted, showing a suction gauge pressure of 8 bar and a dead head discharge pressure of 35 bar, with a data sheet SG of .6. Any insights on this issue?</p>

            <p>Kindly share information regarding the installation process, including any details on whether it is a new or existing setup. Have you experienced any issues with the pump in the past? Are you certain that the valve is functioning properly? What is the inflow rate compared to the outflow rate on the suction side? Is the suction side operating under a vacuum or open to the atmosphere? What components are present on the suction and discharge sides? What type of fluid is being pumped, and are there any elevation changes to consider? Additionally, please provide information on the design conditions, flow discharge head, and if you have a copy of the pump curve available. Thank you.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is the level of the vessel rising even when the level control valve is fully open while using the Sulzer HZZ pump?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The rising level issue despite the fully open control valve could be due to the pump's inability to handle the vessel's volume efficiently.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What could be the possible reasons for the Sulzer HZZ pump's volume handling issues?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Possible reasons for the volume handling issues could include internal clearances not being within specifications, leading to inefficiencies in pump performance.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What was the outcome of the dead head test conducted on the Sulzer HZZ pump?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The dead head test results showed a suction gauge pressure of 8 bar and a dead head discharge pressure of 35 bar, with a data sheet SG of .6. This information can provide insights into the pump's performance under specific conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. How can one troubleshoot and address volume handling issues with the Sulzer HZZ pump?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Troubleshooting steps could involve checking for any discrepancies in the pump's internal clearances, ensuring proper assembly after repairs, and analyzing test results to identify potential causes of the volume handling problems.</p>
