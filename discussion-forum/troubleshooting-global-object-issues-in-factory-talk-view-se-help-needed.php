                    <p>Hello everyone, I have encountered an issue with our SCADA system after applying patches to some Rockwell Software. Despite thinking it was unrelated to FT View, I have noticed that restarting servers has caused some issues with Global Object calling. The Objects that fail to load appear to be random whenever I switch pages. Can anyone provide insight into what may be causing this and suggest a solution? Any advice based on personal experiences would be greatly appreciated as I work towards addressing this issue in the future. Thank you for your assistance!</p>

            <p>In response to Michoviz's comment, Lodd asked for advice on troubleshooting an error in the global object. Despite attempting to delete and copy it again, the issue persists and even affects new objects created. An error message is visible in the diagnostics viewer which may be connected to the problem. Lodd seeks guidance on how to resolve this error. Grateful for any assistance provided.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>This issue may occur if you rename or relocate any global object files or objects in global files. When you export the XML for a display that is affected, you will see instances of global objects with a specific attribute indicating the global object it is attempting to load: Code: linkBaseObject="GLOBAL_FILE_NAME.GLOBAL_OBJECT_NAME".</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Cheeseface explained that renaming or moving global object files can lead to issues like the one described. When exporting the XML for a display experiencing this problem, you may notice instances where global objects have a attribute specifying the object it is trying to load, such as: Code:linkBaseObject="GLOBAL_FILE_NAME.GLOBAL_OBJECT_NAME". We have examined the XML files and found no issues with the element mentioned. The problem seems to occur randomly, as sometimes the object loads correctly when revisiting the page, but after repeating the steps multiple times, it fails to load again. Different objects are affected each time this happens.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To address global object problems, start by backing up your project and closing all open displays. Next, if the global object file is labeled as GLOBAL_01, change its name to GLOBAL_02. Open GLOBAL_02, highlight all objects, and copy them. Then, create a fresh global file named GLOBAL_01, paste the objects, and save the file. Lastly, reopen your displays with instances and trigger a save by making a small edit and then undoing it. This process will help resolve any issues with global objects efficiently.</p>

            <p>If you have made any changes to the Global Object, you may encounter issues when grouping and ungrouping them. To resolve this, try closing all screens utilizing the object, then access the Global Object to regroup the items before reopening the screens.
