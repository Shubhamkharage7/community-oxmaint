                    <p>One of my clients uses Wonderware and FTView in different sections of their facility. They are looking to set up a backup PC that can be used with either system in case of a PC breakdown. While I understand the importance of addressing licensing and keeping both applications updated, my main concern is whether both software packages can coexist on the same PC without any interference. Can Wonderware and FTView be installed on the same computer seamlessly? Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>Perhaps this idea is too simplistic, but have you considered virtualizing each system in individual virtual machines (VMs) and then only running the necessary one on the backup PC when needed? This approach can streamline the process and ensure that resources are utilized efficiently.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Dravik, for your input. I appreciate hearing that. Hardware should not be a major concern for us, as we typically use robust hardware for our HMI systems to ensure that they remain efficient and up-to-date. Our HMIs are built to handle heavy hardware to keep up with advancements in technology. In our case, the apps won't be running simultaneously, so it's more of an either/or scenario.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your input, mort81. Virtualization is a feasible option that I had not previously explored, and although it should be effective, navigating Microsoft's licensing policy may present some challenges.</p>

            <p>Maximize the efficiency of your SCADA servers by virtualizing them and creating redundant backups in various locations. In the event of hardware failure, easily deploy the latest VM backup onto any new PC hardware. Say goodbye to installations and activations - simply duplicate the VM and start running with ease. This seamless process ensures minimal downtime and maximum uptime for your critical systems.</p>

            <p>I frequently create multiple versions of software to cater to different customer needs.

Similarly, a different machine operates on FactoryTalk View 6.1 and Wonderware 9.5 to meet specific requirements. This diverse setup ensures seamless support for all clients with varying software preferences.</p>

            <p>When it comes to simultaneously running WonderWare and FT View in a factory setting, my advice remains the same as I gave to my previous boss. I discovered a setup consisting of one WonderWare HMI, one FT View SE, and 15 FT View ME installations across 15 different models. The question that arises is: Why would you choose to complicate things in this manner?</p>
