            <p>Hello Josh, thank you for getting back to me. Let me provide you with a brief overview of my situation. I am responsible for inputting data on all the assets present on FPSO vessels used in oil and gas exploration and production. We utilize P&ID drawings to document these assets, which include a variety of valves such as manual, motor, and hydraulic operated ones. Additionally, there are numerous instruments like level gauges, indicators, transmitters, and controllers installed on the main equipment. If we were to register all these assets and upload them to a PM or Pdm program, would this result in a large number of work orders? Should we prioritize certain types of valves and instruments for inclusion in the PM instead? Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Albert.</p>

            <p>Effective analysis in the future relies heavily on the foundation of your CMMS platform. Although we utilize Maximo, the specific brand is not crucial. Our team is in favor of incorporating valves into our database, while others oppose this idea. After ten years of utilizing a database without valves, we have realized the importance of having them for identifying problematic units when workorders are composed at the valve level. It is essential to attach spare parts to equipment for easy access to information on which spares are needed for each valve, especially in the event of recalls or turn-arounds. Despite the initial cost of database space, the long-term benefits of having comprehensive equipment information far outweigh the expenses. Failing to input this data now may result in inefficient workarounds becoming ingrained in your organization's culture. It is crucial to establish proper guidelines for workorder generation to maximize the value of historical data extracted from the database. Take action now to ensure that your data history will be a valuable asset in the future.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback, Wally. I acknowledge your perspective on inputting data into the CMMS. It is important to establish criteria for which equipment should be included in the system. For example, in your facility, there may be numerous 1/4" size valves. Should these be documented in the CMMS? Also, what criteria should we use to determine which equipment gets entered into the CMMS? - Albert</p>

            <p>When determining whether an item should be classified as an asset, it's important to establish clear criteria. For instance, a small gate valve may not be considered an asset on its own, but it could be more beneficial to categorize the entire piping branch as one. Setting a price threshold, such as anything over $500, can help streamline the system. It's crucial to clearly define what constitutes a "maintenance asset" in terms of functionality, maintenance requirements, and necessary resources to avoid any confusion. These definitions should be established concurrently to prevent any potential errors, such as mistakenly including a director's chair or an expensive spare shaft as assets in the equipment inventory.</p>

            <p>When discussing work orders (CM, PM, PdM, etc.), Josh is emphasizing the importance of grouping them based on work type. It is crucial to establish a detailed hierarchy that allows for work orders to be assigned to equipment for effective failure tracking. Ensure that each piece of equipment is broken down to the lowest repairable unit (LRU) that is relevant. Consider assigning equipment numbers to piping branches or sub-systems for easier tracking purposes. The key is to create a hierarchy that enables work orders to be linked closely to the equipment being monitored for future analysis. Don't forget to correctly allocate spare parts and quantities to your equipment from the start, as this will be beneficial in the long run. Like Steve mentioned, setting rules and standardizing processes upfront is essential to prevent data from getting lost in a system with years of information. Implement guidelines for work order entry to prevent them from being written too high in the hierarchy. Writing work orders at a high level will only result in unnecessary work during later analysis when determining the cause of a failure.</p>

            <p>How valves and instruments are included in the PM or PdM program of an organization varies depending on the extent of control valves being integrated into the Equipment Master List. These valves contain both a valve and control part (electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, electronic, hydraulic) that requires periodic maintenance checks. Typically, control valves are already identified on P&IDs, PFDs, or schematic drawings, especially if they are part of a piping, cooling, or pumping system. Maintenance on valves, especially the simpler ones, involves tasks like replacing packing every two years during shutdowns or turnarounds. Grouping valves within a system can streamline the maintenance process and prevent the need for numerous separate work orders. PdM techniques, such as ultrasound scans, infrared surveys, and continuous monitoring of process variables, can help detect valve leakage. When designing asset hierarchies, it's essential to consider systems as a whole rather than focusing solely on individual components.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering what items to include in an asset register, there are multiple perspectives to consider. From a financial standpoint, the asset register is essential for calculating the book value of the plant assets, determining insurance premiums, and assessing the overall value of the company. On the other hand, maintenance teams rely on the asset register to track work orders and evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance activities.

Assets can vary widely, ranging from concrete foundations to core plant equipment. There isn't a set rule for what should be included in the asset register - it ultimately depends on what is deemed valuable to the plant's operations. For example, a maintenance crew's pickup truck may be considered a main asset for a freight moving company, but not for an oil and gas plant.

To avoid confusion and ensure accurate data collection, it's important to collaboratively define what constitutes an asset with the client. While some items like valves may seem insignificant, their inclusion in the asset register should be determined based on their critical function within the system and their impact on business operations if they were to fail.

Ultimately, decisions regarding asset inclusion should align with the plant's maintenance strategy matrix and consider the consequences of equipment failure. Having spare valves on hand for emergencies is also crucial in maintaining business continuity and guiding the selection of preventive maintenance or predictive maintenance programs.</p>

            <p>Hello Svanels, thank you for sharing your insights. I am in alignment with the five key points you raised. When it comes to efficiency, organizing work orders into groups can be extremely beneficial. Why create 300 individual work orders for 100 meters of piping when they can be grouped together? Perhaps a more streamlined approach could be grouping valves and instruments under the equipment being used as the name for the work order. Do you think this method is viable? Thank you, Albert.</p>

            <p>Hello KJAP, thank you for sharing your valuable insights. In this discussion, I am specifically focusing on the importance of maintaining an 'asset register' for the maintenance department. As you rightly pointed out, the decision to register assets varies from organization to organization, depending on their specific needs and maintenance strategies. Our conversation highlights how crucial it is to have a comprehensive 'maintenance asset register' in place to facilitate an efficient maintenance program. Utilizing CMMS software plays a significant role in this process, as the quality of data input directly impacts its effectiveness. It is essential for maintenance professionals to understand the significance of accurate data entry and actively participate in building and maintaining the asset register. I appreciate everyone's contributions to this discussion. Thank you, Albert.</p>

            <p>Ensuring data entry accuracy is crucial, as even small typos can cause discrepancies in databases. In our CMMS, we have encountered numerous instances where errors stemmed from inaccurate data input, including equipment names, spare parts, and location details. Databases operate in a literal way, making it essential to review entries against the original list. This step is particularly important during new installations to prevent future issues. Prioritizing data entry accuracy will yield long-term benefits.</p>

            <p>Is it practical to organize valves and instruments by grouping them under the equipment name on the work order? It depends. If the instrument is integrated into the equipment, such as a pressure sensor that was designed and supplied with the equipment and is unique, then go ahead. However, if the instrument (such as a control valve or thermowell) could be a different brand or type, it should be recorded as an asset. Use the P&ID as a reference for guidance. Start categorizing your equipment into groups such as shell-tube heat exchangers, air-cooled heat exchangers, centrifugal pumps, positive displacement pumps, and control valves based on common specifications.</p>

            <p>Hello Albert, your question is a valid one and some helpful guidelines have already been shared. Drawing from our experience, here are some additional tips for creating successful preventive maintenance plans in CMMS:

1. Ensure that all PM plans are drafted and approved by the relevant engineer (maintenance/technical support) before implementation in CMMS. Designated CMMS coordinators at each site should be responsible for creating PM tasks in the system. Consider linking related entities (such as group valves and instruments) in a single PM job for efficiency.

2. Include Motor Operated Valves (MOV) and Relief Valves in your PM schedule.

3. Also, add some butterfly, gate, globe, and check valves to your PM routine.

4. Don't forget about important instruments like transmitters, switches, gauges, analyzers, and sensors when planning PM tasks.

5. While we generally do not use Predictive Maintenance (PDM) for valves and instruments, we do conduct checks using IR guns before scheduled maintenance to ensure proper functioning.

We hope these suggestions prove beneficial to you in your maintenance planning endeavors.</p>

            <p>Hello Ganesh, thank you for sharing your insights. After reviewing all the responses in this conversation, I am now convinced that valves and instruments should be integrated into any preventive maintenance program. It is crucial to systematically identify these assets and configure our CMMS to effectively manage the necessary work. 

Moving forward, my inquiry pertains to the execution of job plans and work orders involving valves and instruments. Are there potential challenges that may arise during the completion of these tasks? Considering that we will be grouping valves and instruments together, the labor hours required for implementing job plans could be affected. Therefore, careful planning is essential to ensure smooth execution. 

Kind regards,
Albert.</p>

            <p>Dear Albert,

Taking on a massive task can be daunting, but with a systematic approach, it is definitely achievable. To assist you in this endeavor, I have attached a sample Project Management (PM) form commonly used in Saudi Arabia. By extracting the necessary information from this form and inputting it into an Excel spreadsheet or an Access database, you can streamline the approval process for large-scale projects.

Regarding the concept of grouping, it is essential to consider how entities are organized within a PM job. When grouping entities in a logical manner (PM Master data), such as grouping PM Work Orders or Work Order Tasks triggered by a CMMS, it can be beneficial. However, if you intend to cluster multiple entities into one entity, it presents a different challenge.

To illustrate this, let's consider a scenario where manual isolation valves were grouped together due to a lack of tag numbers in the past. This led to complications in tracking history and analyzing failures once the data was migrated to CMMS. This example highlights the importance of defining equipment parameters and database rules upfront to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

This discussion on valves and instruments serves as a reminder to apply similar principles to other entity types such as switchgear, motor control centers, control panels, piping, and lighting. By determining what constitutes as "equipment" for your installation and establishing standardized database rules early on, you can effectively manage data within your CMMS system.

Best regards,

            <p>Hello Ganesh, I completely agree with your statement that data consistency is just as crucial as data accuracy, if not more so. The success of grouping entities relies heavily on both the planner and the efficiency of the CMMS. As you mentioned, it is essential for this process to be systematic. In our efforts to achieve data consistency in our work, we implemented the following strategies: 
1. We utilized P&ID, Electrical, and Communication diagrams to identify each physical asset with a unique tag number.
2. Only valves with sizes 2" and above were registered, excluding spectacle blinds, hose connections, and any spare parts or stock items.
3. All electrical equipment and instruments with tag numbers were registered, such as hand switches, alarms, batteries, HMIs, and other communication items. 
Thank you, Albert.</p>

            <p>Valve entry discussions are common in many companies - the decision to enter them upfront or not can impact maintenance processes in the future. By entering all valve types early on, change control tracking can be efficiently managed through a CMMS database. However, not doing so may lead to challenges later on, such as the inability to accurately track valve changes and actuator counts. 

In a recent scenario, a plant faced contamination issues and had to replace numerous gaskets and diaphragms without a proper database or spreadsheet to guide them. This highlighted the importance of detailed job plans with valve P&ID numbers and replacement parts listed separately. 

Utilizing tools like Mobile Maximo can greatly improve maintenance tracking and make data retrieval easier, especially in critical situations like when valve actuators or switchpacks start failing unexpectedly. Having valves integrated into Maximo can streamline data management and prevent potential risks in the long run. Donâ€™t sacrifice long-term efficiency for short-term convenience - investing time in data entry upfront can save you from costly issues down the line.</p>

            <p>Hello Albert, starting with P&ID (Process and Instrumentation Diagrams) or PFDs (Process Flow Diagrams), as well as Electrical Schematic/Layout Diagrams, can be valuable initial resources. However, it's important to note that these resources may vary in terms of level of detail. For example, do the electrical diagrams at your site clearly identify tags for each lighting fixture? In our CMMS, we have consolidated all 'normal 120/240 V ac lighting' within one entity for a specific area, building, or structure. However, the normal 120/240V ac lighting panels in the same area are treated as separate entities in CMMS due to unique tag numbers assigned to each panel. 

Are you considering implementing an electronic Work Permit and Clearance Management System (WPMS) in the future? From our experience, it was relatively simple to transfer data on manual isolation valves, including their descriptions and tag numbers, from the CMMS entity database to the WPMS database when these details were available in the CMMS. I resonate with Wally on two points: firstly, not creating a detailed database now could result in it never being developed, and secondly, investing in database space is more cost-effective than dealing with historical data retrieval down the line. However, it is crucial to ensure that the CMMS entity screens do not become overloaded with numerous equipment items (such as valves, instruments, lighting fixtures, MCC feeders, hangers, etc.) under one system/sub-system.</p>

            <p>Dear Albert,

A work permit is a crucial document that grants permission to a qualified individual to carry out maintenance work on equipment or facilities in a restricted area. On the other hand, clearance is the formal authorization given to a qualified person to work on operational equipment or facilities that are too hazardous to work on while in use. These tasks involve isolating and deactivating the equipment in a specified manner to ensure a safe working environment.

The use of tag-out, lock-out, and permit-to-work procedures is common in these situations. Currently, we are utilizing electronic Work Permit Management Systems (WPMS) at two of our sites. This system not only generates tags, permits, and clearances but also streamlines the entire process. However, we are facing challenges with the lack of integration between our Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and WPMS. Currently, only basic work order information is transferred from CMMS to WPMS on a daily or weekly basis.

We are exploring the possibility of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system like SAP-PM with Work Clearance Management (WCM) to seamlessly integrate maintenance management with work clearance management. This integration would greatly improve efficiency and effectiveness in our operations.

I wanted to address the importance of safety when it comes to valve operations. It is essential to evaluate the criticality of each valve, considering its impact on safety and the environment. Valves that serve as a last line of defense are crucial for preventive maintenance (PM) and predictive maintenance (PdM) efforts.

            <p>Recently, I received a notification regarding the obsolescence of a steam back pressure regulator valve model as of 1/1/09. Fortunately, I was able to easily locate several valves and spare parts with the correct model number entered. However, there were instances where valves had been entered without a model number, leading to a time-consuming process of connecting the dots by searching for the manufacturer name and then verifying the model number in the field. This resulted in a significant waste of untracked man-hours across various departments. It is crucial to enter all necessary information into the CMMS system at the start to prevent such inefficiencies.

Finding valves that were not initially entered into the CMMS system has been a challenge, as I do not have access to the P&ID catalog or the original turnover lists. Resorting to digging up hard copy lists from the archives has proven to be unreliable, as these lists were not always updated for change control purposes. Had the CMMS been properly populated, change control for current model numbers could have been effectively managed.

When it comes to safety recalls, having obsolete parts can pose a serious risk. Neglecting to input available data into the CMMS system is a significant contributing factor to potential failures in the future. It is essential to prioritize accurate and thorough data entry to prevent any hidden failures from occurring.</p>

I wanted to inform you that we have begun the process of labeling all manual isolation valves and check valves at an older plant. The original P&IDs did not include unique tag numbers for these equipment, so we are updating the CMMS with relevant entity data. While this effort is time consuming, the management has been supportive throughout. We are close to finishing this task now.</p>
