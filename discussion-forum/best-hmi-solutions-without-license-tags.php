Ignition is known for being one of the most powerful and reliable historians compared to Aveva or FactoryTalk. However, for a single HMI requirement, Ignition may be considered excessive. Perhaps you meant to consider Edge instead?</p>

            <p>I am not sure which historian you have utilized for your ignition system, but the last time I tested its performance was on version 8.1, and it encountered significant difficulties when handling extensive data loads. As a result, I had to create a custom postgres historian with timescale and develop a SQL interface to mimic the way ignition interacted with the database. Unlike FactoryTalk historian, which is essentially PI, AVEVA historian stands out as a highly efficient option with exceptional performance and data storage capabilities. Additionally, Canary is well-suited for high-speed data processing.</p>

            <p>In a discussion about historians, a user shared their experience with different systems. While some have had issues with Ignition's historian in the past, others have found it to be reliable when integrated properly. The FactoryTalk historian, similar to PI, is praised for its superior performance and data storage capabilities. AVEVA's historian is highly regarded, and Canary is known for handling high-speed data effectively.
Although some users appreciate FT, AVEVA, and Canary for their data recording capabilities, they find their integration features lacking. FT is considered expensive, AVEVA is seen as struggling, and Canary is not seen as a fully integrated platform.</p>

            <p>Robertmee expressed surprise at experiencing no issues during various factory rollouts that were integrated for local visualization across division MES. Ignition provides the flexibility to customize the underlying database architecture, suggesting that any problems may have stemmed from the setup rather than Ignition itself. Utilizing standalone MSSQL servers, the system was able to handle querying 30,000 tags per second without any issues.

While acknowledging the merits of FT, Aveva, and Canary in terms of time server historian capabilities, the integration beyond data recording was deemed lacking and cumbersome. FT was considered expensive, Aveva's future seemed uncertain, and Canary was criticized for not being an integrated platform.

The projects Robertmee worked on with Ignition typically had a minimum of 150k tags, often ranging from 250k to 500k tags. Ignition was found to perform well on embedded computers as a standalone HMI, and there may now be a free tier available for such installations, although specific details were not recalled.</p>

            <p>tlf30 mentioned that the ignition work they have experience with typically involves systems with a minimum of 150k tags, ranging up to 250k to 500k tags. Ignition performs well on embedded computers as a standalone Human-Machine Interface (HMI), with a new free tier available for such installations. The 30k query size per second was mentioned, but querying 500k tags per second would be impressive. If you are struggling with storing and retrieving 200k tags every second, it may be due to incorrect setup of Ignition scan classes or deadbands.</p>

Ultimately, it comes down to individual experiences and preferences in the world of industrial automation software.</p>
