            <p>It is important to understand that control power and line power are two separate aspects. In a recent occurrence, a circuit breaker tripped and maintenance mistakenly believed the drive had failed. However, simply resetting the circuit breaker resolved the issue. It is crucial to ensure all power sources are functioning properly to avoid unnecessary expenses.</p>

            <p>In the realm of electrical systems, it's crucial to understand the distinction between control power and line power. An incident comes to mind where a circuit breaker tripped, leading maintenance to believe the drive had malfunctioned. However, simply resetting the breaker resolved the issue, prompting the realization that control power was at play. In this scenario, the LCD display and LEDs are driven by control power, while line power fuels the motor derivative power. This setup is typical in 6500 and 5700 common bus racks, but the configuration for the 5500 remains uncertain. Understanding the nuances of power distribution can prevent unnecessary expenses and downtime.</p>

            <p>The K5300-K5500 models feature individual 24vdc control power, unlike other models that rely on line power for operation. Control power and line power are distinct components, and if either fails, the system will not function properly. When the control power is functioning, the control module will display blinking lights. In such cases, the control module may be damaged and should be inspected for further assessment.</p>

            <p>padees mentioned that the K5300-K5500 models have individual 24vdc control power, unlike other models that rely on line power. It's important to note that control power and line power are two separate entities, and if one fails, the other is not affected. If the control power is functioning properly, the control module's lights will blink. It's possible that the control module may be defective in this scenario, but it's worth investigating further.

All rack-based 6500 and 5700 models also feature separate 24v power for module control. In these systems, the LCDs are powered by the control power. Based on the images provided by the original poster, the fact that the LCD is illuminated suggests that the control power is operational, assuming they share the same module architecture as the 5700/6500 models. However, it is still advisable to check both incoming powers, as I recommended in my initial posts. I hope the original poster has confirmed that both power sources are functioning correctly.</p>

            <p>These two drives are equipped with red STO physical input plugs, indicating they are likely utilizing standard Safe Torque Off rather than CIP Safety. In the first picture, the LCD displays are visible but the backlight is currently off. The drives automatically turn off the backlight after a certain period of time, but you can easily reactivate it by pressing the leftmost button. The MOD and LED lights were likely in between flashes at the time the photo was taken.

In the second photo, the screens display the information: STANDBY 192.168.5.104 DC Bus 325.4V and CONNECTING 192.168.5.103 DC BUS 295.4V. This suggests that both logic power and AC mains power are active, pointing to a possible issue with the logical or network connection to a Logix-family controller. However, without further context or detail other than a plea for assistance, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact problem.

The discrepancy in DC bus voltages raises the possibility that one of the drives may be experiencing "single phasing" with a blown input fuse. STANDBY and CONNECTING represent different phases of the CIP connection process, indicating a potential identity mismatch, network issue, or other logic-related problems.

            <p>Ken Roach mentioned that these two drives are equipped with red STO physical input plugs, indicating they are likely using standard Safe Torque Off instead of CIP Safety. Upon closer inspection of the first picture, one can observe that the LCD displays are active but the backlight is turned off. The drives automatically turn off the backlight after a certain period, but it can be reactivated by pressing the leftmost button. The MOD and LED lights appeared to be in a transitional phase when the photo was taken.

In the second photo, the screens display information such as STANDBY 192.168.5.104 DC Bus 325.4V and CONNECTING 192.168.5.103 DC Bus 295.4V, indicating that both logical power and AC mains power are functioning, with a possible issue related to the connection to a Logix-family controller. However, the lack of additional context beyond a simple request for help makes troubleshooting challenging.

The discrepancy in DC bus voltages raises the possibility of one of the drives experiencing "single phasing" with a blown input fuse. The statuses STANDBY and CONNECTING represent different phases of the CIP connection process, suggesting a potential identity mismatch or network-related problem. As a member of the PLCTalk forum community, Roodly is encouraged to provide more detailed information about the issue for comprehensive assistance.

In a follow-up comment, Ken noted that the MOD and NET lights remain off permanently, raising suspicions of a drive failure, particularly if control power drives the functionality of these lights. The discrepancy between the operational status of the LCD and LED lights hints at a potential internal malfunction within the drive.</p>
