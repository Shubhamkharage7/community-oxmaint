                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>After extensive research, I came across a fascinating discussion from 2008 on animating pipes. It seems that opinions were divided on the matter, leading to a heated debate. Personally, I believe that pipe animation may not be the most effective method as the system should provide clear warnings, interconnected signals, and textual updates on the process or plant's status. Displaying phase names and steps can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the overall situation. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this topic and whether there are any established standards on the use of pipe animation. Does anyone have additional insights or expertise in this area?</p>

            <p>Examples of these dynamic 'pipe animations' and 'phase steps' may refer to visual indicators on air and fluid pipes to show whether they are 'active' or 'inactive' through color animations. Some argue against the use of pipe animations, favoring alarming systems, interlocking indications, and textual displays to indicate the plant process's status. However, in my experience, operators find purely text-based information challenging to interpret. Many operators prefer a few simple graphical indicators, with emphasis on simplicity and clarity. Colors such as grey for inactive, bright green for active, yellow for warning, and red for faulted are commonly used to convey information efficiently. In our system, only grey and green colors are used for pipe animations to ensure clarity and simplicity.</p>

            <p>While I was not focusing on pipe animations, I realized the power of storytelling. A client raised concerns about an excessive display of decimal places on the screen, leading to confusion among system operators. To address this issue, I tweaked the HMI program to allow users to customize the number of decimal places. However, I received a call reporting a frozen HMI, which was actually caused by users reducing the decimal places to the point where values appeared static. This experience taught me the importance of having dynamic elements on the screen, such as a clock or a simple pipe animation, to indicate activity. Perhaps we should consider applying the Glasgow Coma Scale concept to HMIs to ensure their vitality and responsiveness.</p>

            <p>After reviewing cardosocea's post, I am beginning to understand that he may be referring to a progress bar animation for sequences. Currently, I have a text-based sequence status indicator that changes color depending on the overall state. However, I have encountered some issues with this approach. When the sequence increments quickly, the text blurs, becoming more of a distraction than a help. Conversely, when the sequence increments slowly, the operator may mistakenly believe the process is frozen. To address this, I have included the process value within the text, such as "Step 5. Heating. Actual=91.5°C, Set=120.0°C," or "Step 6. Mixing. Actual=30.2sec, Set=100.0sec," to provide real-time updates to the operator.

Considering these challenges, I am contemplating switching to a more straightforward progress bar system. Creating the text can be labor-intensive, especially for OEMs producing programs in multiple languages, and its value to the operator is questionable. What the operator truly needs to know is whether the machine or process is running (yes/no) and, if not, why it isn't running. In the event of an error, a detailed error message should be provided to explain the issue thoroughly. This topic is one that sparks opinions and discussions among many individuals.</p>

            <p>The latest ISA high performance HMI standards discourage the use of pipe animations as they are deemed too distracting. A well-designed process screen should remain predominantly static, with movement and color used only to highlight adverse conditions. Many individuals initially resist this approach, as did I. However, after implementing a few screens and breaking away from the traditional design paradigm, both myself and operators have come to appreciate the value of these guidelines.</p>

            <p>I concur with robertmee that animations, particularly pipe animation, can sometimes be distracting, but they can also be beneficial in certain situations. I have chosen not to use animations in some of my water treatment facility projects where the flow is straightforward. In these cases, valve and pump indicators suffice. However, I have recommended and implemented animations in a protein manufacturing plant with numerous intricate paths, over 100 valves, and CIP processes. This visual aid helped operators quickly and clearly see the path and its current state.
Before incorporating animations, consider whether they truly add value, if that value justifies their placement on a main or auxiliary screen, and most importantly, get feedback from the operators themselves. I suggest creating mock-ups of both options and gathering input from them. This approach can help determine the most effective solution for your specific situation.
@robetmee - I'm interested in the ISA publication number for my own reference. Thank you!</p>

            <p>I also concur that creating pipe animations can be time-consuming. Although it may not always be noticed, in one instance I worked on a project for a large manufacturing system where the client specifically requested it. I have to admit, the animation looked quite impressive as it visually depicted the process flow, whether it be product or CIP (brown & pink). The operators found it particularly useful as they could easily see the progress of the processes and where they were located within the system. Additionally, there were text fields providing more detailed information on the processes. 

However, one concern arose when a customer saw a demonstration of a system (Wonderware) by a representative, which showcased 3D rendering of pipework and valves with animated movements. The customer expressed interest in having similar animations but ultimately decided against it upon learning about the additional development costs.</p>

            <p>JesperMP mentioned the use of 'pipe animations' and 'phase steps' in industrial processes, specifically in process plants like chemicals. These animations involve indicating the flow of fluid through pipes with color changes to show if the pipe is 'sending' or 'not sending'. This method, although visually appealing, may not provide substantial value and can be challenging to engineer.

In terms of phases, referring to the ISA88 definition, it is important to display the status of phases such as Running, Starting, and Hold, along with step numbers and descriptions to indicate the sequence of events. Simple graphical indicators are often preferred in such scenarios, focusing on clarity and minimalism.

While some argue against the use of pipe animations due to potential distractions, others have found value in incorporating such visual elements. In a case study involving the installation of a system with multiple reactors, the decision to minimize animated elements was initially met with resistance. However, streamlining the interface based on operator feedback led to a more efficient system where animated pipes were deemed unnecessary.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of animations in industrial settings depends on the specific requirements of the process and the feedback from operators. Finding a balance between visual cues and practicality is key to enhancing the user experience without unnecessary complexities.</p>

            <p>I specialize in creating dynamic pump and valve animations, including animations for vibrators. While my focus has primarily been on valve animations, I also dabbled in a unique cooling pipe animation for a tank, transitioning from grey when off to light blue when on. Some may even consider my valve animations showcasing flow to be a form of pipe animation.</p>

            <p>I previously utilized 3-way valves in a system, a decision influenced by their presence in the process lines. These valves, which can be confusing due to their non-traditional open/close status, presented challenges in displaying their status clearly. The system required an interface that could be easily glanced at by operators who were not constantly monitoring it. To address this, I incorporated green flashing arrows in the active pipeline, a simple and efficient solution that ended up looking sleek and required less time than expected.</p>

            <p>Two or three-way valves are simple to understand. Our standard design consisted of a square box for the input feed and either two triangles or three for indicating the direction. In our system, grey indicated a non-energized state, green meant open or a specific direction, and flashing green/white indicated movement. Conversely, flashing red/yellow signaled a fault. 

During a project involving an experimental soup system, I worked with a programmer who added boxes to display additions. These boxes were simple squares with a white border, flashing red/orange when out of tolerance, and green when correct. However, I found the design unappealing and removed them when rewriting the code for a new PLC. Instead, I chose to convey information through text colors, like flashing red/orange for errors and white for successful additions. 

Unfortunately, I never had the chance to finalize the software as the company I worked for went out of business. A colleague who commissioned the system informed me that operators preferred the original box design, despite my belief that colored text messages were just as effective.</p>

It is important to prioritize operator input for optimal results. It is recommended to adhere to the High Performance standard previously mentioned. Avoid using animations of valves, spinning pumps, and fluid flow in pipes as they can be distracting.

            <p>When striving for high performance UX design, it is recommended to avoid specific colors and minimize the use of animations. However, this does not mean animations should be completely eliminated. In my designs, I utilize dark grey for inactive elements and bright green for active elements to accommodate those with color blindness. For errors, I use flashing black/red, which is still visible to color blind individuals. I follow the principle of green=good and red=bad, which is crucial for clear communication. While the valve animation from @I_Automation is visually appealing, it may be overly intricate for practical use.</p>

I always make a point to ask production operators about checking for color blindness, as it can have a significant impact on their work. If met with resistance, I recommend using tools like Coblis — Color Blindness Simulator by Colblindor to illustrate potential issues. The difference in perception can be quite striking at times.</p>

            <p>Using a single color for pipe animations to depict process flow is a strong choice that ensures clarity. Consider opting for a color like 'magenta' to represent this flow consistently throughout. Incorporating multiple colors can potentially be overwhelming and may pose difficulties for individuals with color blindness. Avoid using red and green together as they can be especially challenging for this demographic.</p>

            <p>JesperMP highlighted the importance of following high-performance standards, which recommend avoiding certain colors and limiting animations. However, this does not mean completely eliminating animations. To tackle color blindness, using dark grey for inactive elements and bright green for active ones, as well as flashing black/red for errors, can ensure visibility for color blind individuals. The association of green with good and red with bad may need to be reconsidered, as it can lead to eye strain over time. The ISA standard permits the use of red flashing indicators for critical alarms, with the flashing aspect being more attention-grabbing than the color red. Substituting white for green can enhance the contrast in grey/white examples, preventing confusion for color blind individuals. While resistant to change at first, adopting a muted palette in accordance with high performance standards can improve the overall professional appearance of a product.</p>

            <p>We only indicate the presence of a real alarm for a device with the color red. During normal operation, there will be no red color displayed. To ensure visibility, I opt for a very bright green color for the 'active' state. I question the idea that certain colors can cause eye strain while white does not. If industry standards recommend a change, I would be willing to reconsider my approach. My HMIs are designed to exude a sense of tranquility. Upon observing cockpit designs in both Boeing and Airbus aircraft, I noticed a variety of colored lamps, with green typically used for normal active states instead of white. It appears that these manufacturers may not be following the same high performance standard. (Note: Edited for spelling)</p>

            <p>During my past experience, I successfully programmed a biogas plant within an organic waste processing facility. The existing infrastructure included multiple conveyors to transport materials between stacks, with interactive arrows on the HMI indicating material flow direction. When tasked with implementing a similar HMI for the biogas plant, I designed moving arrows on each pipe, shifting 1 pixel every 100 ms to showcase the flow direction. These arrows only appeared when the pump was operational and the corresponding valves were open, creating a visually appealing display using Intouch HMI software. The intuitive nature of Intouch made the animation seamless, automatically adjusting to changes in orientation without any extra effort.

I vividly remember dedicating significant time to creating a realistic illusion of the arrows seamlessly moving across the screen, disappearing underneath equipment such as pumps and containers. This level of detail in animation was a unique challenge I thoroughly enjoyed tackling. Incorporating colored pipes based on media flow is a common practice in Germany, particularly within waste water plants where specific color-coding standards are followed. By using muted colors for media flow, any display errors or important alerts stand out prominently against the background, ensuring they capture the operator's attention instantly.</p>

            <p>Robertmee shared that initially, he was hesitant to change his usual design style, but after experimenting with a few high-performance (HP) projects, he grew to appreciate the muted palette. The subdued colors not only make the design easier on the eyes but also give a more professional appearance to the final product. 

In a linked PDF, it was highlighted how creators often take pride in their work, whether it's a simple menu or a complex Human Machine Interface (HMI). However, without proper education or training, individuals may struggle to assess their work against established standards. Receiving feedback and acknowledging one's mistakes is crucial for growth and improvement in any field.

JesperMP questioned the notion that colors can cause eye strain, noting that aircraft cockpits often use a variety of colored lamps with green being a common choice for normal operation. The use of muted colors, rather than stark white, may improve visibility in certain situations, such as in PlantPAX icons where low contrast can hinder readability.

Thomas_v2 mentioned his experience with a specific type of animation, finding that it made it easier to monitor processes from a distance on the screen. As automation increases, operators rely more on SCADA systems to oversee operations, with animated visuals providing quick insights into the current status of processes.</p>

            <p>Incorporating simple pipe animations in a single color, such as magenta, can effectively represent process flow without overwhelming viewers with various colors that may not be ideal for color-blind individuals. An alternative suggestion is to color pipes differently based on their usage (blue for used, gray for unused) to aid operators in easily identifying paths, especially in scenarios like pneumatic conveying of bulk solids. This approach allows operators to quickly pinpoint issues, such as diverter malfunctions, without relying heavily on HMI interfaces. Highlighted piping serves as a visual confirmation for operators drawing materials from the correct source, eliminating confusion and streamlining operations.

While animated pipes may seem engaging, they can be distractive for operators multitasking on the plant floor. Streamlining lean manufacturing processes is crucial, but excessively complex visual elements can hinder efficiency. Contrarily, in building automation systems, simplicity often trumps aesthetics, as maintenance and facility managers prioritize functionality over visual appeal. Instead of flashy animations, what matters most is quickly identifying faults and promptly addressing them to ensure seamless operations.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea mentioned the absence of a P&ID for the aircraft's hydraulic system, which would typically include animated lines. This aligns with my belief about HMIs. When driving a car, you don't see a detailed picture of the engine with moving parts; instead, there are large gauges that provide essential information, along with lights and alerts for malfunctions. Similarly, traditional airplane dashboards feature numerous dials and indicators, rather than a simplified depiction of the aircraft's components.

In my work at a water treatment plant, the example of tank level monitoring is relevant. Simply displaying the level in a textbox is not very helpful unless the operator can interpret the data accurately. High performance HMIs, in my view, excel in presenting information through trends and slider indicators, enabling operators to make informed decisions based on the process status rather than just raw data.

I also appreciate old-school control walls for the same reasons, which might make me a bit unconventional in my preferences.</p>

By designing screens that focus on trends and slider indicators, operators can gain insights into processes beyond just raw data. This approach reduces the need for operators to navigate through multiple screens to view trends and alarm limits.

During my time at a company in 2008, I was exposed to the meticulous attention given to high-performance graphics. The company invested in psychologists to determine the best color schemes, including the most relaxing shade of blue for the walls. One innovative feature on their dashboard was the levelling button, which centered all values once the steady state was reached. This simplified the monitoring process, with alarm limits displayed in different colors for easy assessment of value direction.

Despite the thorough training provided, few operators utilized the levelling button. Instead, they were required to manually record readings every 5 minutes on paper. This emphasizes the challenge of implementing new technology in traditional working environments.</p>

            <p>While I acknowledge the merit of the ISA101 standard, I don't strictly adhere to it as the ultimate authority in designing HMIs. I believe that considering the specific context is crucial, especially in industries where operators have limited interaction with SCADA monitors. While ISA101 excels in large-scale processes with dedicated operators, I find that certain aspects of the standard, such as analog indicator bars, are universally beneficial.

In my experience, designing screens hierarchically is more intuitive for users and streamlines development time by aligning with PLC structures. However, some HMIs, like C-More, present challenges with pop-up updates that may require separate screens to maintain hierarchy integrity.

When it comes to color usage, I diverge from ISA101 guidelines to suit the needs of operators who require quick, easily distinguishable information in fast-paced environments. I opt for muted colors that are still visible under varying lighting conditions, particularly in small-scale processes. While animated elements may be visually appealing, the maintenance and development time required often outweigh the benefits.</p>
