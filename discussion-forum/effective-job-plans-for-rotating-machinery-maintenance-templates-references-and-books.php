            <p>A job plan is a detailed set of instructions outlining the steps needed to complete repair work, including full overhauls. This plan includes information on clearances, alignment specifications, spare parts needed, and any special tools required. Job plans are typically created by referencing the machine's manual, although these manuals may not always provide all necessary details. The effectiveness of a job plan relies on the maintenance expertise and experience of the person creating it. If you would like, I can send you one of our job plans via email, although I must admit that the quality is only average. I plan to compare ours with the one that Larry will provide.

            <p>Exploring the advantages and disadvantages of creating job plans, also known as task lists, at different levels is crucial for effective maintenance strategies. These levels include: 1) Developing a generic task list based on equipment class or type such as pumps, centrifugal, rotary, or reciprocating. 2) Creating equipment-specific task lists for compressors, turbines, pumps, motors, etc. 3) Designing task lists for functional locations or systems, like compressors driven by turbines or pumps driven by motors. 

Determining the most effective and preferred approach depends on various factors. Do you have any preferred methods or samples to share? How do you generate task lists? Do you rely on OEM manuals, RCM methodologies, or other tools? Your insights and experiences are valuable in optimizing maintenance planning and execution. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When it comes to setting up a maintenance program for various systems like pumps, fans, and compressors, it's important to consider the manufacturer's recommendations and the actual failure modes. In my class, I introduce traditional maintenance practices before diving into Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Backfit RCM. I challenge students to create maintenance programs for standard electric motors and then compare them after the training. Through this exercise, they realize the importance of prioritizing equipment for maintenance and implementing condition-based maintenance strategies. This process helps them understand the impact of equipment on the overall operation and ensures that maintenance efforts are effective. By following some basic rules and principles, such as evaluating maintenance effectiveness and considering the equipment's impact on the mission, they can create more efficient maintenance programs. These insights are crucial for maintaining general facilities and equipment effectively.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with your comment regarding the importance of a maintenance task list's ability to identify and address problems. If maintenance plans and task lists are not created by maintenance personnel, but rather by a dedicated project team for new projects or modifications to existing platforms, how effective would they be in ensuring optimal performance? This raises an important question about the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance strategies in various project scenarios.</p>

            <p>Involving maintenance personnel in task development is key for effective maintenance procedures. Their real-world input and experience can enhance task efficiency. Collaboration across all levels is crucial for success. 

At my company, we work with the US Coast Guard and Navy to enhance Maintenance Procedure Cards (MPC's) and Maintenance Requirement Cards (MRC's) through Maintenance Effectiveness Reviews. This ongoing process helps us improve, eliminate, or add tasks for specific equipment or platforms. 

Since 1997, we have reduced maintenance manhours in the navy by 46% through this approach. When starting from scratch, it is important to ensure that all developed tasks are effective. While there may be instances with no historical data, it seems that Josh has valuable insights to offer on this matter. Howard.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, that approach is a recipe for disaster. If individuals working on a project are not part of the maintenance organization, it is unlikely that they will receive any collaboration or support from the on-site team. Outsiders, such as students, accountants, MBA graduates, IT professionals, equipment vendors, or someone with good writing skills but lacks hands-on experience, may struggle to gain acceptance. Without the backing of supervisors, mechanics, and technicians, if the project team is perceived as elitist, achieving buy-in will be a challenge. It is astonishing to see decision-makers underestimate the complexity of writing procedures like maintenance SOPs, assuming it can be accomplished quickly by outsiders without the institutional knowledge accumulated over the years.</p>

            <p>In today's busy world, finding time for writing can be a challenge for everyone. It can be disheartening when negative comments appear after you've put your thoughts on paper. However, don't let that deter you - the journey towards improvement will be long but worthwhile. So how can you engage others in the process? Here are some tips: 

1) Schedule bi-weekly project meetings or workshops for team members, including line-supervisors and skilled craftsmen.
2) Gain support from management to ensure participation.
3) Create a clear agenda focused on practical work-related tasks.
4) Provide visual aids and examples for complex equipment layouts.
5) Utilize technology like overhead projectors to display procedures, facilitating easier understanding.
6) Encourage sharing opinions, suggestions, and experiences.
7) Assign "homework" to be completed before the next meeting.
8) Show that you value feedback by implementing suggested changes promptly.
9) Understand that not everyone may excel in writing procedures, aim for a 40-50% proficiency rate.
10) Realize that change takes time, and two sessions may not be enough.
11) Lead by example and follow through on commitments - actions speak louder than words.</p>

            <p>I am optimistic that this idea will be successful! From my perspective, allocating 2 hours every 2 weeks should be adequate. Any additional time may strain the current workforce. Specifically, for our equipment spare list project, the staff has agreed to a monthly 1-hour review session before the project commences. They are not willing to spend extra time providing excessive information, only directing where the necessary documents can be found. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Any content exceeding 5 minutes is perceived as overwhelming, with some individuals willing to dedicate 2 hours daily to prove their hard work. Those who resist change typically have less knowledge and will be challenged by their peers during sessions. Refusing to adapt to technology may hinder the career growth of a maintenance worker. To ensure project success, take charge and appoint a leader beforehand instead of seeking one during the meeting. Remember, instructions are meant for implementation, not for display during an ISO certification audit.</p>

            <p>Josh: It is actually easier than you may think. Instead of using orders or punishment, which often backfire, you are dealing with the common challenge of employees feeling overwhelmed by new management initiatives. They may believe that if they simply ignore it, the issue will disappear. So, how do you engage them? One effective approach is to involve a key team member, as we did at a previous company I worked for. We selected a maintenance worker to lead the team in implementing ISO 9002 standards. This individual developed work instructions, procedures, and took on additional responsibilities (eventually advancing to a management role). Over time, more of the maintenance staff became engaged, providing feedback and collaborating on improvements. The chosen individual should be proactive and passionate about the project, qualities that can typically be found in most maintenance organizations.  Howard PS: If you have any questions or find this confusing, please let me know. I just completed a 14-hour drive to Chicago.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the helpful advice! How about having a celebratory gathering to recognize a successful project? While a promotion may be a tempting option, it seems to be challenging due to limitations. Perhaps securing a commitment in advance could be a more effective strategy. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Josh mentioned that a promotion wasn't necessarily the main focus of the deal. The individual in question actually valued personal recognition more than anything, which led them to seek out a promotion after a job well done. Howard</p>
