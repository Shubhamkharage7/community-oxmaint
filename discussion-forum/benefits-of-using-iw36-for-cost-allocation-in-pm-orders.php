                    <p>Hello everyone, I have a question regarding the use of transaction IW36 in my company. We were advised by Logica not to use this transaction as it may cause more issues than it solves. However, I believe we could benefit from utilizing IW36. I am seeking clarification on whether the collective costs of sub orders raised to a superior PM order are allocated to the superior order, while individual costs are allocated to specific sub orders. This would allow me to easily track total expenses by looking at the superior order. Have any of you used IW36 before? Do you find it helpful, or would you recommend using sequential PMOs as Logica suggested? Thank you for your input.</p>

            <p>Suborders serve a dual purpose in maintenance management - they can address any issues discovered during planned maintenance work and also help in categorizing major works based on disciplines such as static, rotating, electrical, and instrument. For example, a comprehensive work order for overhauling rotating equipment can have suborders for each discipline involved. This allows for a detailed breakdown of costs for each suborder and ensures all work is completed before the final closure of the main work order. This feature acts as a helpful reminder to ensure thorough completion of all maintenance tasks.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, if I understand your post correctly... the main point is that the superior order will consolidate the costs of all sub orders under it - meaning if I want to find out the total cost of all sub orders, I should refer to the superior order, right? The requirement for all other tasks to be completed before the superior order can be closed is very helpful to me. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Absolutely! The cost for any January39 sub-order will automatically be aggregated into the superior order. You can view the total cost in the superior order and easily navigate to any specific sub-order to see the individual costs. For example, you can access the cost overview for a specific sub-order by navigating to the Goto menu in the superior order and selecting Extras -> Sub order -> Cost overview. This allows you to easily track the costs associated with each sub-order.</p>

            <p>I am currently working on a project where I have raised a challenge with Logica regarding the use of sub-orders. Their response was that "The use of sub-orders creates more problems than it solves, we recommend using sequential PM orders." I couldn't get any more information from them at this time. I will keep you updated on the outcome and may need your assistance in updating my business case if they reject the use of sub-orders. It seems that my company is hesitant to adopt this new approach, which is causing some hesitation. @Josh - They are hesitant about me using IW36 within the QAS clients, which was the first thing I asked about. (frustrating). Thank you all for your help and support, it is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Apologies for replying to an older thread, but I found this topic fascinating. I'm curious if it's feasible to create a Maintenance Plan that automatically generates sub orders for the main order. For instance, if a system Equipment Number (such as a Tank or Fermentor) has 10 instruments attached to it, can we set up a Maintenance Plan to generate the main order (for Maintenance PM purposes) and have the sub orders with matching Basic Finish Dates? This would streamline the maintenance process and ensure efficient scheduling.</p>

I am interested to know if it is feasible to establish a Maintenance Plan that automatically generates sub-orders for the main order. For instance, if a system Equipment Number (such as a Tank or Fermentor) has 10 instruments attached to it, can we create the main order through a Maintenance Plan (to be used for Maintenance PM) and have the Sub Orders created with the same Basic Finish Date as the main order? I am somewhat puzzled as to why sub-orders would be necessary, as multiple maintenance items could achieve the same result when assigned to a single maintenance plan. Sub-orders are typically useful in situations where a piece of equipment breaks down and will be out of commission for a few days, but you do not want the entire downtime to impact your business KPI. Essentially, you can confirm (CNF) the main order and then create a sub-order detailing the required repairs and capacity plan in accordance with your planning process.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How does IW36 handle cost allocation for sub orders and superior PM orders?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - One user mentioned that using IW36 could potentially allow for collective costs of sub orders to be allocated to a superior PM order, while individual costs are allocated to specific sub orders. This feature could aid in tracking total expenses more efficiently. It would be beneficial to explore this functionality in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Have others found IW36 helpful for tracking expenses in PM orders?</h4>
