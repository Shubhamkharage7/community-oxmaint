            <p>One way to transfer information from FTV Studio to Excel is by copying and pasting. However, a potential issue arises if the recipe file is not included in the project file and is saved on the HMI instead. In this case, you will need to copy the file from the HMI, import it into the project on your desk, and then you can open it in Excel for copying and pasting. This process may help streamline your workflow.</p>
