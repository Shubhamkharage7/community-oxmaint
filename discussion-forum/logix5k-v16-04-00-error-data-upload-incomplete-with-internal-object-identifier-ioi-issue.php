                    <p>When attempting to save a project in Logix5K version V16.04.00 (CPR 9), an error message may appear: "Data upload did not complete.

            <p>If you are experiencing issues with DrivesAOP on your computer, it might be beneficial to install the latest version. You can download the update at www.ab.com/support/abdrives/webupdate/software.html. This could potentially help resolve any problems you are encountering with your DrivesAOP software.</p>

            <p>It seems there may be a potential issue with the DrivesAOP software on your PC. To troubleshoot, consider updating the software by visiting www.ab.com/support/abdrives/webupdate/software.html. I have not explored the functionality of DrivesAOP yet, as I am currently not using those specific features. However, I have successfully uploaded other PLCs on the network. 

Interestingly, a colleague alerted me to the issue, prompting me to investigate further. Initially, when attempting to connect to the PLC in question through RSLinx, it did not appear in the list. After closing the program and reopening it, the PLC finally appeared in the rack as expected. 

A screenshot has been provided below as evidence. Although the PLC is now visible, there was an initial hiccup where it did not show up on the first attempt. Thank you for your assistance and advice.</p>

            <p>In response to jkerekes' inquiry, I referenced a RA technote for the suggestion I provided. Have you tried implementing the suggestion? If not, could you provide the specific error number or code you are encountering? It appears that the issue mentioned is related to Rockwell drives, which I am not currently using. Therefore, there is no need for me to update anything. The error message displayed is only a messagebox with no further details available. Searching for error code 732-80042983 yields no relevant results. According to the help file, it states that "Some data may have been uploaded, but RSLogix 5000 can offer no additional information." This information may prove useful in troubleshooting the issue.</p>

For example, their current L-61 unit is almost at its maximum capacity, leading to issues when saving and uploading current values. Avoiding the upload process allows for successful saving. It is worth noting that despite this issue, only 10-20% of the processor memory is being utilized.</p>

Currently, both the .ACD and .L5K files are saved on my laptop. This issue also occurs with the MDT autosave software, which is connected to our network drive without any problems.

However, the final unit I worked on presented challenges during the upload process, specifically when uploading the tags database. Despite trying different methods such as using Ethernet, a switch, a crossover cable, and RS232 through the CPU comm port, the error described in this thread persisted.

This leads me to believe that the issue may not lie with the software itself, but rather with a system setting that was present on my old 32-bit machine but not on the new 64-bit one. In summary, while Windows 7 is generally compatible with v13, there may be external factors that could disrupt its functionality for you.</p>

            <p>Encountering an upload error IOI destination unknown in Logix Designer? Although this may be an old issue, it is common for newcomers. To resolve this, try saving the project without uploading tag data, closing and reopening it. Then navigate to communication/who active, select the processor, and upload the entire project from the controller. Go online after completion to re-save the project and upload the tag data successfully. This solution is often overlooked for error code 732-80042983, so hopefully, this can assist others facing the same issue.</p>

            <p>Import Error - Possible Causes and Solutions

Encountered an error while importing a file? Here are some common issues that might be causing the problem:

1. Unsupported Components: The file you're trying to import contains components that are not compatible with the import process. Check the Errors window for a list of these components.

2. Tag Memory Limit: Running low on memory can prevent the import process from completing successfully.

3. Controller Lock: Trying to modify a controller that is currently locked by another workstation? Wait for the controller to be unlocked before making any changes.

4. Security Settings: If you're trying to import a secured .L5X file from RSLogix 5000 without security enabled, it won't work. Make sure security is properly configured in RSLogix 5000 to open secured project files.

If you're unsure how to configure security settings, contact your security administrator for assistance.</p>
