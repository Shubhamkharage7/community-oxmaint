            <p>Hey Steve, how can we determine if the system is resonating (or what leads you to suspect it)? Is it because it's moving almost perfectly in-phase? Thanks a lot for the information.</p>

            <p>Hello Felipe, I was anticipating Steve's response to your inquiry. Vibration measurements were taken at specific numbered points, with calculations made between these points to determine average movement. Points 59 and 60 are moving in unison but opposite to the other half of the motor, suggesting misaligned DOFs. To rectify this issue, adding a minus sign in the block file is recommended. Additionally, a mode shape is evident at point 74 on the base. Below is how I interpret the animation:</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I recently rediscovered this forum after a link was shared on the vib forum. I'll attempt to help answer Felipe's question, though Steve and Jon may have more insight. It appears to be a classic case of rocking base resonance, evident by a few key factors: 1 - A significantly higher H than V indicates a directional issue. 2 - The base is moving nearly as much as the machines themselves (around 50%), which is a telltale sign of a resonant base. 3 - It seems likely that the component between the pump and motor is a gearbox, leading to differences in running speed. The vibration aligning with the motor speed suggests resonance through the base. Agreeing with Jon, points 59 and 60 appear to be abnormal.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your patience. I must disclose that this was my first ODS/Modal project using ME'Scope and IOTech equipment, which leaves room for errors. Moving forward, I aim to redo this project and gather more data on the motor points. Apart from the structures displayed in the model, the pump is mounted on a steel plate supported by I-Beams. Although I collected data on the plate, it didn't show significant response, so it was excluded from the animation. To collect data at points 59 and 60, I had to adjust the orientation of my accelerometer from the standard +X / -Y / +Z to the flipped +X / +Y / -Z orientation. I updated the orientation in the block file to ensure correct data, though I acknowledge it may appear confusing. The reason for suspecting resonance is the distinct horizontal versus vertical vibration at running speed, with the FRF and Coherence data indicating a peak near 30 Hz. Seeking guidance from experienced individuals like Jon to confirm the resonance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Steve.</p>

            <p>In analyzing the base at point 74, a mode shape does seem to be present. To enhance resolution, additional points can be included in the base. To visualize the actual movement, consider activating the options "animate/contours/fill" and "animate/contours/values". To focus on the motor end of the animation, turn off the sub-structures for the fan and bearing pedestal, and then share a quad-view for a more detailed examination. It is possible that there is erroneous data present. While points 83 and 84 appear to be correct, points 59 and 60 may have issues. Verify the block data for these points and ensure that 83 and 59 are opposite in the "Y" direction, and 84 and 60 are opposite in the "Y" direction. The reason for the reversal in the "Z" direction is still unclear.</p>

            <p>Hello Jon, I wanted to share my experience with flipping the Z-Axis using a tri-axial accelerometer and magnets. I found success by mounting the accelerometer at points 59 & 60, which required a change in orientation to achieve +X / +Y / -Z. You can find more information on this method in the link provided: http://maintenanceforums.com/e...1082983/m/8911053104. Best, Steve.</p>

            <p>Steve, I have concerns about the polarity (phase) of your measurement points on the motor. The data indicates that the motor case is distorting, but I am skeptical that this is actually happening. When looking at points 59 & 60 for horizontal motion, they should be moving outward while base points 73 & 74 for vertical motion should be moving upward. In our previous conversation referenced in the Link provided, we talked about challenges with mounting triaxial accelerometers. It can be tricky to ensure that the accelerometer axis (data channels) align properly with the structure's coordinate system (+X, +Y, +Z). I recommend checking mode shape plots (without any fancy animations) to ensure that the mode shape aligns logically. If not, further data is necessary to confirm any anomalies. Does this information resonate with you? Walt</p>

            <p>Hello Steve, I would prefer to discuss this matter privately via email, if that works for you. Your animation indicates that the horizontal radial is oriented in the "Y" direction, while the Vertical is in the "Z" direction and the Axial is in the "X" direction. This is why I have been emphasizing the importance of examining the data along the "Y" axis. I'm not sure if you've had a chance to review this conversation, but here's a valuable insight I gained through experience: Accelerometer Orientation.</p>

            <p>Hi Walt, I completely understand and share your concern. I will make a concerted effort to retrieve the data and pay special attention to the sensor alignment. Regarding the use of a tri-axial sensor discussed in a previous conversation, I am struggling to figure out how to capture data in all three dimensions at certain points. How is this accomplished with a single-axis transducer? Additionally, we have just completed an outage and the sister pump is now operational. Would it be beneficial to gather modal data with both pumps running? Alternatively, I could conduct an operational deflection shape analysis. It's important to note that when the turbine-generator unit is online, I am experiencing significant background vibration and interference from the main generator. Jon, I have sent an email as per our discussion. Thank you, Steve.</p>
