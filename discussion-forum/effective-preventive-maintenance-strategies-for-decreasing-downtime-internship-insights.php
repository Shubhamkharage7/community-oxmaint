                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently interning at a small car manufacturing company, focusing on implementing Preventive Maintenance strategies to decrease downtime. Despite my background in sensor technology, I lack experience in maintenance. My main task involves analyzing downtime records, which primarily stem from machine breakdowns, as well as potential issues like water leaks and pump noises. The company's maintenance routine consists of daily visual inspections by operators and periodic maintenance by a small team of maintenance personnel.

To address this challenge, I plan to classify equipment based on manufacturer, type, and operational status. I will calculate Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for similar equipment to establish appropriate maintenance intervals. Additionally, I intend to utilize Pareto analysis to identify the top 20% of equipment responsible for 80% of downtime, and apply Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to prioritize critical failure modes for daily inspections.

However, I am unsure about devising a comprehensive periodic maintenance schedule solely based on MTBF, as failure occurrence is unpredictable. While some suggest using the P-F curve method, determining the P-F interval requires monitoring each machine's failure modes, which is not feasible due to limited resources and a short internship duration.

Considering these constraints, I believe focusing on enhancing daily inspection tasks, such as training operators in visual inspections and incorporating critical failures into their routines, is a practical approach. Any suggestions or guidance on overcoming this challenge would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my detailed explanation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>During your brief 3-month internship, I recommend focusing on identifying and addressing the 20% of equipment that is responsible for 80% of downtime. By analyzing the records of downtime, you can pinpoint these 'bad actors' and work on improving their Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). Develop a preventive maintenance program using the OEM user manual as a foundation, and enhance it further with techniques like Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) or Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Monitor the trending MTBF of these crucial assets over time to track progress.

It is crucial to prioritize basic equipment care, including cleanliness, lubrication, and minor adjustments, as part of frontline maintenance conducted by operators. This foundational maintenance should be followed by more advanced techniques implemented by technicians. Incorporating basic equipment care into daily inspections can help minimize downtime and ensure smooth operations.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Once you have determined the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for the unreliable equipment, it is essential to cross-reference these values with industry benchmarks, such as those provided by renowned author HP Bloch in his comprehensive 4-volume series. This comparison will indicate whether the equipment's MTBF values fall within, below, or above the expected range.</p>

            <p>Utilizing MTBF as a measure of machine reliability is straightforward, although it's important to note that machines may not necessarily fail at the MTBF value, as failures are often random as mentioned in the N&H RCM curve report. To improve MTBF values, implementing condition-based monitoring is one of the recommended options. The RCM decision-making process includes options such as running to failure, scheduled replacement or discard, on-condition maintenance, redesign, or redundancy.</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me.

            <p>Calculating the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for each failure mode of equipment components can be a lengthy and time-consuming process due to the numerous failure modes present. The effectiveness of MTBF is hindered by the randomness of most failures, making scheduled maintenance less impactful. To expedite the process, focus on determining the mean time between failures for the equipment as a whole, particularly for failures resulting in downtime.</p>
