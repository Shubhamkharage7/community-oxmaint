                    <p>Hi there! I'm curious if there's a standalone alternative to using an ethernet cable for connecting to a PLC. Is there a "dongle" available that I can connect to my PLC and another to my laptop to create a wireless connection? This way, I can easily bring my laptop with me to the machine. I'm looking for a simple solution that doesn't require multiple routers, as I visit various factories.</p>

            <p>I utilized Bluetooth technology for my machines in a cleanroom to avoid the hassle of dressing up and being physically present in the room. With the convenience of being able to control the machines from outside the room through a window, I found it to be effective. I believe Bluetooth technology has advanced significantly since then, making it worth considering a Bluetooth adapter for improved connectivity.</p>

            <p>To improve network connectivity, I set up a cost-effective WiFi router by disabling DHCP and assigning a static IP within the PLC subnet. I also configured my laptop with a static IP for a seamless connection. Adjusting the IP address may be necessary depending on the specific PLC or system setup, but it's a quick process.</p>

            <p>When setting up a WiFi router for a PLC system, it is important to disable DHCP and assign a static IP address within the subnet. By connecting a laptop with a matching static IP, the setup process can be quickly completed. It may be necessary to adjust the IP address depending on the specific configuration of each PLC or system. Utilizing a reliable router like the MikroTik RB952Ui-5ac2nD can ensure smooth operation. In situations where mobility is required, a micro-USB to ethernet adapter can be used instead of relocating the router for each job.</p>

            <p>Looking for a budget-friendly wireless travel router? Check out the refurbished gl.inet Beryl GL-MT1300 available for only 20€ on the official store. Even though it's a refurb, it's still a steal at this price point. If you're on a tighter budget, consider a 20€ TP Link router with 2.4GHz capabilities. It may not be as advanced as the gl.inet, but it gets the job done, especially if you need to VNC into HMIs.</p>

            <p>To establish a connection, simply link a WiFi Access Point to your PLC and connect your laptop to the newly created WiFi network. No additional devices need to be connected to the laptop. Ensure that both the PLC and the AP share the same network mask, typically set at 255.255.255.0, with distinct IPs such as 192.168.1.1 for the AP and 192.168.1.2 for the PLC. Upon connection to the new WiFi network, the AP's DHCP will automatically assign an IP address to your laptop. Consider using a basic model like the popular D-Link DAP-2020 as your Access Point.</p>

            <p>Looking to make your PLC wireless? One solution is to power an HMI panel with batteries and connect it wirelessly to your home network. This allows you to control your trains from any room in your house. By plugging the HMI panel into a PLC with Ethernet, you can enable wireless control using your laptop. Just make sure to supply it with a 5V power source, such as a small USB battery bank. Check out the VAP11G-300 from Vonets for more information on this wireless solution.</p>

            <p>WhinnieThePooh commented, "Yes, that is all it is. Unfortunately, my laptop lacks an ethernet port and even a standard USB port, which is why I need to use a device like this." I used to be frustrated with the absence of these ports on newer laptops, but I have grown fond of USB adapters as they have helped reduce my network issues. Additionally, Windows conveniently saves the configurations for each adapter, making it easy to switch between different subnets by labeling and swapping them out as needed. This simple solution saves time and effort. For the original poster looking for a travel router, I recommend considering options like the TP Link.</p>

            <p>Due to heightened security measures in modern facilities, the use of wireless technology is often restricted to prevent hacking threats. This limitation is especially common when dealing with IT professionals unfamiliar with industrial networks, who tend to view everything through the lens of potential vulnerabilities like those found in Microsoft systems. Some clients even go as far as prohibiting the use of wired connections for laptops, requiring the use of their own PCs instead.</p>

            <p>By setting up your own WiFi network and connecting an Access Point (AP) to the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), you can create a separate, secure network. This configuration ensures that the PLC is only accessible within this isolated network, completely segregated from the factory network, whether wired or wireless. This setup enhances security and control over PLC data access.</p>

            <p>One way to ensure network security is by setting up a dedicated WiFi network, where an Access Point (AP) is connected to a Power Line Communication (PLC) system. This setup allows exclusive access to the PLC, effectively isolating it from the main factory network. Many IT professionals, including those from Phoenix and Devry, may not fully grasp this concept.</p>

            <p>According to robertmee, the debate about IT graduates from schools like Pheonix and Devry lacking understanding is a common one. It is widely believed that breaking into encrypted WiFi networks is nearly impossible for the average person, while gaining physical access to unprotected Ethernet networks is much easier. In most cases, accessing the LAN network physically is a simpler task than attempting to crack WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone, I'm looking for a standalone solution to replace traditional ethernet cables when connecting to a PLC. Is there a "dongle" available that can create a wireless connection between my PLC and laptop, allowing me to easily move around with my laptop? I need something simple that doesn't require multiple routers, as I work in various factories. Perhaps a Mikrotik RouterBoard like the one mentioned can be powered directly from a 24V cabinet supply, setting it apart from consumer devices that typically require wall adapters.</p>
