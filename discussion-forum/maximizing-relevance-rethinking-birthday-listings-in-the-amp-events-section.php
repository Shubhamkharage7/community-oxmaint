                    <p>Thinking about removing the birthday display on the website. It is unclear if the birthday listings are actually helpful. With 53667 members, there are on average 147 birthdays celebrated each day. This makes it difficult to find other important events.

            <p>I agree with John's perspective on listing birthdays for all the members in the community. It's impractical and unnecessary, as most people do not pay attention to them. While it's important to foster a sense of community, we should avoid turning this platform into just another social networking site. Let's focus on what sets us apart and provides value to our users.</p>

            <p>We value your feedback and understand your concerns, but we want to experiment with including birthdays for a while to enhance communication and connection within our community. While we understand that our platform is not Facebook, we believe there is value in acknowledging and celebrating birthdays. If you prefer not to see birthdays on the calendar, you can easily view other events by clicking the Calendar Link, selecting CRL events from the drop-down menu, or subscribing to iCal. Additionally, we are in the process of planning a major website redesign to make it more responsive across all devices by September/October 2015. Your feedback on birthdays has been duly noted and will be taken into consideration during our planning discussions. Stay tuned for updates on our progress.</p>

            <p>Looking for a way to view your calendar without birthdays on a consistent basis? Simply follow these steps: 1) Click the Calendar Link, 2) Select CRL events from the drop-down menu, or 3) Subscribe to iCal. These changes should be permanent unless you exit and re-enter, which will revert back to the default birthday list.</p>

            <p>It's important to remember, John, that this forum is more than just a community service - it's a business. With a focus on increasing page views and ad clicks, expanding the user base is essential to drive revenue growth. However, finding a balance is crucial to avoid alienating the core contributors who have made this platform successful. What if the top 40 or 50 posters decided to take their conversations elsewhere? It's a possibility that needs to be considered.</p>

            <p>I believe in the importance of letting individuals create their own interpretations of forums, which adds to their uniqueness. These forums have been provided as a community service without seeking to generate profits. Turning it into a business would not align with our intentions. Perhaps I should consider launching a vibe service company instead! It's important to recognize the multitude of options available for people to engage, connect, and exchange ideas. I actively participate in various platforms and derive valuable insights from each. We wholeheartedly support knowledge sharing across all venues and forums. As the proud stewards of these forums, members can rely on us for support. Thank you, Terry O.</p>
