            <p>When considering a new project, the use of wireless technology for monitoring velocity and acceleration can have a significant impact on Return on Investment (ROI) compared to traditional wired solutions. The advantages of 24-7 monitoring integrated with an Equipment Condition Monitoring (ECM) system are invaluable compared to monthly check-ins. Even in an existing location, there will still be costs associated with technician data collection, but having a dedicated analyst can streamline the process. The continuous monitoring benefits are still present, making it easier to justify the investment when considering the true cost of downtime for your operations. In response to Jacob Loverich's inquiry about comparing the costs of online wireless vibration monitoring versus route-based monitoring, it's important to weigh the benefits and potential cost savings of each approach. For internal vibration monitoring programs, there may be a typical number of points per analyst responsible for, depending on the industry standard. Any insights or recommendations on this topic would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Victor E Rioli.</p>

            <p>Andy Rodes, the VP of Operations at VibeCloud Reliability, discusses the comparison between the costs of online wireless vibration monitoring and route-based vibration monitoring. He has been in the industry for nearly two decades and has extensive experience in analyzing various approaches when it comes to condition monitoring. According to Rodes, there is no fixed industry standard cost per point for vibe routes from third-party service providers like his company.

When running a vibration program internally, Rodes suggests that having two certified vibration analysts, with one gathering data and the other analyzing it, can handle around 4-6k points with monthly readings and analysis. Factors such as the location of the facility, number of components monitored, and sampling frequency play a crucial role in determining the scope and cost of monitoring solutions.

Rodes emphasizes the importance of using wireless sensors with a minimum of 10khz velocity spectrum range to provide analysts with the most data for accurate analysis. While sensor pricing can be complex, Rodes mentions that their preferred sensor starts at $26 per month and includes everything from sensors to full analysis by certified analysts.

In conclusion, Rodes points out that for facilities looking to monitor 75 components or more, monthly walking route vibration analysis is usually more cost-effective compared to online monitoring solutions with wireless sensors. He also mentions working on a white paper to further explore the pros and cons of wireless sensors versus walking route monitoring. For more information, readers can reach out to Rodes for a copy of the white paper once it is completed.</p>

            <p>When considering a monitoring solution for your assets, it is recommended to opt for a hybrid approach. Utilize online monitoring for your most critical Tier 1 assets, while utilizing route-based monitoring for Tier 2-3 assets. A well-implemented route-based program can efficiently collect data on 70 assets and 315 bearings every day. This translates to a cost of $11.43 per bearing. On the other hand, an online monitoring program provides comprehensive spectral data 240 times a month with advanced sensors and analysis tools. The monthly cost for this program ranges from $29 to $35 per bearing, providing significantly more data and expertise compared to traditional monthly monitoring. Contact us for a detailed breakdown of the pricing and services included in both our online and route monitoring programs. Let's discuss further how we can tailor a solution to meet your specific needs. ------------------------------ Michael Bernhard ------------------------------</p>

Your input is greatly valued and has provided me with valuable guidance. -------------------------------- Jacob Loverich ------------------------------ Original Message --------------- Original Message: Sent: 06-13-2023 15:18 From: Michael Bernhard Subject: Route vs Online Vibration Monitoring Cost Jacob, It is advisable to consider a combination of online and route-based monitoring solutions. Online monitoring may be more suitable for tier 1 critical assets, while route-based monitoring can be effective for tier 2-3 assets. A well-structured route-based program can gather data on around 70 assets and 315 bearings per day. With a daily labor rate of $1500-$2000, the cost would amount to $3600 for 70 assets or approximately $11.43 per bearing. On the other hand, an online program involves various charges depending on the system used, sensor quality, and data reliability. Our system, for instance, collects full spectral data 8 times a day (240 times a month) using a Tri-Axial/temp sensor and includes installation, hardware, software, and CAT III monitoring for equipment with prescriptive asset alerts. The monthly cost per sensor ranges from $35 to $29 per bearing, providing significantly more data points compared to monthly route-based monitoring. I can provide a detailed breakdown of pricing and services for both online and route-based monitoring options. Please let me know if you would like more information. -------------------------------- Michael Bernhard Original Message: Sent: 06-08-2023 09:43 From: Jacob Loverich Subject: Route vs Online Vibration Monitoring Cost I am interested in comparing the costs of online wireless vibration monitoring versus route-based vibration monitoring.

            <p>When utilizing route-based data collection, a key advantage is having a technician physically inspecting the machines. This allows for early detection of issues such as oil leaks, slipping belts, and more before they become apparent on a remote monitoring system. This proactive approach can save both time and money in preventing potential equipment failures.

Regarding the comparison between route-based and online vibration monitoring costs, it is beneficial to consider a blended solution. Online monitoring is ideal for critical assets, while route-based monitoring can efficiently cover Tier 2-3 assets. A well-executed route-based program can gather data from 60-80 assets per day, equating to approximately 70 assets and 315 bearings. With a daily labor rate ranging from $1500 to $2000, the cost for a day of route data collection and analysis is estimated at $3600, or $11.43 per bearing.

On the other hand, an online monitoring program involves various costs depending on the system and sensor quality. Our system, for example, captures full spectral data 8 times a day using a Tri-Axial/temp sensor, providing detailed insights and alerts without the need to purchase equipment. The monthly cost per sensor ranges from $29 to $35, offering significantly more data points and expert analysis compared to traditional monthly monitoring.

In conclusion, a comprehensive analysis of pricing and services for both online and route-based vibration monitoring programs is essential to determine the most cost-effective solution for your specific needs. Feel free to reach out for further information and a detailed overview of our offerings. Your proactive approach to monitoring can contribute to significant cost savings and enhanced equipment reliability.
