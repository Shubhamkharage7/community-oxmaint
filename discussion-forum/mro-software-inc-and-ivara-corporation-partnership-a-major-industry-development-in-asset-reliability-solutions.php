While opinions may vary on whether CMMS or reliability should take the lead, it is evident that both are essential components that need to work in tandem for effective maintenance strategies.

            <p>I believe that both are essential.

            <p>Several issues are at play here: 1) Historically, many CMMS/EAM vendors have lacked understanding of the processes they automate, except for those who have a clear understanding of the industry. 2) The key to reliability does not solely rely on software solutions like CMMS/EAM or specialized programs such as Ivara EXP or Meridium. The focus should be on establishing effective processes, with technology serving as a valuable tool rather than a cure-all. 3) Meridium offers RCMO (Reliability Centered Maintenance Optimization) software for SAP-PM/EAM as an official SAP "Partner". 4) Both Meridium and Ivara collaborate with various CMMS/EAM systems, with recent partnerships with MRO and SAP being more about marketing than anything else. 5) These collaborations signify a growing awareness and interest in the maintenance and reliability sector, particularly with major players like SAP and Oracle making moves into the industry. 6) It's promising for the maintenance and reliability field that industry giants such as SAP and Oracle are expressing interest and gaining influence in this space, potentially impacting decision-makers at all levels of organizations. Your company's executives may value their conversations with SAP/Oracle executives more than their discussions with you on EAM and reliability strategies. These developments highlight the evolving landscape of the industry.</p>

            <p>At present, I am heavily involved in this market and upon reviewing this specific deal, I find it to be different from the typical RCMO engagements I am familiar with. This deal originates from Maximo, rather than SAP, which is significant considering SAP's limited focus on the AM sector despite recent developments in Europe. The emphasis here is not on software, but rather on thoughtware and leveraging the expertise of individuals to drive reliability initiatives forward.

It is worth noting that Ivara, the owners of Aladon, coined the term "thoughtware" in our industry. This partnership between a leading CMMS creator with a strong market presence and a company holding the intellectual property developed under MOubray's guidance is a noteworthy development. Despite Oracle's absence in the markets I operate in, as well as the lack of visibility of smaller systems, this collaboration holds substantial potential.

In conclusion, the union between these two entities opens up avenues for discussions on EAM and reliability, previously overlooked in favor of ERP-related conversations. It is frustrating to observe how executives may place more trust in SAP/Oracle counterparts, undermining internal expertise and knowledge within the organization.</p>

In my interactions with IBM consultants, they firmly believe they are the global leaders in transformative management consulting, a claim that's hard to dispute. The recent acquisition of MRO software at a premium price is a clear indicator of IBM's and Maximo's aggressive foray into the asset-intensive industry sector.

            <p>Inquiring minds may be curious about the predecessors to MS Office 1.0. Before Excel came onto the scene, many users were familiar with Lotus 123 and Symphony. WordStar was not as well-received. And let's not forget the renowned (or perhaps notorious) Dbase III before the advent of MS Access.</p>

            <p>In addition to DBase, users often turned to Paradox as an alternative, while Quattro Pro served as a replacement for Lotus 123. My first word processing experience was with WordStar, followed by Wordperfect 4.0.</p>

            <p>In 1997, there were three widely accepted popular office suites globally: Corel Perfect Office featuring WordPerfect, Quattro Pro, and CorelDraw; Microsoft Office, which remains a powerhouse; and Lotus SmartSuite with 123 and WordPro. Lotus made significant investments in email applications, partnering with IBM to develop Lotus Notes as a competitor to Microsoft Exchange Server. Corel, on the other hand, focused on establishing a strong presence in graphic design applications.</p>
