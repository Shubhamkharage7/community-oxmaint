                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Currently, we are utilizing the MP2 Access 2000 version for our maintenance tasks. We have recently onboarded a new employee to handle our maintenance PM's. However, the tasks in our system are still assigned to a previous employee who is no longer with us. Is there a method to efficiently transfer all these tasks from the old employee to the new one in a batch, rather than having to manually reassign them one by one? Any advice or guidance on this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Kim.</p>

            <p>There is currently no automated feature in MP2 for transferring tasks from one employee to another. However, a workaround could involve utilizing Microsoft Access to directly access the database and make the necessary changes. This method is more efficient for managing a high volume of tasks.</p>

            <p>In List view, changing the "Assigned to" entry can be quickly accomplished with a few simple steps. First, navigate to the Tasks module and select the list view Tab. Then, position your Cursor in the "Assigned to" field and sort alphabetically. To change the Assignee, use the Lookup feature to select the new one and copy it to the clipboard by pressing Ctrl + C. Move to the next record using the Down arrow key and paste the new Assignee by pressing Ctrl + V. Repeat this process for multiple records to efficiently update them. This method allows you to update numerous entries within a short span of 10 to 15 minutes. For any inquiries, feel free to reach out to me at df@flemingtechnical.com or 678-777-9015.
