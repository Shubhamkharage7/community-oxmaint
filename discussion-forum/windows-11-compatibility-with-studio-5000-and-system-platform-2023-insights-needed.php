                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! I recently received two brand new Dell desktops from a client for software installation on a project. One will be used for a standalone InTouch installation with SP2023, while the other is for Studio 5000 and several other programs. Our original plan was to use V34 firmware on Logix Designer as V35 wasn't officially supported with System Platform 2023 in the past. Despite our specific request for Windows 10 Ent to be installed, the client did not comply. I anticipate potential issues with outdated software, particularly with Studio 5000 and SP23 compatibility. Before returning the desktop, I am curious if anyone has experience using Windows 11 with Studio and/or SP2023. Your insights would be greatly appreciated as I seek clarity on this matter. Thank you.</p>

            <p>While I can't vouch for System Platform, I can confirm that I've successfully installed and operated all versions of Logix, from V10 to V35, on Windows 11 ARM. While some versions required some troubleshooting, I recall that V34 and V35 were particularly smooth and trouble-free to set up.</p>

            <p>I am currently unable to check as I have unplugged it, but I believe the operating system is restricted to Windows 11 Pro X64. I came across a few discussions about Windows 11 and was curious about the ARM compatibility. After researching, I noticed that Aveva includes Windows 11 in its list of supported OSs. However, running it on Windows 10 Enterprise has been challenging, and I am hesitant to encounter any issues on site. Although Rockwell does not support Windows 11, it would be less problematic if it does not work than the main screen. The main issue is that Studio 5000 will be installed on the engineering station along with other software that currently requires Windows 7 or even Windows XP compatibility mode to function properly. Unfortunately, I am unsure how to address this. I am also uncertain if there is a way to downgrade from Windows 11 to Windows 10 with a fresh out-of-the-box installation. In the past, I used to rebuild PCs for the enjoyment of it using a DVD (or CD?) copy of Windows 7 or XP, but now it feels mundane.</p>

            <p>Rockwell software is optimized for x64 architecture, making it compatible with ARM through emulation. The compatibility of ARM with x64 ensures that software will function seamlessly across different platforms.</p>
