            <p>When selecting group members, it is essential to maximize the collective knowledge of equipment within the group. This means including equipment operators, as they possess valuable insights that can often go unrecognized if not specifically sought out. In a recent analysis session I led, we had a team consisting of three maintainers and two operators. The maintainers were able to uncover new information about the equipment, including previously unknown failure modes and a deeper understanding of the impact of failures, thanks to the firsthand experiences shared by the operators. Likewise, the operators gained insights into why equipment wears out over time and the importance of allowing maintainers to perform necessary maintenance work. By leveraging their newfound knowledge, operators are now able to identify and report potential failures that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. I always make it a point to include operators in the group, as their absence is keenly felt when they are not present.</p>

            <p>While it may be tempting to omit certain groups from reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) analyses due to various constraints such as limited resources or time, it is crucial to involve operations personnel in the process. Their firsthand knowledge of the effects of each failure mode is invaluable in accurately assessing the consequences for safety and the environment. By including operations personnel in RCM, hidden risks can be identified and addressed, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of the maintenance process and reducing potential dangers. Their input is essential for ensuring that the RCM analysis is thorough and comprehensive.</p>

            <p>When considering potential candidates for your Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) team, it's important to evaluate their level of experience and the value they could bring. While short-term employees may offer some benefits, a long-term employee, possibly a former supervisor with hands-on experience, could provide more stability and insight, even if their knowledge isn't the most current. Making the right choice for your RCM team is crucial for success. - Mike.</p>

            <p>The operators play a crucial role in the reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) team as they are constantly interacting with the equipment. Good technicians often seek input from operators to gather background information on equipment failures before troubleshooting. While maintenance techs may have broader responsibilities, operators possess specialized knowledge and insight into specific equipment that is invaluable. Both roles are essential in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of equipment.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I'm impressed by this website and would love to become a member. I fully agree with all the opinions shared here. Operators play a crucial role as a valuable source of information, given their hands-on experience with equipment on a daily basis. Their insights can be extremely helpful for cross checking and validating data on failure modes and other issues. Thank you, Alan Libertus.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, a key aspect of conducting a successful RCM analysis is to involve a diverse team, which should include operators. Operators often play a significant role in equipment failures, such as not allowing equipment to be taken out of service for maintenance or using equipment beyond its intended capabilities. Drawing from my own experience, operators offer a unique perspective that is valuable to both maintenance and engineering teams. It is essential to have operators as stakeholders in the process to ensure the RCM analysis is effective. Success relies on their input and collaboration throughout the analysis process.</p>
