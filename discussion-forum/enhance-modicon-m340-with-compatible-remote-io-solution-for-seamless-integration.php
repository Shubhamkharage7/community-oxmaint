                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! I am currently utilizing a Modicon M340 system equipped with built-in Modbus and Ethernet functionalities. I am interested in expanding the system with remote IOs. Unfortunately, Schneider's Advantys OTB and STB options are not suitable due to various reasons. 

It is important to note that the onboard ethernet port does not support IO scanning. To incorporate remote IOs with the M340, one option is to add an additional ethernet module (such as NOE) that supports IO scanning. Alternatively, there may be a method to achieve this using the existing onboard ethernet capabilities. 

I am seeking recommendations for a remote IO solution that is compatible with ethernet (specifically Modbus TCP/IP) for seamless integration with the M340. While I have not previously worked with Wago, I have heard they offer suitable remote IOs. Could you kindly suggest a specific part number for the interface to aid in my search? 

Thank you in advance for any guidance you can provide.</p>

            <p>Unlock the potential of B&R's X20 IO with the ModbusTCP bus controller for seamless integration and control. Easily program the bus controller using the complimentary FieldbusDESIGNER software, available for download on their website. This setup allows you to access coils and registers with a Modbus TCP Master (client) at a cost-effective price point. For a more rugged solution, consider B&R's machine mount IP67 IO system, which eliminates the need for a panel. While this option may come at a higher price compared to the X20, its durability and performance make it a worthwhile investment.</p>

            <p>If you are considering using read_var / write_var function blocks with the processor port, I would advise against it. While it is technically possible, the time spent programming and debugging these blocks outweighs any potential benefits. In my experience, using IOScanner is a much faster and more efficient option. Here are some alternatives to consider:

1. Utilize read_var/write_var blocks with the processor port, although this may require a significant amount of time for programming and debugging.
2. Install a NOE module and utilize the IOScanner service for seamless communication with ModbusTCP slaves.
3. Install a NOC module for flexibility in utilizing scanner services for ModbusTCP or EtherNet/IP Class 1 communications, or both simultaneously.
4. If your processor supports CANOpen, consider using CANOpen IO modules.

Personally, I prefer option (3) as it offers versatility in handling different protocols and is considered the future-proof choice by Schneider. When it comes to IO, I tend to avoid the OTB series from Schneider due to personal preference, despite their good performance. I find other vendors' IO devices to be easier to work with. 

For third-party vendors in the network IO space, there are numerous options to explore, including Rockwell EtherNet/IP IO, Wago, Phoenix Contact, Turck, Advantech, Sixnet (Redlion), Acromag, Beckhoff, Moxa, and more. Each brand has its own strengths and advantages, so it's important to research and find the best fit for your specific needs.</p>

            <p>When comparing the use of an NOE vs. an NOC, there doesn't seem to be a clear advantage to using one over the other. Implementing Ethernet remote I/O for the M340 can be challenging if you want to mirror the same BMX I/O modules remotely as you have locally on the processor. 

I have experience using the PRA with M340, and I find it to be a unique product. It functions more like a reduced size Ethernet CPU rather than a true remote I/O adaptor. While the NOC or NOE can perform I/O scanning to the PRA, code needs to be inserted into the PRA to map the data to its I/O. Essentially, the PRA operates like a smaller-sized M340 processor, requiring a separate program file and code development to manage communications failures and shut down the I/O on the remote end if needed.

In contrast, utilizing Advantys STB Modbus TCP remote I/O has always yielded positive outcomes for me. By using default addressing for the modules and setting the IP with the role-name dhcp, the remote drop becomes easily configurable by electricians without the need for Advantys software. This flexibility has proven to be efficient and cost-effective in numerous instances.

In terms of remote device configuration, Ethernet/IP setup on an NOC module may initially present challenges compared to Rockwell. However, with some time and effort, the results can be highly effective. My personal preference leans towards using Ethernet/IP with an NOC module over the PRA, as it offers a smoother learning curve and reliable performance. Ultimately, a practical approach is to choose a solution that streamlines the installation process and minimizes the need for constant adjustments.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Corsair mentioned that there seems to be no advantage in using an NOE over an NOC in terms of Ethernet remote I/O for the M340. It can be challenging to have the same BMX I/O modules remotely as you do locally on the processor.

When working with the PRA on the M340, it becomes apparent that it is not a typical remote I/O adaptor but rather a smaller Ethernet CPU that requires its own program development, similar to the M340 Ethernet CPU. While the NOC or NOE can handle I/O scanning to the PRA, custom code needs to be implemented to map the data to its I/O. The PRA essentially functions as a scaled-down M340 processor, necessitating programming on both sides to manage communication issues and shut down remote I/O if needed. While some flexibility is offered for logic solutions at the remote end, the main advantage of the PRA is cost-effectiveness, despite potentially increasing spare parts inventory.

On the other hand, utilizing Advantys STB Modbus TCP remote I/O has yielded positive outcomes in many instances. Default addressing for the modules and role-name dhcp simplifies IP configuration, allowing electricians to make changes effortlessly without Advantys configuration software. Despite Schneider's recommendation to use their software for configuration, practical experience on numerous islands supports the efficiency and ease of using Advantys for remote I/O setups. The goal is to have a system where electricians can easily replace parts, set address switches, and commence operations without expert intervention, a task efficiently achieved by Advantys. 

Regarding Ethernet/IP setup on an NOC module, initial configuration may seem cumbersome compared to Rockwell. However, with some learning, impressive outcomes can be achieved. With a diverse mix of Schneider and AB CPUs, coupled with motor control from various manufacturers, Ethernet/IP has proven to be reliable and effective in fulfilling its promises.

In conclusion, it is advisable to forego the PRA and opt for Ethernet/IP with an NOC module. Be prepared for a reasonable learning curve in the process.</p>

            <p>According to AUTOlearner, the Pra module design is not only for PLCs like M580, Momentum, and Quantum, but can also be used with M340. Despite the outdated information, I have successfully used the PRA module with M340 in the past. Looking back, I would now recommend using a Noe (Modbus TCP/IP IO scanning) or a Noc (Ethernet IP) with remote IO from various suppliers. In my experience, I found Weidmuller's products to be the most user-friendly and easy to install.</p>
