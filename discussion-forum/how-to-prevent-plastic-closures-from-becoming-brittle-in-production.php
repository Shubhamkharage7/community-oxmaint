                    <p>Hello, we have encountered an issue with our plastic closures becoming brittle during the production process. Despite conditioning them for 48 hours at 30 degrees Celsius, we are still facing this problem. We are exploring potential solutions to maintain the elasticity of the closures, including the use of UV lights. However, after conducting research, it seems that the closures cool down and become brittle within 2 hours. If anyone has any ideas on how to address this issue, please let us know. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Ajay: Can you confirm if these plastic enclosures cool down within 2 hours? Are they manipulated after 48 hours of cooling, or do they need to wait for 48 hours before manipulation? Additionally, please specify the operations being carried out on the enclosures. Are these operations conducted at a temperature of 30C? Furthermore, can you provide details on the type of plastic used for the enclosures? Lastly, when were they first identified as brittle? Was there a modification in the process that led to this change, or have they always been prone to brittleness during this process? Have there been any improvements in throughput or changes in tooling? 
Sincerely, Howard howard@motordiagnostics.com</p>

            <p>Hello, there appears to be an issue with the turquoise closures we've been using during promotions. I've noticed that the color may be affecting the performance of the closures. To address this, I have raised the temperature in the conditioning store to 30 degrees Celsius and am closely monitoring the situation. The closures are being transferred from the hopper to the capper to seal the bottles, using the same tools which have recently shown signs of brittleness. Kind regards, Ajay.</p>
