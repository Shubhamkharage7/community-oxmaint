            <p>Hello Josh, there are various ways a system can fail. I have come across other discussions on fictitious scenarios, but I am struggling with applying the concepts to my job. I am uncertain about which reliability formula is best suited for this system. I believe Excel can help me determine the cumulative distribution function F(t) in this situation. Can you confirm if this approach is correct?</p>

            <p>In the spreadsheet attached to my previous post, I have implemented the process generator [= -MTTF.(ln(RAND())] for the exponential distribution from cell B3 to B52. This distribution accurately represents a multiple failure environment when determining observed TTF frequencies. The formula includes a parameter (the arithmetic mean) which I have set to 1,000, but it can be adjusted to suit your needs. This formula is derived using the inverse method of the general expression F(t) = 1 â€“ exp(-t/MTTF), where t is solved by setting F(t) = RAND(). 

It is worth noting that I provided an example where R(t), F(t), and MTTF were calculated from the existing data at the beginning. Contrary to my usual method, I simplified the process this time to focus on one issue at a time and avoid potential misinterpretations. Feel free to refer to my previous discussion on "Formula for MTBF" for further justification (http://maintenanceforums.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/209103451/m/6171050803).

            <p>Upon reviewing your recent post, Josh, I have realized that you were actually referring to the "functions" in columns C and D, not in column B as I initially thought. I appreciate you pointing that out, and I have made the necessary corrections in the spreadsheet. It is important to note that the values in columns C and D are not technically "functions" in a mathematical context. These values can only be interpreted numerically and displayed as empirical frequency distributions. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Best regards,</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Assis, I believe the issue lies with Excel. To clarify, when using R(t)= exp(-ÃŽÂ»), it pertains to electrical systems with a constant failure rate. On the other hand, R(t)= exp(-t/MTBF) is applicable to mechanical systems. As my system has multiple failure modes, how should I calculate R(t)? I have attached a simpler file outlining my questions.

            <p>Rui, can you please provide some clarification on the function RAND()? I understand that lambda is calculated as -ln(2A-1) multiplied by MTBF. In the formula you provided, the process generator is equal to -MTTF times ln(RAND()) for the exponential distribution. Could you confirm if RAND() is equivalent to (2A-1)? Additionally, I am curious about your typical procedure. Do you follow a constant time window and smoothing technique? Thank you for your help.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In order to calculate the expression t = -MTTF.ln(r), you can follow these steps. Start with the equation R = Exp(-t/MTTF), then proceed as follows: F = 1 - R = 1 - Exp(-t/MTTF), r = 1 - Exp(-t/MTTF), Exp(-t/MTTF) = 1 - r, Exp(t/MTTF) = 1/(1 - r), t/MTTF = ln(1/r), t = MTTF.ln(1/r), t = MTTF.[ln(1) - ln(r)], and eventually arrive at t = -MTTF.ln(r).

Regarding the formula Lambda = -ln(2A-1)*MTBF, its meaning is unclear to me. As for the time window, it can be adjusted depending on the number of statistically significant events you wish to include in your analysis. Exponential smoothing may be utilized if an indicator shows excessive variation in magnitude between periods. Ultimately, trends are crucial in effective management.

In the context of random or multiple failures in a steady state, the formula R(t) = exp(-ÃŽÂ».t) = exp(t/MTTF) is more appropriate than R(t) = exp(-ÃŽÂ»). While I have demonstrated how to calculate R(t) in a previous example, I do not consider it a useful performance indicator. Repairable systems typically rely on metrics such as MTTF, MTTR, and Availability instead of R(t). I simply presented the calculation as a demonstration, rather than as a practical indicator.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the oversight, but I should have included the definitions for the formula T=-ln(2A-1)*MTBF. In this formula, T represents the test interval needed for failure detection or detective maintenance tasks, while A stands for Mean Availability, which users typically define (e.g. 97.5% for safety purposes). It is important to note that this formula is applicable only for the exponential distribution, under the assumptions outlined in Vee's book and/or discussed within this forum.</p>
