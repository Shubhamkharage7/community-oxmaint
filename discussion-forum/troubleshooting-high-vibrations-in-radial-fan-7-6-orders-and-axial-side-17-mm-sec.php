            <p>"Upon inspection, 7.6 orders were found to match with the bearing outer race, indicating a potential fault. Even though the outer races appeared normal, there was a fault frequency with 1xSS sidebands, suggesting an outer race fault. But how was the outer race actually checked? Keep in mind that many bearings require destructive disassembly to fully assess the race surface. To avoid getting overwhelmed by data, it's important to focus on the key indicators. - Walt"</p>

            <p>I recommend using a correction pen to create markings between the bearing outer race and lower part of the housing, as well as between the bearing inner race and shaft. Run the fan for several hours, then stop to inspect the position of the marks for signs of bearing rotation within the housing. This simple method can help detect any issues with bearing movement that may occur over time.</p>

            <p>In a forum post by electricpete, it was mentioned that the inner race clearances of a bearing were measured at 0.3 mm. Can someone provide further explanation on this measurement, making sure it is clear that the clearance is between the balls and the inner ring of the bearing and not between the bearing and the shaft? Additionally, what style of bearing is being referred to in this context? Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>

            <p>Montaser recommends making marks with a correction pen between the bearing outer race and lower part of the housing, as well as between the bearing inner race and shaft. Running the fan for several hours, then stopping to inspect the marks, can help determine if the bearing is rotating inside the housing. However, opening the heavy equipment machine is currently not possible under the existing conditions. Thank you for your advice.</p>

            <p>Hey Y@SH, I reviewed the three photos you sent over. Unfortunately, none of them show the surface of the outer race/ring that comes into contact with the rollers. To accurately assess for an outer race defect, the bearing would need to be dismantled. Your current inspection, therefore, does not definitively confirm or rule out such a defect. The most effective way to determine this would involve removing the grease and dissecting the bearing rings. You can plan to do this when you replace the bearing in the future. If you did replace the bearing in the photos you shared, you could dissect the old bearing for a thorough inspection. Keep this in mind for future reference. Thanks, Walt.</p>
