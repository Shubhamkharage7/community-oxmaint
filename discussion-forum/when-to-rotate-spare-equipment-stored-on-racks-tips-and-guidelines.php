            <p>Hello Colin, while I cannot provide a specific recipe, there are some key principles to keep in mind when storing rotor shafts. 

1. For slender shafts stored horizontally, it is crucial to turn the rotors to prevent any potential issues. If vertical storage is an option, that is the preferred method. Ideally, a 270-degree rotation is recommended, with the frequency depending on the shaft's slenderness. Typically, shafts should be turned every 3 to 6 months.

2. When dealing with large rotors like those found in steam and gas turbines, vertical storage is best. If vertical storage is not possible, consider rotating the rotors every 2 months. Additionally, storing them in a container filled with dry nitrogen at a specific water column pressure can help maintain their condition.

3. Motor shafts are usually quite sturdy and may not require frequent turning. However, if there are concerns about their stiffness or weight, it is advisable to turn them over every 6 months.

4. It is important to incorporate these maintenance practices into your CMMS to ensure they are consistently implemented and not forgotten.

5. When storing rotors vertically, it is essential to ensure they are truly vertical, either by hanging freely or placing them in a designated container. Avoid resting the shaft end at an angle against a rack or wall.

These tips will help maintain the quality and longevity of your rotor shafts. Thank you, V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>In a recent email response, Paul Barringer Colin recommended ReliabilityWeb.com as a valuable source of information. Terry O'Hanlon, in particular, offers a wealth of knowledge on the topic. For further reading, check out the recommended reading list at http://www.barringer1.com/read.htm, which includes the Nonoperating Reliability Databook from RAC. This resource highlights the importance of regular maintenance for equipment that is not in operation to prevent corrosion and false brinnelling of bearing surfaces.

It is crucial to regularly activate pumps, motors, and other machinery even when not in use to avoid potential issues during startup and shutdown. Written procedures and frequent drills are essential to ensure operators are prepared and avoid MTBSE (Mean Time Between Stupid Equipment).

Discipline in conducting exercises is key, with well-disciplined plants scheduling exercises every 1-2 months, while others may need to schedule them every 1-2 weeks. Ultimately, proper installation and usage practices greatly impact the lifespan of equipment both in storage and during operation.

            <p>To effectively manage rotor mass, it is essential to regularly maintain antifriction bearings to prevent them from seizing up. This ensures that both the fixed and floating bearings remain at the proper tension. Implementing a small motor to power a gearbox with an output of approximately 5 RPM can be a practical solution. By arranging multiple motors in a row and connecting them with a chain drive of 50 motors, you can efficiently lubricate the bearings. Setting a timer to run the system for 5 minutes a day, or even twice a day, will help prevent false brinelling by ensuring the bearings are properly lubricated and protected.</p>
