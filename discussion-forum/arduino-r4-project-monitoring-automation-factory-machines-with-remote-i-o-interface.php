                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings, I am embarking on a project to develop a machine monitoring system for an automation factory during my internship. The project involves utilizing the Arduino unit to interface remote I/O and display the status of on/off and running time. While this may seem straightforward initially, as someone with limited experience in PLC, I find it quite challenging. Despite conducting online research for similar projects, I have been unable to find relevant information. Therefore, I am reaching out for guidance and assistance. I welcome any suggestions and constructive feedback. I will also provide updates on the progress of the project. My current plan is to connect the Arduino R4 to the same wifi network as the remote I/O and interface the units using their IP addresses. This should allow me to access and monitor the machines' status data. Initially, I intend to use Arduino.json to compile and store the data, which will be displayed in the serial monitor as a first milestone. I would appreciate any advice on my approach and welcome additional ideas. Thank you for your support.</p>

            <p>Which brand and model of PLC is being used in this scenario? What communication interfaces and protocols can be used to retrieve data from the PLC? Would you prefer the PLC to transmit data to the Arduino, or would you like the Arduino to request data from the PLC (both options are possible)? What is the operating system on the R4 platform?</p>

            <p>Are you using a PLC with wifi capabilities and if so, which brand? I have successfully used a MODBUS TCP library on my Arduino to connect to various industrial devices, with great results. Typically, I use a UNO R3 or a MEGA with an ethernet shield, but the new R4 model with built-in wifi should provide a similar experience.</p>

            <p>DuckDuckGo noted that while it may seem simple at first, for someone unfamiliar with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), it can be quite a daunting task. Get ready for a learning journey as there is a lot to learn in this field.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>WhinnieThePooh inquired about using a PLC with wifi, asking about the preferred brand. With a MODBUS TCP library available for Arduino, interfacing with industrial devices has been smooth and effective. While traditionally using a UNO R3 or a MEGA with an ethernet shield, the built-in wifi feature of the R4 presents a similar setup. 

An update on the Modbus library is crucial for compatibility with the R4. Despite the board's potential, it lacks an RTC crystal upon shipping. Additionally, the WiFi library requires a rewrite for asynchronous operation, potentially necessitating custom firmware on the ESP. Current networking activities on the board are blocking by default, leading to delays and interference with IO and serial timing.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>JeremyM inquired about the status of the Modbus library update for the R4. While the board shows potential, it lacks an RTC crystal and the current WiFi library requires modification to function asynchronously. This may necessitate custom firmware on the ESP to effectively handle various protocols. Presently, the board's network and web server operations are hindered by blocking behavior, causing delays in unrelated IO and serial timing. This issue came as a surprise to me, as I have not yet purchased an R4 and now question whether it is the right choice for my project. Aside from the Nano 33 IoT, my experience with Arduino WiFi boards has been limited as I typically work with ethernet connections.</p>
