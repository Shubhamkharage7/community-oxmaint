            <p>Could you please indicate the measurement points on the compressor image? Do you have any historical data on measurements (trend, cascade)? In the meantime, I will provide some insights on the motor side. The vibration levels have increased, but they do not appear to be critical. The higher levels are likely due to residual unbalance. You observed harmonics of 100.3 Hz at the NDE motor side. While you suspect Broken Rotor Bars (BSF), I lean towards the 2x Line Frequency (2xLF), which is common at the NDE side of motors. A higher resolution could provide a more precise answer. There is a small difference between 100.0 and 100.3 Hz, which could be attributed to the input and actual rpm. However, the amplitudes are currently not critical, so I would assess the motor's condition as non-critical.</p>

            <p>Upon initial inspection of the spectrum, it appears there may be a misalignment issue present. This can be confirmed by examining the phases of each side of the coupling. If you are unsure about the drawing you are referencing, I recommend checking the clearance of the bearings on both the motor and compressor sides. A substantial difference in the input shaft measurements between the motor and compressor could indicate a misalignment, as evidenced by high readings of 1x, 2x, and 3x, among others. Best regards,</p>
