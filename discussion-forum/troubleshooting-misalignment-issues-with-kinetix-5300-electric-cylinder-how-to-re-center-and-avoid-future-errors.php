                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings PLCS.Net Forum! This is my first time posting, and I consider myself a novice in this field. I am encountering a crucial issue where my servo/linear piston is not correctly zeroed, causing a discrepancy between the actual physical position (47 mm) and the perceived position in Studio 5000 V35 (32 mm). This discrepancy poses a significant risk of mechanical damage.

The equipment involved includes an A2198-C1004-ERS KINETIX 5300 servo driving an MPAIA3076RM14AMP series heavy-duty electric cylinder with a total range of 76 mm. The feedback and power/brake cables are new (2090-CPBM7DF-16AA033 m Power/Brake & 2090-CFBM7DF-CEAA033 m Feedback), and other hardware includes a 5069-L306ERM CompactLogix and a 2711P-T7C22D8S PanelView Plus 7.

The piston controls the spacing of grind wheels, with soft limits set at 32mm and 58mm, and a home position at 34 mm. The HMI provides specific recipes for selected positions that the servo should reach and hold with a brake until a different recipe is chosen.

While initial programming tests were successful manually, I am now facing difficulties automating functions like moving to the home position or selected recipe locations. I have attempted to rezero the drive/piston but have encountered limitations within the controller tags.

I am seeking advice on how to restore/rezero my drive/piston alignment and prevent such issues in the future. Is there a way to avoid errors caused by code or power cycles? Am I misunderstanding absolute encoding and its ability to track position accurately?

Additionally, I am considering adding limit switches for extra protection and would appreciate recommendations on sensor types and homing sequence tips. My goal is to achieve precision within 0.1 mm tolerance without introducing errors from sensor resolution.

Thank you in advance for any guidance or insights you can provide.
Warm regards,OhNo!</p>

            <p>Explore the MAH instruction for Motion Axis Home. You have the option to home to a hard stop (consider limiting torque during this process) or home to a limit switch. The instruction also enables you to apply an offset. Additionally, you can utilize an SSV to reconfigure zero, although it may require some time to familiarize yourself with the process. Based on my own findings, homing to a hard stop at a low velocity with restricted torque has yielded optimal outcomes. It is highly recommended to refer to Rockwell's comprehensive documentation on servo programming for further guidance and clarity on any queries you may have. Downloading and thoroughly reading the documentation will provide you with valuable insights.</p>

            <p>When setting up your motion control system, it's important to follow the MAH (Motion Axis Home) instruction carefully. You have the option to home to a hard stop with limited torque or to a limit switch, and can also apply an offset if needed. Consider using an SSV to redefine 0 as well. From my experience, homing to a hard stop at low velocity yields the best results. It's recommended to refer to Rockwell's servo programming documentation for detailed guidance. By downloading and reading these manuals, you'll find answers to all your programming questions. Don't hesitate to explore specific programming manuals for further insights. Cheers! --OhNo!</p>

            <p>Do absolute encoders maintain their position for the full 4,096 turns inside the piston? Absolutely! At some point, a reference point needs to be established to define zero position on the axis in terms of encoder turns and counts. This relationship between motor turns and displacement in millimeters is a key aspect of the drivetrain mechanism in Studio 5000. One common method for establishing this zero point is using a physical switch that triggers when the mechanism reaches a "home" position. There are various approaches to handling this, such as stopping when the switch is activated and defining that as zero, or moving in reverse at a slow speed until the switch is released and then setting that as zero. Some mechanisms allow for a "home to hard stop" function, where the motor's torque is reduced and the mechanism is moved until it hits an end stop and detects an increase in current without a change in position.

ControlLogix does not have a built-in home-to-hard-stop function, but some A-B branded indexing drives offer this feature. Setting the "home" or "zero" position of the axis is typically accomplished using the Motion Axis Home (MAH) instruction. This can be done through the Axis Properties menu by selecting the Homing window, setting the Sequence to Immediate, and clicking Apply. Alternatively, the MAH instruction can be executed in the user program with the arguments configured in the Axis settings.

It's important to differentiate between Active + Immediate and Passive homing methods. Active + Immediate immediately sets the axis position to the specified value on the Homing screen, while Passive homing relies on a Z-pulse signal once per revolution for accuracy, often used for feedback-only axes that move freely.</p>

            <p>When setting up your system, it is essential to consider how it operates daily and how alignment is achieved during assembly or maintenance. Without an encoder or motor, determining the position of the grind wheels can be a challenge. Do you rely on a probe, switch, scale, or a laser tracker to measure against fixed frame parts? The absence of sensors or verification poses a risk of unauthorized adjustments or incorrect resets, leading to malfunctions. One approach is to align the machine using your preferred method and input the position for the Active/Immediate Home feature with the MAH. For precise homing functions, using accurate sensors and going at a slow pace is recommended. A limit switch or proximity sensor with Passive Homing can also be utilized to set the zero point for the Axis. To ensure accuracy, comparing the system's actual position with what the Axis indicates and applying any discrepancies as an offset is advisable.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum community! Let's talk about the Axis tag. You mentioned the "linear_piston.ActualPosition" tag is Read-Only, which it indeed is. This tag provides the axis position based on encoder counts after scaling factors are applied in the Scaling tab for the Axis. Here, you input details like power transmission type, reducer ratio, inches/rev, and soft travel limits.

If you need to temporarily adjust the Axis location, you can use the Motion Redefine Position (MRP) instruction. This allows you to input a tag value or literal argument to update the Command or Actual position of the axis, even while it's in motion. It's useful for making adjustments, indexing, and synchronization.

However, it's important to note that MRP does not alter the Axis encoder relationship. After a power cycle, the Axis position will revert to the absolute encoder's count value and saved offset from the last Home function performed with MAH or by clicking Apply on the Homing page for the Axis.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I want to express my gratitude for the insightful responses. There is a lot for me to delve into and consider. After finishing this post, I am eager to start reading the programming manual mentioned earlier. Despite reading numerous technical manuals for this project, it seems I may have overlooked the key ones.

Regarding absolute encoding, does it track its position accurately for the full 4,096 turns within the piston? Indeed, it does! Can you elaborate more on this? If it is certain of its position, what could have gone wrong? Could it be that I have simply redefined the zero point for the drive, while the encoder count remains absolute? I will carefully study the MAH command for clarification.

At some stage, it is crucial to establish how many absolute encoder turns and counts correspond to the "zero" position on the axis. Knowing that -1192.46 equals zero, is there a way to revert back to the original specifications permanently (not just temporarily as per the MRP instruction)? Alternatively, some systems are suited for "homing to a hard stop," which might be beneficial for this scenario. The brake should maintain the piston's position during operation, with friction being the primary load during MAM. I will attempt to limit the maximum torque to 1-2%, as speed is not a primary concern. Even a speed of 3 mm/s is deemed sufficient. Additionally, I am contemplating incorporating sensors for travel limits.

Typically, setting the "home" or "zero" position of the axis is accomplished using the Motion Axis Home (MAH) instruction. It seems I may have misconstrued the MAH command, leading to my current situation. Everything was functioning well until I utilized that command.

Thank you for the valuable contributions! I am truly grateful. I have been following this forum on and off for years, and I am excited to finally be actively participating. I will provide further updates once I have more information to share.

Best regards,
OhNo!</p>

            <p>Hello everyone,

Upon watching a YouTube video by aMAH, I realized my misunderstanding of the "Position" parameter in the drive configuration's Homing tab. I mistakenly set it to 32 mm, expecting the MAH to move the piston to that exact position. However, this led to an error where the MAH incorrectly reported the piston's position as 32 mm when it was actually at 48 mm, causing a discrepancy of 16 mm and a potential crash risk. The video snippet at 3:54 provides an explanation of key homing parameters.

To rectify this issue temporarily, I plan to:

1. Determine the actual position of the piston
2. Input this measurement into the Position parameter
3. Run the MAH once to redefine and correct the system's position

I will also consider removing this function from my code until I have proper homing sensors in place and a better understanding of the MAH instructions. Alternatively, for non-traditional homing sequences where I simply need to move the piston to a "Home-like" position, I can utilize MAM and specify the target position or use a designated Tag such as piston_retracted_pos.

I appreciate any assistance and hope that my experience can prevent similar mistakes for others in the future.

Best regards,
OhNo!</p>
