            <p>Thank you for your input, Heposlamos. I find your list to be quite practical. In my opinion, the key lies not in what data is collected, but in the reasons behind it. It is essential for performance measures to align with the desired behaviors. I noticed a lack of KPIs related to availability, utilization, and reliability. While I assume these metrics are being collected, they were not included in the list for some reason. The primary goal of the plant is to ensure efficient transportation of goods, which is facilitated by high availability and utilization. When assessing utilization, it is crucial to identify different types of losses, such as those due to preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, and expected failures. Additionally, it is important to distinguish between losses that could have been prevented through proper maintenance practices. In a few days, I will be presenting an iPresentation on ReliabilityWeb.com to delve deeper into these systems. I will share the link on this forum once it is ready for viewing. 

On a related note, I observed that you are tracking scheduled services and executed services. It is imperative not to blindly follow vendor-recommended schedules for all equipment, as they are often overly conservative. Achieving 100% compliance with such schedules can result in unnecessary time and money wastage. To determine the optimal maintenance approach, a detailed analysis is required to distinguish between conservative and accurate recommendations. I hope this information proves useful.

            <p>Hello Steeve, I wanted to let you know that the KPIs you mentioned are already in use within my department. These include MTTF, MTBF, MKBF (mean kilometer between failures), MTTR, availability, failure ratio, and utilization. However, I am unsure about how to specifically measure PM performance, as these metrics typically relate to CM and planning rather than PM alone. A friend suggested calculating the non-conformity ratio on the PM checklist to gauge PM performance. Can you confirm if this method is accurate? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>I am optimistic that my presentation on iPresentation will be released tomorrow. While adhering to project management standards and checklists is important, many checklists are outdated and ineffective, leading to potential miscommunication or embarrassment for managers when attempting to enforce strict compliance. Before implementing any changes, it is essential to review project management procedures and checklists using a robust decision-making process like RCM, involving a team of operators, technicians, and OEMs. Additionally, I am curious to know if you utilize an automated system for gathering field availability data.

            <p>Haytam, Could you provide more specifics about your role within the mining department? Are you responsible for managing mobile equipment performance metrics such as MTBF, MTTR, and utilization? Is your work focused on underground mining operations, and if so, what specific resources are being extracted? Are you involved in the mining of precious metals like gold, silver, or copper? Looking forward to hearing more details. Regards, Rolly Angeles, Educator.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are some key performance indicators (KPIs) commonly used to measure the effectiveness of preventive maintenance in mining fleets?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Common KPIs for assessing preventive maintenance effectiveness in mining fleets include fleet uptime percentage, mean time between failures (MTBF), maintenance cost per unit, equipment availability, and planned vs. unplanned maintenance ratio.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can fleet uptime percentage be calculated and why is it an important KPI for preventive maintenance assessment?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Fleet uptime percentage is calculated by dividing the total operating time by the total scheduled time. It is an important KPI as it reflects the reliability and availability of mining fleet equipment after preventive maintenance activities.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What is the significance of mean time between failures (MTBF) as a KPI for preventive maintenance in mining fleets?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - MTBF is a crucial KPI that indicates the average time elapsed between equipment failures. A higher MTBF value suggests better reliability and efficiency of preventive maintenance practices in mining fleets.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. How does monitoring maintenance cost per unit help in assessing the effectiveness of preventive maintenance in mining fleets?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Tracking maintenance cost per unit assists in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of preventive maintenance activities. A decrease in this KPI over time indicates improved maintenance efficiency and reduced operational expenses.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 5. Why is it important to analyze the ratio of planned vs. unplanned maintenance when evaluating preventive maintenance in mining fleets?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The planned vs. unplanned maintenance ratio helps in understanding the proportion of maintenance activities that were scheduled (preventive</p>
