                    <p>Hi there, I'm currently using cimplicity workbench and have successfully made changes to the project on this machine before. However, upon logging into the project today and attempting to access the dynamic feature, I encountered a pop-up message stating "project configured to broadcast, but not being received." I suspect the machine may have become disconnected from the network. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Dylan Beg inquired about a problem with Cimplicity Workbench: while making changes to a project from their current machine, they encountered an error message when trying to access the dynamic feature. The message indicated that the project was configured to broadcast but not being received. It is suspected that the machine may have been disconnected from the network. Any advice on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Another individual experiencing the same problem seeks a solution. Any updates on this issue?</p>
