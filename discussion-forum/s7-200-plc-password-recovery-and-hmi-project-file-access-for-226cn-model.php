            <p>Unauthorized access to password-protected systems, commonly referred to as "breaking passwords" or using "back-door" methods, is prohibited on this forum. If you have legally obtained rights to access a certain application, it is recommended that you contact the equipment manufacturer for project recovery assistance. However, some manufacturers may still be unable to grant access even with valid documentation.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response and assistance. I want to clarify that the machine in question is not a clone, but rather one that I personally purchased from a Chinese manufacturer. I have the legal rights to obtain a backup of the software or the password for it. Unfortunately, this issue caused a breakdown in my production line. I have reached out to the manufacturer, who claims they are not aware of any password or issue. I have resolved the issue by clearing the CPU and reprogramming the PLC and HMI.

            <p>I appreciate everyone's adherence to the forum rules. In situations like this, it's understandable that one would be desperate for a solution. However, it's important for Siemens to address this issue and understand that the PLC is not a cloned version, as it was manufactured under Siemens' license in China, similar to Omron, SEW, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, etc. I have taken all legal steps by clearing and reprogramming the program, although it was time-consuming due to the complexity of the project. Thank you all for your support. Best regards.</p>

Although some models do not bear the 'CN' label in the part number, indicating different versions for China and other markets.

            <p>According to geniusintraining, Siemens' current product lineup largely originates from China. The 200 and 1200 series PLCs are examples of products now manufactured in China. However, recent developments suggest that Siemens has relocated the manufacturing of their PLCs back to Germany in response to competition in EU projects that require products to be made within the EU. 

Regarding password-protected programs, they can be a hassle. While they secure the intellectual property of the programmer, they also necessitate maintenance services from the programmer. This type of arrangement may not be sustainable for some businesses, as it limits flexibility and control. Ultimately, the decision to use password-protected programs depends on individual needs and preferences.</p>

            <p>Balash suggested that the manufacturing of their PLCs was brought back to Germany due to competition in EU projects, as EU regulations require products to be made within the EU. Time will tell if this decision pays off. Many of the 200's and 1200's in Balash's possession were manufactured in China in late 2014, while all of their HMIs are still produced in Germany.</p>
