                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, Our team successfully installed the girth gear on the ball mill. Initially, all measurements were perfect in cold conditions. However, once the ball mill started operating, the temperatures of both the mill and gear increased, causing the girth gear joints to slightly open up. This issue is likely due to pitch errors between the two girth gear halves resulting from temperature fluctuations. How can we address this problem effectively?</p>

            <p>Are you installing a new girth gear system? It's important to carefully bolt together the segments to prevent shocks during operation. Consider using a high-strength anaerobic thread locker like Locktite for secure assembly. Grade 8 Allen head cap screws are recommended over grade 5 bolts, with torque values adjusted accordingly. Use hardened washers to prevent distortion and ensure a durable connection. For long-lasting results, opt for grade 8 fasteners that can be lock-wired. Manufacturers may advise re-torquing bolts periodically and using lock-wire for added security. Remember to replace bolts and washers with each disassembly of an overhauled machine to maintain proper functionality. Avoid reusing bolts to prevent potential issues down the line.</p>
