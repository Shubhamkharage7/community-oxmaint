            <p>Developing clear plant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) upfront is crucial for a successful rollout. Instead of piecing them together slowly, it's important to define these KPIs clearly from the start. This will help your plant focus on gaining acceptance from all stakeholders through regular, monthly presentations.</p>

            <p>"Josh suggested that your plant should clearly define its key plant performance indicators (KPIs) upfront to ensure a cohesive rollout. By presenting these KPIs to stakeholders regularly, such as on a monthly basis, your plant can ensure buy-in and alignment. Although I utilized KPIs a decade ago, my company's collaboration with another plant necessitates a realignment of KPI definitions and equations."</p>

            <p>Perhaps it's time to organize a synergistic team event to align on standard KPI definitions. Do you have a designated champion leading your plant's KPI reporting initiatives?</p>

            <p>Quote: Josh suggests having a synergy away day to standardize KPI definitions in order to align processes, procedures, organization, reporting, and KPIs. It is important to have a champion for your plant KPI reporting program. Prior to synergy, team building events are typically held, but post-synergy, there is a focus on alignment. One challenge that arises is discrepancies in reporting and KPI definitions between different teams. This can lead to confusion, especially when some KPIs have similar descriptions but vary in the equation used to calculate them.</p>
