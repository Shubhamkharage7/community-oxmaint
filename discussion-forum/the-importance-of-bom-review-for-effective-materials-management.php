            <p>Discover the Key to Unlocking Maximum Savings in MRO Inventory Control BOMs

"The Missing Tool of MRO Inventory Control BOMs â€“ A Model for Savings" by Bob DiStefano, MRG, was originally presented at the Computerized Maintenance Management Summit. MRG has highlighted the potential for significant savings in MRO inventory, up to 50% of its value. The actual savings percentage depends on the effectiveness of the plant's MRO BOM program, inventory management practices, and maintenance reliability system.

Research by MRG shows that MRO BOMs contribute an average of 30% to total savings. By utilizing MRO BOMs, plants can eliminate obsolete spare parts, optimize stocking levels by accurately forecasting part needs, and reduce duplicate parts. This leads to direct inventory savings and also positively impacts maintenance labor and equipment downtime.

Implementing MRO BOMs can result in labor savings of up to 15%, as craftsmen spend less time searching for parts. These saved hours can be reinvested in preventive maintenance programs, yielding further savings over time. Additionally, the reduction in equipment downtime through quick part location and proper part installation can lead to savings benchmarked at 3.5%.

One of the key benefits of accurate MRO BOMs is quality assurance in maintenance repairs, especially in regulated industries like nuclear power and pharmaceuticals. By minimizing the risk of installing incorrect parts, MRO BOMs enhance equipment reliability and reduce the potential for catastrophic failures.

The attached PDF provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of MRO BOMs on inventory control and operational efficiency. Harness the power of MRO BOMs to optimize your inventory management practices and drive substantial cost savings in your maintenance operations.</p>

            <p>When it comes to selecting spare parts for daily maintenance and turnaround planning, there are several key points to consider for an efficient and streamlined process. It is crucial to ensure that spare parts are easily and quickly accessible from the BOM, with correct specifications in order to expedite the purchasing process. Additionally, evaluating spare part interchangeability can help optimize inventory levels and reduce lead times. Reviewing stock minimum and maximum levels is essential for efficient inventory management, as well as determining which equipment should be kept in stock. It's important to note that these improvements are building upon an existing foundation, rather than starting from scratch.</p>

            <p>When presenting ideas to senior management, it is crucial to clearly demonstrate the cause and effect relationship. For instance, ensuring that spare parts meet specifications and streamlining the purchasing process has a direct impact on our bottom line. It is important to address the current problem or cost implications, estimate potential savings, consider any drawbacks, and outline the expected costs and timeline of implementation. By anticipating and addressing these questions proactively, in a language that resonates with decision-makers, and highlighting the clear cost benefits, you increase the chances of approval. The actual cost may not be the primary concern as long as the benefits far outweigh it and there is a strong possibility of realizing those benefits. I will work on preparing a comprehensive proposal addressing these points promptly. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about potential drawbacks, cost, and timeline for reaping benefits is crucial when considering a new initiative. In my experience, a common concern raised by higher management is identifying who will take charge of the implementation process. As my boss once emphasized, having innovative ideas is one thing, but taking on the accountability for execution is what truly sets individuals apart. To ensure success, it's essential to not just say "I want to make changes," but to actually take the necessary steps to make it happen. By displaying a willingness to take on responsibilities, opportunities will arise and doors will open for progress.</p>

            <p>When it comes to updating your Bill of Materials (BOM), it can be advantageous to consider purchasing a sub assembly as a repair kit.

            <p>Wouldn't it make more sense to claim that Bill of Materials (BOMs) can reduce the reliance on existing knowledge by the Planner/Supervisor? Many Maintenance departments struggle with turnover, leading to challenges with new staff adapting to established systems. Having BOMs in place provides a solid foundation for newcomers to start with. This shifts the focus of planning from understanding the production system to mastering the CMMS system. By organizing knowledge into a structured format through BOMs, clarity and comprehension are enhanced. Just like engineers need drawings for effective communication, BOMs provide a vital reference point for Purchasing (streamlining vendor searches), Maintenance (efficient part identification), Planning (task organization), and Mechanics/E&I (having the right parts). If advocating for BOMs alone isn't enough, consider consulting with a reliable RCM provider for additional support in presenting compelling justifications to upper management. While we recognize the inherent value of BOMs, our expertise lies in implementation rather than sales tactics.</p>

            <p>Wouldn't it be easier to argue that Bill of Materials (BOMs) can streamline processes and reduce the dependence on the knowledge of supervisors and planners? While I appreciate technology, I believe that BOMs cannot entirely replace the expertise of supervisors and planners. Are we ready to task entry-level employees with navigating a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), accessing drawings, and pulling up BOMs? This includes mechanics and fitters. Even if we consider sharing this knowledge widely to potentially cut the need for supervisors and planners, these roles will still be essential for higher-level operations. The idea of replacing supervisors and planners with BOMs to cut costs may not be as effective in reality.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by svanels: Despite being a huge computer enthusiast, I believe that a Bill of Materials (BOM) cannot completely replace a supervisor or planner. The idea of replacing a supervisor or planner with a BOM to save on costs is not a viable strategy. The knowledge possessed by experienced supervisors and planners is unique to them and holds significant value in understanding the Maintenance Department and operations. This knowledge should be preserved rather than eliminated. The transition of knowledge between staff can be facilitated by utilizing BOMs, PMs, work scheduling processes, historical data in the CMMS, etc. This ensures that essential knowledge is not lost during staff changes. Supervisors and planners play a crucial role in a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) environment and should continue to hold their positions without being replaced.</p>

            <p>I fully understand the importance of concrete data and agree that accountability is necessary for any project. However, I feel compelled to point out some practical considerations. Just like how most restaurants have detailed recipes to manage costs, shouldn't businesses also have a Bill of Materials (BOM) for the products they sell? Similarly, auto repair shops and dealers rely on BOMs to quickly provide accurate pricing for repairs. It only makes sense for companies to have BOMs for their products to ensure cost accuracy and analyze any discrepancies. Taking it a step further, in the context of maintenance and reliability, shouldn't we also have a BOM for the capacity we create for our organization? These thoughts were inspired by Mark Goldstein.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am employed at a cement plant where I recently conducted a comparison between direct purchase and catalogued items. With over 5000 work orders per year and 10,000 catalogued items in SAP (both stocked and non-stocked), I observed that maintainers were unnecessarily purchasing items that were already in stock. By incorporating the most frequently purchased items into the SAP catalog, we were able to save approximately 9 man-weeks per year and increase tool efficiency. Cataloguing items also provides a valuable movement history compared to direct purchases. The challenge lies in the difficulty of finding items due to differences in naming conventions. I believe enhancing the Bill of Materials (BOMs) is essential for improving tool efficiency. Transitioning from functional location to equipment BOMs can streamline the process, especially for items used at multiple locations within the plant. To optimize BOMs in SAP, I am considering mirroring the item listings from OEM documentation to help maintainers easily locate the correct parts. This strategy aims to prevent BOM lists from becoming overwhelming and ensure a more efficient maintenance process. I welcome any suggestions on how to effectively configure BOMs for maximum efficiency. Thank you, James.</p>

            <p>Josh's plant has undergone a 25-year transformation, transitioning from an old paper system to a software with character limits and finally to SAP for accounting purposes and maintenance tracking. The legacy data in SAP requires extensive refinement and correction, which can be a time-consuming task. Contract cataloguers may not always guarantee a superior job, but MITs provide additional benefits by enabling comprehensive word and text searches throughout the MM data, as well as facilitating multiple selection searches.

It is crucial to follow strict guidelines when cataloguing spare parts according to their part description and model number. Different technical terms may be used for the same part, such as shaft encoder, tacho (meter), encoder, and speed sensor, posing a challenge for cataloguers. Maintainers should not have free rein to use any words in the 40 character BOM text, as the same part may serve different purposes in other contexts.

The current issue of the BOM 40 character text appearing on purchase orders needs to be addressed, with efforts being made to ensure that only the relevant PO text is displayed. Guidelines for the BOM 40 character text should be established, particularly when describing complex assemblies like a control valve complete with an actuator and positioner controller. In terms of BOMs, considerations should be given to the placement of item numbers and how to handle greyed-out fields.

Overall, it is important to maintain consistency and accuracy in cataloguing practices to ensure efficient maintenance operations.</p>

It's crucial to unlock the greyed-out fields and customize your transactions in order to maximize their effectiveness. Are you primarily focused on materials or maintenance tasks? How long have you been working with SAP? The challenges you're facing may be more about implementation than the system's functionalities.

            <p>Effective management of Bill of Materials (BOMs) requires a comprehensive understanding of parts manuals and general equipment and parts knowledge. A reliable CMMS should include a feature to associate parts with specific equipment, considering that a single part may be sourced from various suppliers. A comprehensive cross-reference table is essential for streamlined operations. It is crucial to view a BOM project not as an isolated task, but as an ongoing process that occurs whenever equipment undergoes maintenance. Equipment parts manuals typically provide an exploded view with numbered parts, making it easier to identify components.

While some parts may only be available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), there are several generic alternatives that can be purchased at a lower cost from other suppliers. OEM references are usually the primary source for parts, though they may not always provide detailed information such as specific bearing types. Some components, like pilot bearings, may not be documented at all. Verification through physical inspection using tools like calipers and a loupe is often necessary to identify and source these parts accurately.

Grease and oil seals are other components that can pose challenges. In some cases, expensive seals from the OEM can be replaced with more affordable options found elsewhere. For example, a set of Viton seals costing $80 each from the pump manufacturer could be sourced for just $15, provided the dimensions are accurately specified after direct contact with the seal supplier. This highlights the importance of thorough research and verification when managing equipment maintenance and parts sourcing.</p>

            <p>I have experience in IT, which is why I am reaching out on this forum. I have experimented with fields but not much to do. We typically store our drawings in a Notes database for better functionality. As an engineer, I am interested in how you set up your BOM with multiple entries for matching OEM part IDs or positional numbers. It is crucial to insist on documentation standards for BOM data and generics when dealing with vendors to ensure accuracy and cost control. I have encountered challenges with European suppliers changing tags on valves, causing issues with replacement parts. Persistence is key in such situations. Gathering data for VA CM activities can provide valuable information for bearing and gearing data. It is important to flag items stocked in the store and properly identify them upon arrival.

            <p>Using Material BOMs within Equipment/Equipment BOMs allows for the grouping of parts, facilitating easier access for tradesmen. For example, a pump equipment may have separate material BOMs for pump parts and seal parts. An additional advantage is the ability to link material BOMs to multiple technical objects, streamlining the process for managing the same model pump across various plant locations. The Sort String field includes the part/item number referenced on OEM parts drawings. This system enhances organization and efficiency in maintenance operations.</p>

            <p>When it comes to purchasing parts, it's essential to consider cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality standards. Often, buying departments may opt for OEM parts, which tend to be pricier than alternatives available from various vendors. However, it's crucial for them to be aware of the interchangeability of spare parts and the options available from different suppliers. One way to tackle this issue is by not specifying a manufacturer for commonly interchangeable items in the BOM, reserving such details for proprietary components. This decision can be challenging for engineers tasked with identifying these interchangeable parts. Collaboration between maintenance and procurement departments can help in making informed decisions about materials and sourcing alternatives to OEM parts.</p>
