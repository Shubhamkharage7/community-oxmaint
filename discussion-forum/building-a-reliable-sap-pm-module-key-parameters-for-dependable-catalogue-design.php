            <p>What type of reliability analysis are you looking to conduct? Which SAP data do you review to implement continuous improvement? I am intrigued as to what reporting methods are utilized by those utilizing the iso 14224 standard. Is anyone on this forum experienced in exporting SAP data to OREDA?</p>

            <p>Incorporating ISO14224 for establishing a comprehensive catalog profile is essential for industries, like oil & gas, to collect reliable data for maintenance and reliability analysis. Reporting to OREDA is not required to utilize ISO14224 effectively. A well-formulated catalog profile is crucial for ensuring accurate data collection and analysis. Remember, the quality of data input directly impacts the output, so starting with a well-thought-out catalog profile is key.</p>

            <p>ISO14224 serves as a guideline for gathering information effectively to enhance reliability studies. Organizations should prioritize specific reliability parameters based on business needs. For new construction projects, engineering information should be accompanied by failure-cause and resolution data for analysis. Catalogue profiles assist in classifying failure causes to improve overall reliability. Ultimately, reliable statistics rely on accurate data to inform engineering decisions.</p>

            <p>In the past, we would assess MTBF and in certain instances MTTF. The failure rate, which can be tracked and monitored through the mean, is similar to MTBF. It is important to have a clear definition of machine availability and machine train availability. Utilizing the design catalogue profile in SAP (failure-object-resolution) allows for the identification and analysis of failure modes.</p>

            <p>Certainly. By designing a comprehensive catalogue profile, you can effectively document failures for each mode and equipment. From there, you can analyze trends in equipment failure rates by class and calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) easily. I suggest giving it a try. In the meantime, I will work on creating an Excel spreadsheet that I can share with you. I am currently occupied, but I will make an effort to find some time. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I recently located this page after a prolonged search. Although I haven't had the opportunity to work on an Excel sheet yet, I am committed to providing you with accurate information to the best of my ability. For practical examples, in a catalogue profile, you can specify the object, failure mode, probable cause, and resolution. From what I understand, MTBF data is accessible in SAP, allowing you to obtain MTBF information directly if the input is accurate. You may need to verify whether this feature is enabled in your environment. For PM Frequency details, you can refer to the Maintenance item/Maintenance Plan in SAP to view the frequencies and different time horizons set for specific equipment. It is possible to utilize IP41/42/17/18 for this purpose.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When collecting data, it is crucial to consider how you plan to utilize it. Will you simply store it on servers to produce reports, or will you integrate it with a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) approach for ongoing enhancements? If you opt for the latter, it's essential to select systems that can support continuous improvement throughout the lifespan of your assets. Many companies struggle to maintain an RCM strategy as assets evolve and the strategy becomes outdated, often due to the complexity and resource-intensive nature of updating it. Imagine if your maintenance strategy was based on SAP data? By integrating an RCM system with SAP, you can identify failure causes in catalog profiles, link these causes to maintenance tasks, and analyze notifications for corrective work to ensure the strategy remains effective or requires adjustments. This streamlined process promotes continuous reliability enhancements and transforms data into actionable insights for informed decision-making. Remember, SAP is merely a database! If you're interested in a live demonstration of this solution with SAP, please reach out to me.</p>

            <p>To access Mean Time Between Repairs (MTBR) data in SAP, navigate through the following path: Logistics > Plant maintenance > Information system > Report selection > Information systems. Here, you can find both MTTR and MTBR for Equipment and Functional locations using transaction codes MCJB and MCJC.</p>

            <p>Hello Probin, I have already taken that route before. However, it seems that I may not have full access to the report. Can you please advise on the necessary inputs to configure in SAP in order to generate a report on MTTR/MTBR? You mentioned transferring the same data to an Excel sheet. Could you please share that Excel file with me at my email address mr.thermographer@rediff.com? This forum has been incredibly beneficial to me. I have gained valuable insights that have proven to be extremely helpful in the early stages of setting up my reliability program. Thank you to everyone who has contributed.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by Steve Turner: Hello Sapper, have you considered any other evaluations? Best regards, Steve. Sapper, we assessed PMO2000, but ultimately chose Meridium for its features and strong partnership with SAP AG. Since integrating Meridium, we have found it to be highly effective in automating our task list generation. Although we encountered a few minor technical issues during the initial setup, Meridium has proven to be a valuable tool for our organization. The accuracy of data input into SAP is crucial for Meridium to generate useful task lists for maintenance and business operations. As with any data collection process, the technician's role is key, so our emphasis has been on educating them on the required data and its importance.</p>

            <p>Hello, it has been a while since I last visited this site, but I wanted to share a tool with you for calculating MTBF. There are multiple methods to determine this figure depending on the desired outcome. How do you plan to enhance reliability? Are you looking to establish benchmarks? Is the main goal to prioritize tasks at the component level? While MTBF is just one aspect of measuring reliability, it can be effectively used in conjunction with other indicators. I have attached the file for your convenience.</p>
