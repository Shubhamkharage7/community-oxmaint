            <p>Hello Panuphan, the level of risk is not solely determined by the equipment in place. Risk is influenced by the frequency of failures and the resulting consequences. The frequency of failures is impacted by demand, design quality, build quality, and equipment maintenance. Consequences are influenced by exposure and local conditions, with the same failure potentially resulting in different outcomes in various locations. Additionally, there are qualitative risks that are influenced by emotions and perceptions, which play a significant role. Ultimately, the determination of risk level rests with you, as only you possess all the necessary information, not a mere equipment provider.</p>

            <p>Once the critical equipment is identified, the next step in risk management involves developing a maintenance strategy to ensure its optimal performance. How can an effective maintenance plan be formulated to mitigate risks and maintain equipment reliability?</p>

            <p>Panuphan, it's important to understand that when it comes to equipment in a process plant, the term 'major' does not necessarily indicate the highest risk involved. To correctly assess risks, start by identifying the significant risks present and then determine which equipment is contributing to those risks. It is not advisable to prioritize 'major' equipment first as this may lead to overlooking crucial elements. For instance, in a process plant, an ESD valve or a deluge valve could potentially pose a higher risk than a compressor. Remember, it's essential to evaluate risks comprehensively to ensure the safety and efficiency of operations.</p>
