                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! I am troubleshooting connectivity issues with my 5069 -L310ers2 PLC, which is equipped with Ethernet ports A1 and A2. During the flashing process, I successfully connected to the A1 port. My objective is to have the plant network on A1 and the controls network on A2. However, despite having all Ethernet devices, such as AENT and VFD, on A2, I am unable to establish an online connection to the PLC when connected to the A2 port via a switch. Interestingly, I can go online when connected to the A1 port, but none of my Ethernet devices are able to connect at that time. Could the issue be related to flashing the PLC from either the A1 or A2 port? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Flashing can be done from ports A1, A2, or USB. For detailed instructions, refer to Chapter 9 of the manual available at the following link: https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/5069-um001_-en-p.pdf.

            <p>To optimize your network settings, switch Port A1 to DHCP when connected via USB and apply the changes. Next, configure Port A2 to use a static IP address specific to your local machine network. This simple adjustment will help ensure seamless connectivity and efficient data transfer.</p>

            <p>aawilliams85 mentioned that flashing can be done from any of the ports (A1, A2, USB). Detailed instructions on this can be found in Chapter 9 of the manual, which can be accessed here: https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/5069-um001_-en-p.pdf. Are you currently in Dual IP mode? If so, do you have a network diagram that you can provide for reference? Unfortunately, I do not have the diagram at the moment. It simply indicates that A1 is connected to the customer network and A2 is connected to the controls. However, there is no need to connect to the customer network presently. Based on the properties shown, it appears that I am in dual mode, as it displays A1/A2 dual mode.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why can I establish an online connection to my 5069 -L310ers2 PLC when connected to Ethernet port A1 but not when connected to port A2?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> The issue could be related to the configuration or setup of the Ethernet ports A1 and A2 on the PLC. It's possible that the network settings or routing for port A2 need to be adjusted to establish connectivity.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Can I have different networks, such as the plant network on port A1 and the controls network on port A2, on the 5069 -L310ers2 PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, it is possible to have different networks assigned to different Ethernet ports on the PLC. However, proper configuration and setup of the ports are required to ensure proper connectivity and communication.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Is there a specific process or best practice for flashing the PLC from either Ethernet port A1 or A2?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> While flashing the PLC from a specific port should not typically cause connectivity issues, it's important to ensure that the flashing process is completed successfully and that the network settings on both ports are correctly configured to avoid any potential issues.</p>
