            <p>Are you referring to Quatech? It's been a while since I've heard that name. Did you catch this news: "On October 13, 2011, B&B Electronics Manufacturing Company, Inc. proudly announced the acquisition of Quatech, a leading global provider of Ethernet, Wi-Fi, USB, and serial device networking solutions for industrial use." Mouser carries some B+B SmartWorx products, but they don't seem to have that specific part number. Consider upgrading to a newer product with updated support and documentation. Share your application details, and the community here can offer recommendations for suitable alternatives.</p>

            <p>I find it astonishing that Quartech appears to have faded into obscurity on the internet. There is a possibility that I possess an old CD containing manuals and software at home, although I am uncertain if I still have a CD drive. However, I can access one at my workplace. If I come across a promising disc, I will bring it in tomorrow to explore its contents.</p>

Due to its size, I am unable to attach everything at once, but dividing it in half should solve the issue. It is important to note that the file "9112_PSP_V104.zip" from my initial attachment should be placed in the "psp" folder within part B of these attachments.</p>

            <p>After years of using my Quartech bookmark, I recently discovered that the company is now known as quartechcorp in either China or Taiwan. However, their website does not seem to provide information about HMI's. I have multiple versions of their software due to the different programming requirements for each panel and driver combination. For example, I used 9800 for PLC5, Mitsubishi FX, and GE Series 90. Additionally, I have Screenmaker9000, which I believe is compatible with all 9xxx panels and drivers. Despite not using any Quartech software for the past 20 years, I remember having to create custom serial cables for each model, using the pinouts provided and standard DB connectors.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The files I shared were extracted from a vintage CD-ROM obtained during a previous employment. Despite my search, I couldn't locate any setup files and my familiarity with the software is limited, hindering my ability to effectively utilize these files. It's plausible that the shared files are merely a duplicated Quartech folder from a computer post-installation, safeguarding against potential data loss in the event of a hard drive malfunction.</p>

            <p>I came across valuable information on Quartech software in my notes. To operate Quartech 9214, an older laptop with a physical RS-232 9pin serial port is essential as USB converters are incompatible. This software is a legacy DOS program and is not compatible with 64-bit operating systems.</p>

            <p>Quartech9214 was designed exclusively for the 9200 panel with a specific communication driver. Each panel model and communication protocol requires its own unique programming software. For example, programming a 9200 panel with an AB PLC5 cannot be done using the software meant for a 9200 panel with GE communication protocols.</p>
