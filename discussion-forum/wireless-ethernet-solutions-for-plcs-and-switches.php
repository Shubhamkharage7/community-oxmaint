                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I regularly connect numerous machines via ethernet cables on a daily basis, however, some machines cannot be connected to the main network due to various reasons. It would be convenient to have the flexibility to move around the machines without being restricted by the length of the patch cable. I am inquiring about the availability of small ethernet wifi dongles that can be inserted into the ethernet port of PLCs or switches in the cabinet. This would allow me to connect to my laptop via wifi, providing me with the freedom to move around the machine more easily. What solutions or recommendations do you suggest for this setup?</p>

            <p>Many individuals have suggested utilizing a compact travel router, a small device that connects to a PLC's Ethernet port and creates a wireless connection, usually powered by a small DC adapter. I have successfully set up a D-Link wifi extender with two antennas to function similarly. By plugging it into a socket on the panel and connecting it to the PLC/switch with an Ethernet cable, I can move around freely while staying connected online without being tied down to the panel.</p>

            <p>Innovative concepts. I was looking for a compact solar panel with a built-in battery as many panels lack sockets. The TP-Link Nano seems like a good option, but I might need a portable battery pack with a micro USB cable to attach it to the router. Despite being a slightly bulky solution, it should be effective.</p>

            <p>Have you considered pairing the TP Link Nano with a 24VDC to USB Converter? By connecting the wires to a convenient 24V power supply terminal block and running a USB cable to the router, you can enhance your setup. Please note that this suggestion is for informational purposes only and not a personal endorsement of the product.</p>

By connecting the wires to a 24V power supply terminal block and running a USB cable to the router, you can create a seamless setup. While I don't personally endorse this product, it does seem like a practical tool.I would prefer a wireless solution rather than dealing with wiring. It would be ideal to have a compact dongle-style router with battery power that you can easily connect to a device for quick setup. This would allow you to swiftly configure the router's IP address on your laptop and get connected in no time.</p>

            <p>I once owned a Schneider Wi-Fi router. While it was convenient for being an all-in-one device, its battery life fell short of lasting a full day. Making adjustments to its settings was tedious, prompting me to reset it to default and reconfigure from there. I later updated it to the firmware used by its TP-Link counterpart. However, after resetting it again, I encountered difficulty accessing it. This led me to switch to a TP-Link nano router, which requires a separate power bank but offers long-lasting battery life, lasting days between charges. I covered the label for privacy reasons.</p>

Despite the slight issue of the micro USB slot being loose, the connection remains stable with great range. To prevent the cable from falling out, I usually wrap it around the slot. I prefer using the AC750 model over the N300 for its dual-band WiFi capabilities at both 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies.</p>

            <p>Lare inquired about the model of the WiFi router: was it an older version or a newer one? Upon inspection, it appears to be a TCSEGWB13FA0, which was initially reconfigured to a TL-MR3040 and then stored away. After retrieving it and setting it up as an access point, some technical issues arose. While using FT Linx for monitoring, RS Linx displayed a red X; however, port configuration was still possible with some troubleshooting. This could be due to computer issues, as it has been running continuously for several days without a restart.</p>

            <p>If you are using TP-Links, have you checked if they support BootP? This can be a hassle when you have to lug around a laptop to connect locally to devices before they are on a network to set IPs. It would be more convenient to use a dongle to connect to field devices and set IPs from a central station. This streamlined process can save you time and effort in managing network configurations.</p>

It would be more convenient to connect a dongle to the field devices and set IPs from a central station. If the stock firmware does not support BootP, consider buying a TP-Link model with OpenWRT support and following the steps outlined in the BOOTP Configuration section for Allen Bradley PLC5 devices. More information can be found on the OpenWRT forum.</p>
