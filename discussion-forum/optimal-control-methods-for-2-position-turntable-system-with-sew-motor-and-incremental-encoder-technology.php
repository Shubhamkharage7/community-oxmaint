                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am seeking advice on the optimal approach for a 2-position turntable control system (refer to the attached image). The turntable rotates 90 degrees before returning to its original position. It is equipped with a conveyor section for transferring products between adjacent conveyors. The SEW motor responsible for driving the slewing ring utilizes a PowerFlex 525 0.4kW VFD and is connected to an EK8S incremental encoder with 1024/4096 analog resolution, wired back to an Allen-Bradley 1734-IK POINT I/O 24V DC Incremental Encoder Module.

What would be considered best practice for controlling the rotation and stopping positions in this scenario? Factors to consider include the use of inductive proximity switches, the utilization of incremental encoder technology, implementing overtravel protection, and incorporating a slowdown mechanism before reaching the desired position.

I apologize if the details provided are vague; I am seeking feedback without divulging the current operational method for comparison. Should you require additional information, please don't hesitate to inquire.</p>

            <p>Apologies for any ambiguity, I am seeking feedback without revealing the current operational method for comparison. Despite knowing the existing design, forum members frequently propose a redesign. Based on the visuals provided, it appears there is some flexibility in the angular positioning, making proximity switches a viable option for accuracy. However, if an encoder and corresponding module are already in place, it would be advantageous to utilize them. Consider the frequency and time constraints for the turntable movements, as well as the inertia of the loaded turntable to determine the acceleration and deceleration rates. The drive must be appropriately sized to handle the necessary current for load acceleration and dissipate kinetic energy during deceleration.</p>

            <p>Set the destination position for the encoder and adjust settings for the speed difference to slow down or creep. Ensure safety with magnetic switches at In Positions A and B. Monitor the encoder closely, and if it overshoots the stop point, gently reverse it to the correct position. This method was successfully implemented on a hoist system with 2 position turntables and racks moving along a 22-station track.

Initially, the hoist had proxy switches for proximity and speed adjustments, but they proved to be inadequate in stopping the hoist on time. Thus, adjustments were made by reprogramming and introducing a count system to fine-tune the destination position. Additionally, a feature was added to allow the hoist to creep back to the correct position in case of overshooting.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey mentioned that despite knowing the current design, forum members still suggested a redesign. Looking at the picture, it appears there is some flexibility in the angular position, indicating that proximity switches could provide sufficient accuracy. However, utilizing an encoder on the motor and corresponding module on the drive could be advantageous. Factors such as the frequency of turntable operation, time available for each move, and the inertia of the loaded turntable will determine the acceleration and deceleration rates. The drive must be adequately sized to handle the current needed for acceleration and dissipate kinetic energy during deceleration.

Considering a combination of encoder positional feedback and proximity switches to establish position bands, like stopping at proxy A for position A and verifying the encoder count falls within a set range. Alternatively, stopping based on encoder count and then confirming with proxy activation could also be a method to consider.

The turntable typically operates 600-900 cycles daily with a takt time of 56 seconds. Speed is not a priority, as cycles are currently completed within 30 seconds. The design is robust and over-engineered for its intended use, mitigating concerns about inertia and other mechanical variables.

I_Automation suggested a methodology for controlling encoder destination positions, adjusting speeds, and utilizing safety magnetic switches for position verification. They shared their experience with similar setups involving turntables and hoists, emphasizing the importance of fine-tuning settings to ensure precise positioning.

Considering the use of proximity switches for stop positions and encoder feedback for speed control, do you anticipate any issues with incremental encoders in cases of power failure, potentially leading to a loss of current position data if the turntable is not in its home position?</p>

            <p>Does your turntable come equipped with a mechanical cam? If it does, you may notice a dead zone where the motor can continue spinning without the turntable moving, allowing for easy motor control with a proximity switch. This type of turntable I have experienced is a more efficient option compared to dealing with servos and the complexities of commissioning and programming them. The decision not to use it if you have it is purely practical - it requires additional work for everyone involved, from programming to troubleshooting when issues arise.</p>

            <p>When working with motion control systems that utilize encoders, it is recommended to incorporate sensors to confirm the home position to detect any mechanical errors early on. By combining positional feedback from the encoder with proximity switches, you can create a system that stops at specific positions and verifies the encoder count within a defined range. This approach ensures accuracy and prevents potential issues.

The turntable in question operates at a rate of 600-900 cycles per day, with a takt time of 56 seconds, allowing for a cycle time of 30 seconds. The design of the system is robust and can handle inertia and other mechanical factors efficiently.

To ensure precise control, one approach is to use proximity switches for stop positions and rely on encoder position for controlling slow movements or overtravel. However, it is important to consider the use of incremental encoders and potential data loss in the event of a power failure, especially if the turntable is not at its home position.</p>

            <p>controlsgirl mentioned the use of a turntable with a mechanical cam, which could have a dead zone where the motor spins but the turntable does not move. This feature allows for easy motor control using a proximity switch without affecting the table's position. Despite the benefits of this type of turntable over a servo system, some may find it challenging to troubleshoot and recover from issues involving encoders and complex controls.

When dealing with motion control using an encoder, it is essential to have a sensor to verify the home position when commanded. This step can help detect mechanical issues early on and prevent faults.

In a scenario where a turntable loses power while halfway through a cycle, causing the encoder count to reset, it is crucial to have a plan for reinitializing the system. One approach could be to drive the turntable until it reaches its home position sensor to reset the count. However, factors like shutdown periods and manual adjustments to the turntable's position can pose challenges that need to be carefully considered to avoid damaging the equipment.</p>

            <p>I would always implement overtravel limits to ensure safety and prevent any damage. This would be done both mechanically, to avoid reliance on fragile components triggering the sensor, and electrically, to cut off power in case of overtravel. When an overtravel occurs, all motion would stop, prompting a manual inspection to address the issue.

The approach taken would depend on the goal of minimizing cost or ensuring durability. Even for cost-saving measures, overtravel limits are crucial as their absence could lead to costly consequences. For a cost-effective approach, positioning would be done with an encoder, allowing operators to set 0 and 90 degree positions for accurate movement.

For a more reliable system, additional position proximity sensors would be added for the 0 and 90 degree positions. The encoder would control movement, but the sensors would trigger halts to verify the encoder readings. In case of power loss or mechanical slip, automatic homing to known positions would be initiated. Any mechanical issues detected by the encoder would prompt either automatic adjustments or manual recalibration, depending on the severity of the issue.</p>

            <p>When it comes to safety in automation, it is crucial to utilize verified safety magnetic switches that stop at the correct encoder count. Avoiding the use of proxy sensors for safety reasons is essential to ensure a secure work environment.

Implementing overtravel limits is a key safety measure, both mechanically and electrically, to prevent any accidents or malfunctions. In case of overtravel, all motion should immediately stop, requiring a manual inspection to address the issue promptly.

Whether the focus is on cost-efficiency or reliability, incorporating safety measures such as position proximity sensors and encoder teaching functions is vital. Automating processes can save on expenses, but prioritizing resilience and reliability may require a more upfront investment for long-term stability.

Choosing between automatic referencing and manual referencing for re-establishing encoder positions is a decision that requires careful consideration. While automation is convenient, having a manual operation in place for rare occurrences can provide an added layer of safety and control.</p>

            <p>Having the option for operators to manually jog and set positions can greatly improve precision compared to relying solely on proximity sensors. Limiting this ability to trusted operators can prevent unnecessary disruptions, like late-night calls for adjustments. Implementing both automated and manual processes ensures flexibility and minimizes the need for constant supervision. Consider implementing an automatic homing process for general use, with a manual homing process reserved for supervisors for enhanced control and efficiency.</p>

            <p>ASF suggested giving operators the capability to manually jog and set positions because human precision is sometimes more accurate than proximity sensors. It is important to entrust this capability to reliable operators to prevent unnecessary disruptions. Implementing both manual and automated processes can help streamline operations and minimize late-night calls for assistance. One potential solution could be to provide an automatic homing process for all operators and a manual homing process exclusively for supervisors. This semi-automatic functionality can be accessed through the HMI with proper permissions, while manual adjustments can be made using an attachable pendant.</p>

It would still be necessary to have overtravel sensors as a backup in case of sensor malfunction, but the non-contact 360-degree angle measurement capability of this sensor seems perfect for this specific scenario.</p>

            <p>When considering what will be on the conveyor, whether it's a 7ft stack of bagged gelatin or a 1ft cube of dense foam, the key is to find a simple and effective solution. For items that can handle some movement, using mechanical hard stops with motion control by a timer is sufficient. A slight slip in the mechanical drive train can allow for intentional impact on the hard stop without causing damage, ensuring durability even with 5000 impacts per day.

In cases where the items are more delicate, such as stacked jelly bags, a more advanced system is needed. Implementing hard stops for over travel events and using ramp profiles based on encoder position allows for gentle acceleration, deceleration, and stopping. Proximity sensors at various points along the travel path can confirm and auto-calibrate the position, ensuring precise and error-free operation.

            <p>I have implemented numerous solutions for a conveyor company, and in my experience, the most effective and reliable one is using proxies (Slow & Stop) in conjunction with a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD). In many cases, hard overtravel stops were incorporated as an additional safety measure in the event of sensor failure. To provide further protection, I used timers with a slight overtravel time to ensure that even if the conveyor hit the hard stop, the motor would be able to stop safely. While I have also worked on systems using encoders for multi-positioning, I find that the proxies and VFD combination is the best choice for optimal performance and reliability.</p>

            <p>Keep it simple and efficient by adding mechanical stops at the end of the travel instead of over travel switches. By over designing the stops for the slow-moving system, you can easily bump into them and apply a low amount of torque to hold the turn table in place. Consider incorporating a "high" speed section in the middle of the movement to speed up the process before transitioning into a slower speed at the end of travel. This way, only two limit switches will be needed. Using an absolute encoder eliminates the need for homing and excessive precision. The approach may vary depending on the specific requirements for speed and precision.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are the optimal control methods for a 2-position turntable system with a SEW motor and incremental encoder technology?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The optimal control methods for such a system typically involve utilizing the PowerFlex 525 0.4kW VFD for motor control, connecting it to the EK8S incremental encoder with 1024/4096 analog resolution, and wiring it back to an Allen-Bradley 1734-IK POINT I/O 24V DC Incremental Encoder Module. Factors to consider include using inductive proximity switches, implementing overtravel protection, and incorporating a slowdown mechanism before reaching the desired position.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can rotation and stopping positions be best controlled in a 2-position turntable system with a SEW motor and incremental encoder technology?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The rotation and stopping positions can be best controlled by programming the VFD and incremental encoder to work together effectively. Utilize the encoder feedback to ensure accurate positioning, set up the VFD for precise speed and direction control, and implement logic for stopping positions based on encoder feedback and overtravel protection mechanisms.</p>
