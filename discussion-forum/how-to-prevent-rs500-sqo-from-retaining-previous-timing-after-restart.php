            <p>In the programming context, drbitboy pointed out that rung 0004 will not engage with U:3 due to the evaluation of XIO B3:0/0 resulting in a value of 0. Consequently, the XIC T4:0/EN will be false since it has been set to 0 on rung 0002. Therefore, it may be beneficial to remove B3:0/0 from rung 4 for clearer logic flow.</p>

            <p>In a forum thread, Joewiza1 suggested eliminating the B3:0\0 component on rung 4 in a programming scenario. This decision hinges on the desired circumstances for triggering SBR U:3. If the goal is for SBR U:3 to replace O:4.0 during every scan cycle when B3:0/0 is 0 and the timer is active but not yet complete, then removing XIO B3:0/0 would achieve this outcome.

Additionally, there is a discrepancy between the Start PB input in the main program file and in program file U:3, which may impact the overall functionality. To clarify the objective, the current code aims to ensure that O:4.0 remains at 0 when the Hold value is 0, sets Hold to 1 when Start PB is pressed and Stop/E-Stop are inactive, and changes O:4.0 to 5 in U:3 when Hold is 1 and Start PB is held down.

It is presumed that XIO B3:0/0 in rung 0004 has been removed to initiate an 8-second repeating timer. Each time this timer elapses, the R6:0 position is incremented, and the corresponding N7:[R6:0.POS] value is assigned to O:4.0.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, Joewiza1 mentioned a challenge they are facing with a programming process where the Rhe "RTO" continues to hold the time from the previous step even after the process is stopped and restarted. They shared a screenshot of their latest attempt and are seeking advice on how to overcome this issue. One possible solution suggested was to replace the RTO instruction with a TON instruction using T4:0, which would reset the accumulator to 0 whenever the "Hold" value is 0. This adjustment would streamline the process and remove the need for Rung 0002, as the timer would automatically reset upon expiration during each scan. Can anyone confirm if this solution will work effectively or provide guidance on the proper approach?</p>

            <p>In determining when SBR U:3 should be activated, it is essential to consider specific conditions. For instance, if the B3:0/0 value is 0 and the timer is still running, overwriting O:4.0 during any scan cycle, then removing XIO B3:0/0 is necessary. Additionally, there seems to be a discrepancy in the Start PB designation between rung 0001 in the main program file and rung 0000 in program file U:3. Can you provide a brief overview of your objectives? As per the current code, certain criteria need to be met: Hold value should always be 0, pressing the Start PB should set Hold to 1 as long as Stop and E-Stop are 0, Hold being 1 should trigger specific actions, including updating O:4.0 and managing a timer. It appears you are aiming to implement a multi-step process involving 5 outputs, each active for 8 seconds before advancing to the next stage. It is crucial that the counter retains its count when stopped, and the position remains unchanged upon restarting. While acknowledging this task is for a class project, it is imperative to include a mov instruction and a jsr in the solution. Assistance may be limited, but it is crucial to seek guidance to avoid mistakes.</p>

            <p>To improve efficiency and eliminate the need for unnecessary programming, consider changing the RTO instruction utilizing T4:0 to a TON instruction. This adjustment will ensure that T4:0 resets its accumulator to 0 whenever the Hold value is reset to 0. As a result, Rung 0002 can be removed as the timer will automatically reset on each scan when it reaches its set time (i.e. when T4:0/DN value switches to 1). This change will streamline the process and optimize functionality in the PLC program.</p>

            <p>For a better understanding of the TON and RTO instructions, I recommend reviewing their descriptions and timing diagrams. Pay close attention to how the .ACC attribute is affected when the rung condition transitions from 1 to 0, especially when the timer does not reach the .PRE value. These differences are illustrated in the timing diagrams found at the bottom of page 79 for RTO and page 98 for TON.

Please note that the links provided are specific to Logix/Studio 5000, but the functionality of the timers is similar in RSLogix 500. The main distinction is that the 5000 timers use a single timebase of 1ms (0.001s), eliminating the need for a Timebase input parameter. However, this does not alter the core logic and operation of the timers.</p>

            <p>Joewiza1 commented that an RTO is necessary for the program. However, the main purpose of using an RTO is to preserve accumulated time when the condition is false, which you mentioned you do not want in your initial post. If there is another reason you are considering using an RTO, as suggested by @robertmee, the solution may be to reset the accumulated time to 0 when the value of Hold is 0.</p>

            <p>When moving from step two to the next while dealing with timers in PLC programming, it is crucial to ensure that the timer retains its value even after a restart. One common issue that may occur is the Timer Accumulation (ACC) continuing from the last scan, causing the timer to show an incorrect value. To avoid this, make sure to scan the Reset Timer On (RTO) properly using the Master Control Relay (MCR). By monitoring the status of the RTO and utilizing the Enable (EN) bit effectively, you can prevent the timer from accumulating time incorrectly. By addressing this issue, you can ensure that the timer stays in its correct position and accurately measures time intervals in your PLC program.</p>

            <p>@Aarwizz has excellently addressed the issue. The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) operates solely based on the commands it receives, without taking into consideration your preferences. It follows instructions rigorously and without exception. To implement a Stop press/Start press sequence that interrupts the current action and moves to the next one, you must provide the PLC with those specific instructions. Could you kindly share the details of the assignment mentioned in post #12? While we can offer guidance, we cannot provide complete code solutions.</p>
