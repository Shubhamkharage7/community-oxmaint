                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Many Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems primarily focus on maintenance accounting rather than effectively managing enterprise level assets. While maintenance accounting includes tracking labor hours, costs, parts, and failures, it often overlooks crucial aspects such as life cycle costs, operating costs, asset health, and performance. This raises the question - are these systems truly providing full Enterprise Level Asset Management, or are they simply serving as failure historians and maintenance cost trackers?

The discrepancy lies in marketing strategies, as EAM systems are often marketed as comprehensive asset management solutions, when in reality they are more suited for maintenance transaction tracking. Despite this, there are plug-in applications available to supplement the deficiencies in EAM systems. However, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of Asset Management before diving into a new EAM system.

In many companies, there is a reluctance to invest in a Maintenance Accounting System (MAS), as the term "maintenance" carries a negative connotation. This stigma leads vendors and companies to promote EAM as a solution for asset management, when its main strength lies in maintenance tracking and recording. Therefore, it is essential to discern between EAM and MAS before deciding on a system that best suits the needs of your enterprise.</p>

            <p>When it comes to Enterprise Asset Management Systems, the focus is often on initial costs and asset performance, but what is frequently overlooked are factors such as life cycle cost, operating cost, energy efficiency, and decommissioning processes. To truly understand data like Life Cycle Cost (LCC), one can utilize systems like SAP PM or PMIS for comprehensive analyses. Additionally, external solutions like Meridium can be considered for asset health monitoring. Various softwares, such as vibration monitoring systems and DCS, offer ways to track equipment performance. Custom analyses can be done in SAP PM with proper IT programming, while Maximo provides packaged analyses or the option to integrate with separate software. Ultimately, the goal is to seamlessly conduct maintenance and reliability analyses within the CMMS without the need for additional software. Whether it's SAP, Maximo, or any other software, the choice is yours for improving maintenance programs. Aim for an integrated Maintenance & reliability software, and count me in!</p>

            <p>Quote by Terrence O'Hanlon: Many Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) systems focus more on maintenance accounting than on effectively managing assets. Maintenance accounting typically includes tracking labor hours, labor cost, parts usage, part cost, time between failures, time to repair, and failure codes. However, crucial aspects such as life cycle cost, operating cost, asset health, and asset performance are often overlooked in these systems.

Despite being marketed as comprehensive Enterprise Asset Management solutions, what users often end up with is essentially a maintenance cost tracker and failure historian. The focus on maintenance over asset management may be attributed to the negative connotations associated with the term 'maintenance accounting.'

An effective EAM system should go beyond mere maintenance tracking and recording. It should provide insights into asset performance, health, and total cost of ownership. While there are plug-in applications available to supplement EAM systems, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of asset management principles before implementing a new system.

EAM allows for revenue offsetting relative to the costs incurred by assets. For example, a SAP-centric EAM solution can assist in aligning overhaul costs with revenues earned during that time period. Properly incorporating energy costs into the total cost of ownership can also optimize asset management processes.

Collaboration between asset owners, IT teams, and experienced consultants is essential for successful EAM implementation. A well-designed EAM solution should not only streamline operations but also promote proactive asset management, leading to cost savings and improved asset reliability over time. If you believe EAM is limited to accounting and historical data, it may be time to consult with an expert to unlock its full potential.</p>
