            <p>Wrench time, in our CMMS system, refers to the hands-on time spent by mechanics on a specific job assignment. This time is tracked by having mechanics report the hours they dedicate to a task, excluding time spent on housekeeping, lunch, training, and meetings. The hours logged can be connected back to a specific work order for accountability and tracking purposes.</p>

            <p>In maintenance management, the concept of wrench time is crucial for measuring the actual time craftsmen spend working on tasks. It excludes travel time, spare parts and tool pickup, waiting times, and discussions related to the job. This is different from the time charged on work orders in some companies. By measuring wrench time, organizations can identify inefficiencies and prioritize areas for improvement. Conducting a job study is essential to accurately measure wrench time, and there are various methods that can be used. Personally, I find that work sampling is the most cost-effective method for achieving precise results.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The concept of measuring 'wrench time' is a valuable tool for identifying inefficiencies in labor processes within the manufacturing industry. However, it is not widely utilized for a variety of reasons. One common reason is that maintenance management may be reluctant to reveal inefficiencies that could reflect poorly on their leadership. Additionally, the process of collecting data for 'wrench time' measurements can be met with resistance from employees if not properly explained, leading to skewed results.

Having conducted numerous 'statistical activity surveys' in various settings, I have consistently found areas for improvement in planning, scheduling, materials management, work site preparation, and communications. By enhancing 'hands on' activity time from 23.6% to 30.3% through strategic improvements, we were able to significantly increase 'wrench time' and consequently boost overall efficiency.

It is crucial to view 'wrench time' as a key performance indicator for ongoing enhancement of workforce productivity. However, it is essential to ensure consistency in the measurement process and communicate that it is meant for improvement rather than blame. Each 'wrench time' survey may use different methodologies, making direct comparisons challenging without a thorough analysis. By embracing 'wrench time' as a tool for identifying and addressing inefficiencies, manufacturing companies can drive continuous improvement in their operations.</p>

            <p>I wholeheartedly agree with Joyo's insights, as they align with my own experiences. While there was a belief that poor wrench time was due to worker attitudes, it is widely accepted now that Planning, Scheduling, and Work Preparation are the main culprits behind lost time. Waiting for necessary items such as Work Permits, Tools, Materials, Spares, Instructions, or Supervision guidance is often the cause of delays. Simply increasing activity sampling is unlikely to yield different results. The root causes are clear, so it's time to address and resolve them. V. Narayan.</p>
