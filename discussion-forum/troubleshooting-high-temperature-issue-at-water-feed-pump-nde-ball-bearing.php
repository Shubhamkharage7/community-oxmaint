                    <p>Hello friends, we are currently dealing with a high-temperature issue in the Water feed pump NDE ball bearing (7309 - 2 bearings in a Back-to-back arrangement). The pump is rated at 200 KW with a pressure of 11 Bar and utilizes sump lubrication. The pump is manufactured by Thermomechnica Pump. Despite overall pump vibrations being within acceptable limits (4 mm/s rms at POV), we have identified dominant frequencies at 1X, 2X, and 6X (VPF). After just 2 hours of operation, the Pump NDE bearing temperature rose to 60 degrees, while the Pump DE bearing temperature remained at 45 degrees. In comparison, other identical pumps have maximum Pump DE & NDE temperatures of 44 & 45 degrees.</p>

            <p>Hello MahizhVin, have you inspected the alignment and lubrication of your equipment? There may be a rubbing issue present. Kindly provide the spectrum for a more comprehensive analysis.</p>

            <p>If you're referring to a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), I wouldn't be too worried. However, without knowing the maintenance history, I would inquire about any recent work that may provide an explanation. High temperatures can be caused by various factors such as inadequate lubrication, too much lubrication (often seen in greased bearings), incorrect preload (especially with duplex paired bearings requiring a specific preload design). Was the preload properly implemented? Additionally, excessive misalignment can lead to elevated temperatures. Best regards, Jim P.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Kishore, for your assistance. The shaft alignment is within the acceptable tolerance levels. Should I be concerned about potential bearing misalignment that may need to be checked? This specific 7309 ball bearing, configured as 2* Back to Back, utilizes sump lubrication. Where would friction likely occur? Is it between the oil seal and the shaft? The temperature of the Pump DE bearing is normal, but the NDE bearing is unexpectedly 15 degrees higher, which is highly unusual for pumps of this type. It is worth noting that the pump shaft, bearings, and wear rings have all been recently replaced.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Mr. Jim, for your input regarding the shaft alignment. Is it possible that there is bearing misalignment that I should investigate? The type of ball bearing in question is a 7309 sump lubrication bearing with a Back to Back arrangement. It is noteworthy that the Pump DE bearing temperature is normal, while the NDE bearing is 15 degrees higher than usual, which is quite unusual compared to similar pumps. It is worth mentioning that the pump shaft, wearings, and bearings have all been recently replaced.</p>

If so, this would be a key area to examine. Take a closer look at the maintenance work done to pinpoint any potential causes for the temperature increase.</p>

            <p>When it comes to flow-induced vibration, it's crucial to continuously monitor temperature trends to ensure they are not increasing or decreasing drastically. Regular inspections should be conducted to check for any assembly errors and take advantage of any lubrication opportunities that may arise. Currently, vibration readings are within normal parameters, so there is no need to be overly concerned. Keep a close eye on these factors to maintain optimal equipment performance and prevent potential issues in the future.</p>

            <p>In response to @Jim Powers' question about higher temperatures after recent maintenance on the pump shaft, wear rings, and bearings, it's important to closely examine the maintenance performed to identify any potential causes for the temperature increase. Checking the shaft temperature near the bearing oil seal is a good next step after recently replacing the bearings and seals.</p>

            <p>@kishore kumar agguna shared: It appears that the vibration is caused by flow-induced factors. It is important to regularly monitor temperature trends to see if they are increasing, stabilizing, or decreasing. Check for any assembly errors and look for opportunities to improve lubrication. Currently, vibration readings are normal, so there is no need to worry too much. Thank you, Kishore. The temperature is gradually increasing, and we have installed protection tripping logic for the pump bearing temperature. We are closely monitoring the situation. Do you think imperfections in the bearing housing could be causing the temperature to rise?</p>
