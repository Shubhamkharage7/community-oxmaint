            <p>In electrical systems, a circuit breaker plays a crucial role in safeguarding circuits from overload, while an overload protector prevents motor leads from overheating. It is common practice for a circuit breaker to be positioned before a contactor, with an overload protector either attached to or situated immediately behind the contactor or motor starter within the circuit. These protective measures are in accordance with NEC Article 430.</p>

            <p>Circuit breakers are essential for immediate short-circuit defense, serving as a crucial component for protecting motors. Motor overloads can be adjusted within a specified range to align with the motor's full-load amperage (FLA) and will activate if the motor surpasses the maximum current draw over a prolonged period.</p>

            <p>As mentioned previously, in a motor control setup, the Motor Circuit Breaker (MCB) is typically located before the contactor, while the overload is located after the contactor. Overloads usually come with pins for easy attachment to the contactor. Some motor circuit breakers can be paired with a link module or kit to connect them to the contactor, creating a combination starter. It is advisable to use a coil module if the coil is located on top of the contactor, and a line-space adapter may be required for the MCB to meet the combination starter rating.

It is important to note that the AUX contacts of the overload and circuit breaker are reversed. In the event of a MCB tripping, the N.O. contact is used to turn off the contactor coil, as the tripped state is 'off'. Conversely, when an overload trips, the N.C. contact is used to deactivate the contactor coil.

It should be noted that overloads do not offer significant SCCR protection, so it is recommended to use a fuse in front of the contactor/overload. On the other hand, many MCB/combination starters are rated between 35k-65k SCCR and may not require fusing if the rating is adequate.</p>

            <p>In addition, Motor Overloads/Motor Breakers are designed to trip in case of 'single phasing', which occurs when one phase is lost in the power supply or motor connection. Three phase motors are capable of running on just two phases, potentially starting depending on the load, although the direction of rotation may be uncertain. This phenomenon is crucial to prevent motor damage and ensure operational safety.</p>

            <p>When should you add motor overload protection and why is it important? Some applications only have breakers or fusing on certain motors, but when should you consider using motor overloads as well? Can overloads be used in place of a circuit breaker? It's crucial to always have overload protection in place.

Motor circuit breakers can serve as a substitute for overloads, offering the advantage of not requiring fusing and automatically opening when tripped. Unlike overloads, circuit breakers provide auxiliary contacts that do not open when tripped. If you're interested in a comprehensive guide on Bussman products, particularly their fusing options, search online for "Bussman SPD" for detailed tables and information on different motor circuit requirements.</p>

            <p>Excessive loading can cause a motor to overheat, potentially leading to burnout or even a fire hazard. A slight overload will gradually increase the temperature, while a significant overload will result in a rapid temperature rise. To prevent damage, it is crucial to disconnect the power source before the motor reaches dangerous temperatures and address the root cause of the overload before restarting the machine.

Ideally, motor temperature should be directly measured using thermistors in the motor windings, although this method can be expensive and is not commonly utilized for small motors. An alternative approach involves using a Motor Thermal Overload or Motor Breaker, which mimics the temperature increase within the motor by heating bimetallic strips in the overload mechanism.

Unlike a miniature circuit breaker, a Thermal Overload lacks protection against sudden large overcurrents but is sensitive to long-lasting overcurrents and phase discrepancies. On the other hand, a miniature circuit breaker offers protection against sudden large overcurrents but lacks the thermal component found in a motor breaker.

Motor breakers combine the features of an MCB and a Thermal Overload but are typically pricier compared to individual MCBs or Thermal Overloads. Adding an auxiliary pack allows a motor breaker to switch off the mains via a contactor for added safety. Some users may prefer a combination of thermal overload and fuses for protection against long slow overloads, single-phasing, and sudden large overloads.

Ultimately, the decision to use motor protection devices depends on the motor type and the designer's considerations regarding motor overheating. In some cases, it may be deemed acceptable to forgo protection for small motors in less critical applications where burnout consequences are minimal. However, for larger motors, it is essential to implement appropriate overload protection measures to prevent damage and ensure safe operation.</p>

            <p>BryanG explained that while a miniature circuit breaker can handle sudden large over currents, it is not equipped to detect small, long-lasting over currents or missing phases like motor breakers can. Many modern motor circuit breakers are designed with differential tripping capabilities to detect a missing phase and trip at the appropriate winding temperature. This is achieved through a sophisticated mechanical linkage in the breaker's trigger mechanism. For instance, Siemens 3RV motor circuit breakers offer this feature. When using a regular MCCB in a motor starter, it lacks the ability to trip early on a missing phase. However, when combined with an overload, the overload device can provide the missing phase detection function needed for proper operation.</p>

            <p>When using a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) to power multiple motors, I recommend using Overload Relays instead of Motor Circuit Protectors (MCP's). This is especially important for applications such as fans and conveyors. One key concern when using a VFD is the risk of a circuit opening while in operation, which can result in a damaging voltage spike. To prevent this issue, install a group of Overload Relays with Normally Closed (N/C) contacts wired in series to trip the VFD in case of an 'External Fault'. This setup ensures the protection of both the motors and the VFD system.</p>

            <p>To clarify, I am discussing circuit breakers designed for loads or motors, like the Allen Bradley 140M series, not supplemental or mini-circuit breakers such as the Allen Bradley 1492. These two types serve different purposes and are used for different applications. The 1492 series can replace a fuse but still requires an overload for proper motor protection. If you attempt to size these incorrectly for motor protection, you may experience nuisance tripping. It is often necessary to oversize them to accommodate the motor's startup current. On the other hand, the 140M series replaces both the overload and fuses, specifically tailored for motor applications.</p>

            <p>Hey Tom, do we really need to include that normally closed OL contact (highlighted in yellow) in series to ensure motor protection? Aren't the 3 circled blue OL symbols enough to protect the motor? In my experience at the plant, the normally closed OL contact is typically used to signal the PLC when an overload occurs. Technicians then reset the overloads or troubleshoot if the issue persists. This design is new to me but it seems efficient as the OL contact is hardwired in series right after the coil. I'm curious if adding the OL contact after the M relay is necessary for additional protection. Thank you.</p>

            <p>alive15 asked Tom Jenkins if adding the normally closed OL contact in series, highlighted in yellow, is necessary to protect or stop the motor. He questioned whether the three OL symbols circled in blue are enough for motor protection. In his experience, the normally closed OL contact is often used as a signal back to the PLC to alert technicians when the overload is tripped. The lack of a signal from the OL contact to the PLC would turn off the signal to the "M" relay. This unique design of hardwiring the OL contact after the M relay raised a question about whether it is necessary or provides extra protection. The OL includes an integral N.C. contact that breaks the starter's neutral, while the overload symbols are heater elements that do not interrupt the motor voltage. The N.O. contact mentioned is an additional auxiliary on the OL that can be used for status indication.</p>

            <p>Including a normally open (NO) contact in the circuit will prevent the contactor from closing, ultimately stopping the motor from running. When programming a PLC, it is crucial to incorporate feedback to monitor if the overload protection has been activated. By integrating this feedback into your logic, you can ensure that the coil is turned off when necessary. Failing to interrupt the contactor signal can have dangerous consequences, as the motor may unexpectedly start running again once the overload is reset. It is best practice to clear the fault and then deliberately initiate the motor restart only after confirming that the fault has been resolved. Some companies opt to include a normally closed (NC) contact in the PLC outputs, while others do not. Regardless of the approach taken, it is vital to handle the situation cautiously and appropriately.</p>
