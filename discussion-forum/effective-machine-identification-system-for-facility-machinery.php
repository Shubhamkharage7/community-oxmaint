                    <p>I am currently working on establishing an identification system for the machines in my facility. I have made a few key decisions: I will not be using the accountant's asset numbers, but I will reference them. The system will be alpha-numeric, for example, "ACM 0001" which translates to "AC Motor #0001". The identification numbers will not be tied to the machines' locations to allow for flexibility in moving them around. In addition, I am open to suggestions from others. I plan to source brass tags with small holes for permanent marking using letter/number punches, which will then be securely attached to the machines with shallow drilled holes and rivets.</p>

            <p>When it comes to equipment numbering systems, various discussions are found on CMMS forums, including the ones focused on SAP R/3. I will share some references later on. It is crucial to maintain consistency when choosing equipment codes. Avoid using similar codes like "PMP" for Pump if "P" already stands for Pump. Consider the length of your sequence code - four digits may suffice depending on the size of your plant. Ensure that each equipment number is unique to prevent confusion. For example, if "ACM-0001" is assigned to a motor, make sure it is not used again for a new equipment in the future.</p>

            <p>Our current numbering system can accommodate up to 10,000 motors. Have you considered using the first or second number to indicate the voltage of the motor? For example, the ACM4101 designation allows for 100 motors at 4160 volts, while ACM0401 signifies the first motor at 480 volts. This numbering convention can help streamline organization and identification of motors based on their voltage requirements.</p>

            <p>Quote from a CBM Novice addressing the numbering system: The system has the capacity for up to 10,000 motors. Consider using the first (and possibly the second) number to represent the voltage of the motor. For example, ACM4101 can accommodate 100 motors running at 4160 volts, while ACM0401 would denote the first motor at 480 volts. However, if the labeled equipment is not a motor, how would the digits be interpreted? Will the meaning of the digits change based on the equipment code used?</p>

For example, ACM4101 could denote 100 motors at 4160 volts, while ACM0401 could stand for the first motor at 480 volts. While this idea is intriguing, its practicality may be questioned. Is it more beneficial for the numbers to be organized by chronological order rather than voltage levels? Ultimately, I believe simplicity is key, so I will opt to stick with just the numerical system.</p>

            <p>quote: In the realm of equipment coding, consistency is key. Avoid using variations of the same code for different equipment. For example, if P stands for Pump, stick to using P and refrain from using PMP, PWP, or CRP for different types of pumps. To keep things organized, I have created three-letter codes for various equipment at my plant. These include ACM for AC Motors, COR for Corrugators, DCM for DC Motors, and many more such as EXT, FBL, GRM, MXR, OTH, RSL, SPD, VAC, and WAT.</p>

            <p>It is important to have a systematic tagging procedure in place to keep track of all equipment during design and construction phases. If you do not already have a tagging system in place, it is recommended to create a list mapping equipment to alphabet letters from A to Z. This helps in easily identifying and labeling major equipment. For instance, using the second letter to denote the driver type (e.g. M for motors, D for diesel engines, T for turbines) can streamline the identification process. Consider adopting a standardized equipment tagging format such as AB-XXYY, where A represents equipment functions, B indicates driver functions, XX denotes system numbers, and YY signifies equipment numbers. For instrument tagging, refer to the established Instrument Institute tagging system to avoid duplicating efforts. It may be worth exploring industry standards, such as those provided by AIChemE, for guidance on equipment tagging.</p>

            <p>Quote: Josh expressed concern about the lack of a tagging procedure for equipment in place. He suggested creating a system that assigns alphanumeric codes to major equipment based on their function and driver. This system would consist of a two-letter code representing equipment and driver functions, followed by two digits for system numbers and equipment numbers. However, Josh raised a valid point about the challenges of using location-based identifiers, especially when equipment needs to be replaced or relocated. To simplify the process and avoid confusion, he proposed using a three-letter functional identifier combined with a numerical code that increments with each new machine purchase. This approach ensures easy identification and maintenance of equipment records.</p>

            <p>In order to ensure accurate and meaningful insights from your data, it is crucial to clearly define the information you want your numbers to convey. This typically includes location details such as building, area, or room numbers, as well as equipment types like motors and extruders. To enhance organization and searchability, consider categorizing sub-types within each equipment type, such as gear motors, DC motors, and AC motors. By prioritizing key keywords in your descriptions, you can improve sorting efficiency. For example, listing pumps with specific functions first, such as diesel tank pumps or potable water distribution pumps, can streamline the process. Additionally, be cautious when using vague categories like "Other," as they can lead to confusion and inconsistencies as your inventory grows. It is advisable to establish clear naming conventions to maintain consistency and accuracy in your data management system.</p>

            <p>When your equipment with the code "MA-01-122" breaks and you purchase a new one, should you label it as "MA-01-122"? The answer is no - it is important to assign a unique equipment number. In this case, "MA" signifies the equipment type, "01" represents the location code, and "122" is a sequence number to distinguish the unit as a unique item. Therefore, if you exchange the old MA-01-122 with a new unit of the same type at location 01, the new unit should be marked as MA-01-395. This new number, 395, should be the next available sequence number to avoid duplication with any previously used equipment numbers. It is crucial to ensure that equipment numbers are not repeated once a unit has been replaced.</p>

            <p>Mike explains the importance of maintaining a consistent tagging system in CMMS to differentiate between equipment numbers and tag numbers. The tag number, such as "MA-01-122," will remain permanent unless it is no longer needed, while the equipment number can change when a new unit is installed. This means that while your tag "MA-01-122" will always stay the same, your equipment number could potentially shift from 12345 to 67890. It is common for equipment numbers to follow a sequential series. Remember to always keep track of both numbers for accurate tracking and maintenance purposes.</p>

            <p>Eugene mentioned that when sorting your list, it's important to keep motors and pumps separate. One suggestion is to start descriptions with the keyword for better organization, like "Pump - Diesel Tank" and "Pump - Potable Water Distribution." This tip is worth considering to maintain clarity in the list. 
Additionally, it's wise to avoid using generic codes like "Other," as they can lead to confusion as the list grows. It's important to carefully plan and avoid the need for code changes in the future.</p>

            <p>Quote from Eugene: "If your 'MA-01-122' breaks and you purchase a replacement, does it then become 'MA-01-122'? No, that should never happen. The code 'MA' represents the equipment type, '01' signifies the location, and '122' is a unique identifier for that specific equipment unit. It seems like there may be confusion between location codes and machine identifiers in the conversation between you and Josh. If the location code simply represents the current location, I can work with that. I will take some time to consider it further."</p>

            <p>An effective tagging system includes identifying components such as pumps (P), tanks (Tk), pressure gauges (PG), and motors (M). For example, a pump may be tagged as P-01-122, a diesel tank as Tk-01-122, a pressure gauge as PG-01-122, and a motor as PM-01-122. Separate formats are used for piping tags to specify pressure ratings, materials, insulation types, and other relevant information.</p>

            <p>The reason I do not use the Tag & =Equipment number is because I have set up my CMMS to accept alphanumeric equipment numbers in a specific format, such as 100AHU1200. In this format, 100 represents the location code (Building 100), AHU represents the equipment type (Air Handling Unit), and 1200 is a unique sequence identifier for the combination of 100 & AHU. This allows me to have multiple units labeled as 1200 in my system, but the full number (e.g. 100AHU1200) is always unique and not duplicated. For example, I may have 100AHU1200 as the first unit, 100AHU1000 as another AHU in the same building requiring a different sequence number, and 200AHU1200 as another AHU with the same sequence located in a different building. This customization helps me track and manage equipment effectively.</p>

            <p>In order to prevent confusion in CMMS, it is common practice to assign a tag number to each piece of equipment, along with a corresponding equipment number. This helps to streamline the process of replacing equipment by simply swapping out the tag when a spare unit is needed from the warehouse or store. By matching the equipment number with the tag number, you can easily update the equipment without having to make changes to the drawings and documents. This method ensures efficiency and accuracy in equipment maintenance and management.</p>

            <p>Josh initially asked if changing the tagging in the drawings and documents would be necessary if the tag number matches the equipment number. This is an issue he is trying to avoid. Currently, motors and other equipment are identified by their location and the major machinery they are in. For example, you might refer to 'the motor in the perforator on the co-ax tubing line'. Josh is seeking a more accurate way to identify equipment without limiting himself in the process. By following the standard CMMS practice of using two numbers - one for location and one for the actual equipment - he believes this could be the solution. The question remains whether the item description, such as 'pump, AC motor', should be included in the tag number or the equipment number.</p>

For instance, CW could stand for Circulating Water, FW for feedwater, and FWP001 for Feed Water. The issue with assigning a single number to both the item and its location is that items may be moved frequently. In the event of a malfunction, items like perforators, filter loaders, haul-offs, and other movable machines may be swapped between lines using a forklift. In cases where a motor needs replacing and no spares are available, motors from less critical lines may be temporarily reassigned. To avoid the hassle of changing machine IDs when relocating them, it is preferable not to closely link components to their location. A location code could be assigned to each machine and documented in paperwork for easy reference, allowing users to identify the machine's location or find out which component is in a specific area. This system promotes flexibility and ease of tracking without the need for frequent ID changes due to relocations.</p>

            <p>Throughout my extensive experience in various refineries over the past three decades, I have come to understand that a TAG number represents a specific position in the processing chain rather than a singular piece of equipment, making it a stationary identifier. The contents of this position can vary, such as a motor failing and being substituted by a spare that then assumes the TAG position. In managing my MASTER records, I consistently referenced the TAG position while maintaining secondary files for each individual equipment item. These secondary files were mobile, corresponding with the movement of equipment - for instance, if a pump required maintenance in the workshop, its file would be relocated accordingly to document every action taken. Once the pump was repaired and reinstalled, the secondary file would return to the TAG position file to maintain a comprehensive record of equipment activity within the refinery. This method allowed me to efficiently track the location of equipment throughout the facility and ensure that equipment files remained current. While the actual numbering or identification system for each piece of equipment is subjective, I recommend simplicity, such as using "M" for motor, "P" for pump, and "T" for turbine.</p>

            <p>A TAG represents a specific role within a process train and is tied to a particular piece of equipment. While the TAG itself cannot be altered, the equipment associated with it can be changed. I maintained MASTER files that kept a permanent record of each TAG's history. Additionally, I kept EQUIPMENT files that tracked the movements and maintenance of each piece of equipment over time. Typically, the EQUIPMENT file was stored within the MASTER file alongside the TAG it was assigned to, but it would occasionally be temporarily relocated, such as to a workshop for repairs. This system ensured that the EQUIPMENT file was continually updated and accurate.</p>

            <p>Our TAG/EQUIPMENT format is consistent with our practices. Each SITE is distinguishable by a unique code consisting of 8 digits (xxxx-xxxx), with the first 4 digits denoting the department and the second 4 digits indicating the specific location. Every piece of EQUIPMENT is assigned a distinct ID. Sequential numbers are used for identifying AC motors, while a 3 letter code is utilized for DC motors. Other equipment such as pumps, reducers, and turbines are labeled with the appropriate prefix.</p>

            <p>After years of experience in the accounting department and handling inventory, Mike the Maintenance Guy suggests a new naming format for equipment in the maintenance organization. The proposed format includes using a combination of alphabetical and numerical characters, where the alphabet signifies the type of equipment. For example, BE1234 would represent Building Equipment, FE1234 for Factory Equipment, and FM1234 for Factory Machine used in production processes. Other equipment categories like air handling (AH) or Office Equipment (OE) can be designated with similar codes. This naming system helps in quickly identifying the type of equipment, aiding in maintenance planning and location tracking. To keep it concise, it's recommended to limit the use of alphabetical characters. Additionally, adding a building indicator before the code, such as ABE1234 for Building A- Building Equipment, can further enhance organization. Best of luck implementing this system!</p>

            <p>Hello, I agree with DeeJ's advice to avoid overly complicated descriptions. We have a wide variety of plant equipment, but we focus on identifying major machinery items instead of every single motor. For example, we use codes like NP341 to represent specific assets, such as a pump for recovered slurry. It's important to start itemizing your plant equipment, using simple five alphanumeric codes to avoid confusion. When we replace a motor, it automatically gets a new plant number. Our electricians keep a separate record of all motors cataloged by asset numbers. While we have asset tags for most items, work orders typically reference plant numbers. I use a Brady label machine to create plant numbers and attach them to equipment for easy identification. I hope this information is helpful. - Mike.</p>

            <p>I posted a detailed response to this question approximately a week ago. If you can't find it, here's a brief overview. In the refineries where I worked, we used a system where P represents a pump, T represents a turbine, and M represents a motor, among other abbreviations. I maintained two sets of files: a "Master" file system categorized by TAG numbers, and an "Equipment" file for every piece of equipment in the refinery (such as pumps, motors, compressors, and turbines). Typically, Equipment files were stored in their respective TAG position files. However, if a pump needed maintenance or was removed for repair, the Equipment file would go along with it to the workshop, where all actions taken were documented. This method ensured that my equipment files were always kept current and accurate.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is important to have 2 sets of identification numbers for efficient asset management: 

1. Tag numbers, which are specific to each location and should already be defined during the engineering design phase. Consult with your engineering or plant manager for these files. 

2. Equipment numbers, which directly identify physical assets. These numbers may need to be created by you, unless you are utilizing a CMMS system that automatically generates them. When using a CMMS, intelligent coding is not necessary as all equipment details will be readily available when needed. 

For my oil and gas exploration and production company, I use the equipment's serial number as the equipment number and have found this to be successful for identification purposes. 

To organize equipment hierarchies effectively, consider setting up multiple hierarchies within your CMMS package, grouping similar items together such as electrical, instrumentation, mechanical, vessels, and pipes. This may require setting up multiple 'parents' for each equipment, which can be time-intensive but ultimately beneficial for future maintenance and asset management. 

While setting up this system may be challenging and time-consuming, the long-term benefits make it worthwhile. It's important to invest the time and effort now for a smoother operation in the future.</p>

            <p>When setting up a maintenance system for equipment, it is essential to start with a detailed Master Equipment Schedule (MES) that includes all driven and non-driven equipment, using Asset Tag Numbers for identification. This list should also specify the HP and RPM motor ratings for driven equipment. Next, create an Electrical Services Schedule (ESS) based on the MES, sorting services by HP/RPM and Asset Tag Numbers. The ESS can further be sorted by equipment type, such as Water Pumps or Vacuum Pumps. Following this, compile a Motor Schedule (MS) detailing motor specifications like type, rating, voltage, and enclosure. Consider physically tagging each motor for easy tracking, using SS plate tags engraved with a unique Motor No. These tags remain on the motor permanently, allowing for easy location and replacement. The MES, ESS, and MS can be created using simple Excel spreadsheets, tailored to your specific needs and even made interactive for automatic updates. By structuring motor numbers in blocks according to motor type, you can quickly identify the specifications of each motor. For instance, M 001 - M 399 may represent AC Motors 600 V TEFC Foot Mtd. Make use of this organized system to efficiently manage and maintain your equipment inventory.</p>

            <p>Eugene, there are no other tags required besides the ones I mentioned. The main purpose of the system I have detailed is to effectively monitor MOTORS within the plant. As motors are often relocated due to failures and replaced with spare motors, it is crucial to keep a record of their movements. The equipment being driven does not need to be physically tagged, as the machinery assets can be tracked in the MES system. Each motor should have a designated local control station or control panel, known as the SERVICE NUMBER or Location Number. This number is used to identify the specific driven machine using an engraved lamacoid nameplate. The Service Number may match the Asset Tag or be different, following a format such as XXX - 1018 - No.18 Dryer Circulation Fan (Department # - Sequential # - Descriptor).</p>
