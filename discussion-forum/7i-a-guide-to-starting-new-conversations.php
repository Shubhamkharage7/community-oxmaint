            <p>Greetings, Everyone! The selection of 7i without consulting Datastream for its functionality seems to be a political decision made by someone. The Request for Proposal is now open to potential implementation vendors for 7i. Personally, I was brought in to introduce a new CMMS and have experience with FAMIS & TMA, but I am unfamiliar with 7i. The agency prefers to delegate the implementation responsibility to a third party. While each CMMS is unique, they share similarities. I cannot communicate with Datastream until the implementation vendor is chosen. I have some queries and would appreciate real-life insights. Can 7i support multiple account codes for work orders, parts procurement, and purchase orders with varying percentages? Can it assign multiple crafts to the same work order? Does 7i require individual licenses instead of concurrent ones? How complex is the PM scheduling in 7i? Does the 'Scheduler' function effectively for daily assignments? Can identifiers be added to the work order numbering sequence in 7i, such as PM12345 for preventive maintenance? Lastly, how does Datastream compare to other systems in terms of usability? Appreciate your insights and responses. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Since 1994, our system has been utilizing Datastream. One common question we receive is whether the 7i system can manage multiple account codes for work orders, allowing for charges to be split across different accounts. This may seem like a unique request, but the answer is yes. Although our system is pricy as it operates on Oracle, the overall flexibility it offers makes it a suitable choice for businesses looking for a comprehensive CMMS solution. It may not be the most ideal option for small businesses, but its capabilities are extensive.</p>

            <p>Hi Steven, thank you for your prompt response. I have several questions regarding the Datastream 7i software from a practical perspective. To keep it concise, here are a few questions: 

1. Has Datastream met your expectations since 1994? 
2. Did you find the program ready to use right out of the box, or did it require significant customization before implementation?
3. Who was responsible for implementing the software: yourself, Datastream, or a third-party provider?
4. Are you hosting your data in-house or utilizing a "Hosted" site for data storage and maintenance?

I have a long list of questions to ask, but we are unable to communicate with Datastream until an implementation vendor is chosen. These questions mainly revolve around functionality and potential issues. Thank you for your responses and for addressing my queries. - Mike</p>

            <p>1) While Datastream software has lived up to my expectations, the team behind it has been less impressive. 
2) After purchasing the original product (Rapier) in 2000, Datastream rebranded it as MP5 and later as DataStream, making some customizations along the way. 
3) When implementing the software with the vendor at the time, SQL-Systems, it became clear that D7i required a Database Administrator, unlike common programs like M$ Word or AutoCAD. Luckily, there are now many independent consultants available for assistance. Our company underwent a thorough reorganization to adapt our processes. 
4) We have always hosted in-house and did not have internet access at the time of implementation.</p>

            <p>Steven, I appreciate your valuable insights. When I first joined this organization, there were no established business processes. However, after six months, I have successfully implemented structured processes, although the transition has been challenging due to the need for increased accountability. I have created equipment hierarchies, prepared a comprehensive Excel workbook for data migration, and outlined a phased implementation plan. Now, I am eagerly awaiting the vendor selection process so that I can finally engage with Datastream.

It has taken the organization three years to reach this point, leading to my recruitment following the retirement of the individual previously handling this role. While we have two DBAs on staff, they are already overloaded managing four other major programs, including GIS and Construction Management, prompting my query about hosting solutions. 

Out of the consultants who received the Request for Proposal (RFP), only seven have expressed interest, with perhaps three being strong contenders. However, there is concern within the committee about Datastream's decision to collaborate with another vendor for the implementation. 

Once again, thank you for taking the time to provide insights on my queries. Thank you, Mike.</p>

            <p>To the best of my knowledge (AFAIK), Datastream initially released the MP2 product, not the MP5. I personally used MP2 around nine or ten years ago and found it to be subpar. I cannot speak to its current state, but during my usage, it was notably lacking in quality.</p>

            <p>Bryan, you are correct in stating that DataStream's main software product was MP2. However, in order to enter the realm of Client-server technology, they acquired Rapier and rebranded it as MP5. Eventually, this evolved into DataStream 7i.</p>

Thank you for providing your insights. To address your questions:
1. Yes, 7i allows for easy modification to handle multiple account codes and percentages adjustment.
2. 7i can assign various specialties and certifications to work orders.
3. You can purchase individual or concurrent licenses for 7i.
4. PM scheduling on 7i can be streamlined if you know how to use the tools effectively.
5. The 'Scheduler' in 7i works efficiently but relies on the commitment of resources.
6. There are ways to filter maintenance types in work orders in 7i, but I haven't tried customizing the work order numbering sequence.
7. Datastream is considered an excellent maintenance system, offering KPIs and advanced maintenance capabilities for continual improvement. Personally, I believe it is the best in the market. Feel free to ask any questions or inquire about implementation support from me if needed.</p>

            <p>Hello Perry, I have a recurring inquiry regarding DataStream: Is there a way to strategize for varying preventive maintenance (PM) schedules and inspections within an operational protocol? Specifically, I am interested in how to coordinate the maintenance of a main pump alongside a backup pump. For example, the main pump may run for 12 weeks before needing maintenance for 1 day, followed by 2 weeks of downtime. During this time, the backup pump takes over for 2 weeks before also requiring 12 weeks of downtime. Scheduled vibration monitoring (PdM wo's) is conducted for both pumps during their respective operating periods in a continuous 24x7 environment like an oil refinery. Can you provide any case studies or examples of how this dual scheduling system is successfully implemented? Thank you.</p>

            <p>While there is no built-in MP2 feature to automate this process, there are a few suggestions to consider. Firstly, you can set up your preventive maintenance tasks based on meter readings. Additionally, you can manage the status of pumps by toggling them in and out of service within the equipment module when physically needed. Consider integrating this step into your work order process for starting and stopping pumps, which will pause "In Service (normal use)" tasks. Remember to adjust the "Next Due" date for related tasks when equipment is back in operation. If you have any inquiries or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.

            <p>Steven, I'm operating under the assumption that you conduct your preventive maintenance based on time periods rather than running hours or EOH's. This practice may not be common nowadays, but I believe it is essential to ensure optimal equipment performance. Unfortunately, I do not have access to my test environment currently, but I recommend the following steps: 

1. Make sure to update the equipment status in the asset tab when taking it offline and enable it once it is "installed". 
2. Verify the preventive maintenance tasks. 
3. Based on the observations, conduct additional tests if necessary. 

Once you have a clear understanding of the program's behavior, it is crucial to establish a process that streamlines the offline-to-online transition of assets. This may involve using flex-sql for database management or implementing triggers on the asset table to automate the process. If you encounter any difficulties or have further questions, feel free to contact me at 1-809-399-5730 (please note this is a Dominican Republic phone number). 

If this is a priority for your organization, we can discuss potential solutions and provide a detailed quote. I am prepared to develop a customized solution, demonstrate it via WEBEX, and integrate it into your system efficiently.</p>
