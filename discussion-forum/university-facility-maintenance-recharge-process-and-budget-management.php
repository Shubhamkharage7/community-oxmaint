            <p>Inquiring about university website operations? Can you shed light on your RECHARGE process and budget management strategies? The Facilities Maintenance department often seeks to recover costs by charging customers, particularly in the education sector. In my experience working in a Facilities Services Dept in a manufacturing setting, we employ a similar practice by reallocating expenses to the requesting department or equipment owner. This streamlined method makes chargebacks uncomplicated and efficient.</p>
