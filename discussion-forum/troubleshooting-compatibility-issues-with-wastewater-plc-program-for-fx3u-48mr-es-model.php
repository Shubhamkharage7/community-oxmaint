            <p>I am unfamiliar with the file extension you mentioned. Typically, a GX Developer project includes a folder named "Resource" and consists of four files: Gppw.gpj, Gppw.gps, Project.inf, and ProjectDB.mdb. It is common practice to compress all these files into a zip folder before sharing or archiving a project. If you have a file with a different extension, you can try renaming it to .zip to see if it has been changed to .FX.</p>

            <p>In response to beethoven_ii's question, I have not encountered the file extension FX before. Typically, a GX Developer project includes a folder named Resource and four specific files: Gppw.gpj, Gppw.gps, Project.inf, and ProjectDB.mdb. It is common practice to zip these files together when sharing projects with others or for storage purposes. If you have a file with an unfamiliar extension, you could try changing its extension to .zip to see if it can be opened. Thank you for your response. Regarding the connection between an HMI (Beijer X2 Pro 7) and a FX3U-48MR/ES PLC, the file was uploaded to the HMI, not directly to the CPU. Please refer to the image below for clarification. I apologize for any confusion, as I am new to PLC programming. My goal is to access and review the PLC program stored within this file.</p>

            <p>KingCas mentioned: Thank you for your response. An HMI (Beijer X2 Pro 7) is currently linked to the serial port of the FX3U-48MR/ES. The file was uploaded to the HMI, not directly to the CPU. Please refer to the image below for clarification. My apologies for any confusion, as I am new to PLC programming. My goal is to access and view the PLC program within that file. I am not familiar with this screen type, but I suggest using the IXDeveloper program to access the project. You can find more information about this software in another thread discussing Beijer iX and Information Designer.</p>

            <p>A while back, I vaguely recall a similar situation where files were uploaded from a PLC to an HMI and saved on a USB stick. It seems like these files consist of hex values representing raw data from the PLC's compiled program, making it difficult to open. In some cases, PLC files created in programs like GXDeveloper are decompiled on the screen, converting mnemonics like LD X0 to hex codes. Siemens S5 operated this way, while Mitsubishi IDEs may not recognize these file types. To access the project from the PLC directly, one may need to disconnect the HMI and use GX Developer (if it's not password protected). Without the symbolic file, usually not downloaded due to lack of necessity or memory limitations, re-instating the program without GXDeveloper or other IDEs may be challenging. Beijers offers a similar feature for older E series, allowing the HMI program to be copied and downloaded without the E designer. This option does not allow reconstruction in EDesigner but provides a way for customers to replace an HMI without revealing the source file. This method likely helps protect intellectual property rights held by the original OEM.</p>

            <p>In a previous occurrence, there was a similar situation where a file was uploaded from the PLC to a USB stick via the HMI. This file likely consists of hex values representing raw data from the PLC's compiled program, making it impossible to open. When a PLC file is created in programs like GXDeveloper, what appears on the screen is a decompiled file translated from mnemonic code to hex code. The PLC's interpreter understands the hex code. While Siemens S5 follows this process, Mitsubishi IDEs do not recognize this file type. To potentially access the program, one could disconnect the HMI and upload the project directly from the PLC using GX Developer, assuming no password protection is in place. Retrieving a symbolic file is necessary to understand any comments, which may not have been downloaded due to lack of necessity or memory constraints. This method could enable program reinstatement without relying on GXDeveloper or other IDEs, similar to how Beijers handles older E series HMIs. This process allows for downloading a copy of the HMI program without needing the EDesigner, safeguarding the source file's integrity. Most likely, the original OEM has secured the program to protect intellectual property. Accessing the PLC program may prove challenging without breaking through the keyword protection set by the OEM.</p>
