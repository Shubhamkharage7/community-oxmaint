            <p>Effective asset management relies on the collaboration of all stakeholders involved. To enhance reliability and ensure smooth operations, a dedicated reliability engineer or maintenance department should serve as the central coordinator. Ultimately, efficient lifecycle asset management will benefit both the plant manager and the company shareholders.</p>

            <p>Terry, you've posed some excellent questions. Allow me to provide my responses, which are indicated in italics below: 1) Who is the owner of the asset? That would be me and only me! 2) Who operates the vehicle? I do, as well as anyone else I give permission to. 3) Who handles maintenance? I take care of simple tasks like cleaning and adding fluids, but for more complex maintenance, I rely on a professional mechanic. 4) Who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)? The manufacturer of the vehicle. 5) Who creates the maintenance plan? Unfortunately, it's usually the OEM. 6) Who is accountable for implementing the maintenance plan? Ideally, it should be me, but I often defer to the OEM and mechanic. 7) Who is responsible for safety? It should be me or the driver, but some responsibility is entrusted to the mechanic as well. 8) Who ensures the reliability of the vehicle? It's starting to feel like a confession now! 9) Who ensures the availability of the vehicle? Definitely not my spouse! 10) Who reaps the greatest benefits from effective life cycle asset management? It's all about me, but when things go wrong, it's easy to shift blame to the OEM.</p>

            <p>When determining responsibility for reliability, it is important to consider the perspectives of everyone involved. Operations and Maintenance are both essential for equipment to run reliably, with guidelines from the OEM providing a starting point for maintenance. Safety is a collective responsibility, as is the overall maintenance and operation of assets. Effective life cycle asset management benefits everyone in the organization by ensuring job security and keeping the plant running smoothly. Decisions made by any individual in the organization have ripple effects that impact the entire operation. It is crucial for everyone, from Maintenance to Operations to Management, to work together towards the common goal of maintaining plant reliability. Remember, every decision made within the organization has a far-reaching impact on numerous individuals, highlighting the interconnected nature of plant operations.</p>

            <p>In the realm of reliability, the question "Who is accountable?" often leads to the conclusion that everyone plays a role. While this reasoning has its merits, some believe that collective responsibility may result in a lack of accountability. Throughout each stage of a project, specific individuals may be assigned responsibility, with various people shouldering different aspects over the project's lifespan. However, the pivotal figure who ultimately holds accountability is the asset owner. Although tasks may be delegated, the asset owner retains overall responsibility for the project.</p>

            <p>Quote from Vee: James, I appreciate your perspective, but I believe that when everyone is accountable, no one truly is. I agree with your definition. When I say everyone should take responsibility, I mean that just like safety is a collective effort, so should be reliability. We cannot deny responsibility for safety when accidents occur - we examine the actions and decisions leading up to the incident. In the same way, each individual should take ownership of reliability. Just as we prioritize safety in meetings, we should also focus on reliability. People often discuss reliability issues without realizing it, such as outages or production failures. Every decision impacts reliability, whether positively or negatively. It can be challenging to ensure this understanding reaches all levels of an organization, but a reliability program must be driven from top management for true success. I acknowledge that this may seem like a dream, as many companies may struggle to prioritize reliability before it's too late. It's a hope that I may be proven wrong.</p>

            <p>Who benefits the most from effective life cycle asset management? The primary beneficiary is the asset owner, with private planes, yachts, and mansions being examples of potential assets. For your car, proper management can extend its reliability and defer the need for costly investments in the future. Additionally, skilled maintainers who excel in their roles will soon be in high demand due to a shortage of qualified personnel. Asset owners who fail to implement best practices may find maintenance professionals seeking opportunities elsewhere, as skilled individuals become increasingly sought after. In the business world, leaders who understand the importance of integrating maintenance with economic strategies will attract top talent, while those who lag behind may struggle to retain qualified staff. Choosing to rely on an asset owner with subpar maintenance support could ultimately result in high costs, low production volume, and potentially, acquisition or bankruptcy. It is important to consider these risks and plan accordingly to safeguard your family's future. Share your thoughts on this perspective. - Terry O</p>

            <p>Responsibility for availability lies with both the Operator and the Asset Owner. Just like with your car, it is important to determine the level of availability you desire. Operating your vehicle responsibly involves scheduling maintenance and adhering to inspection and detection protocols. The Asset Owner must establish availability standards, while the Operator must ensure the system is accessible for the necessary inspections and detections to achieve those goals. The Maintainer is then responsible for meeting these requirements. Stay tuned for more information in the upcoming discussion. Share your thoughts in the comments below! Terry O.</p>

            <p>When it comes to ensuring safety, everyone has a role to play. Unlike reliability, where extensive explanations may be needed, safety is something that all individuals are already familiar with. Asset owners make it clear that safety is a top priority, and everyone is expected to adhere to safety measures. This strong emphasis on safety by leadership ensures that safety protocols are followed diligently, even when it may be challenging. - Terry O.</p>

            <p>I truly appreciate the feedback, Terrence. It is crucial to understand that when I emphasize the importance of everyone being accountable for reliability, it is not simply about providing training and expecting success. What I mean is that instilling a culture of reliability across all employees, whether salaried or hourly, leads to better decision-making processes. This culture should be driven from top management down to ensure success.

For example, as a maintenance mechanic, I understand that a small adjustment can have a significant impact on the reliability of an asset. If I am aware that the reliability of the assets I maintain directly affects my raises, I am more likely to take ownership and care for them properly. In order to foster a sense of ownership in the maintenance department, several components are essential:

1. Responsibility for a specific area or asset base, providing a clear "playing field" for work.
2. Accountability for performance in that area, encouraging individuals to strive for excellence.
3. Access to appropriate tools to perform the job effectively.
4. Adequate time to maintain equipment properly, without being rushed by production demands.

This is not an exhaustive list, as training, team building, and a clear understanding of the plant's goals also play a crucial role in fostering reliability. Every role within an organization, whether it be maintenance, operations, management, or supervision, plays a part in maintaining reliability. It is essential for everyone to understand that reliability is a collective responsibility.</p>

            <p>James, I hope my straightforward approach doesn't come off as disrespectful. It can be challenging to convey nuances through written posts, unlike in face-to-face conversations. As I write this, I want to emphasize that I am approaching this discussion with utmost respect. I am seeking to spark a conversation to shed light on some recent reflections I've had, and your feedback will help me organize my thoughts. I welcome opposing viewpoints.

I agree that everyone involved should take responsibility for reliability in the chain. The issue in our conversation lies in determining who has the authority or control. While I acknowledge my responsibility in addressing World Hunger, my individual actions may have limited impact on those suffering today. Ideally, if every person took accountability for world hunger, the problem could be solved. However, the government, with its custodial authority, plays a larger role in daily hunger conditions than I do. They possess the power to either perpetuate or eliminate the issue.

In my perspective, the Asset Owner plays a crucial role in setting the standard for reliability, even if they may not realize it. Maintainers then respond within the framework of that standard. Your insights on achieving reliability where you have influence are commendable. The key phrase here is "where you can have influence." I maintain that Asset Owners, Designers, and Operators collectively impact 70%-90% of factors affecting reliability. While maintainers contribute around 10%-30% of the potential impact, a collaborative effort is essential for reliability. Does this reasoning resonate with you? Terry O</p>

            <p>Terrence O'Hanlon expressed himself directly, emphasizing the challenges of conveying nuances in written communication compared to verbal interaction. Just like smiley icons were created to add tone to text, dramatic dialogue can effectively convey the message. His examples serve to deepen our understanding of industry concepts, but they only scratch the surface of the vast scope of the industry. Our familiarity with certain aspects is influenced by what we are exposed to and what we have learned. This reflective dialogue signifies the importance of continuous learning and dialogue in the industry.</p>

            <p>In his Theory of Constraints, Eli Goldratt emphasizes the importance of every link in the chain, a concept that can be applied to Safety and Reliability. Each contributor in the process, whether it be the designer, operator, maintainer, vendor, or asset owner, plays a crucial role in achieving optimal reliability. While everyone is responsible, ultimate accountability lies with the Asset Owner. The traditional salami-slicing approach to management, as seen in Taylor's Scientific Management and Henry Ford's methods, has been proven ineffective by Toyota's holistic approach. Setting clear goals and providing proper training and motivation is key to success, with the Asset Owner taking charge of these responsibilities. The shift towards goal-setting regulations in the UK after the Piper Alpha incident reflects the importance of this approach in achieving sustainable results.</p>

            <p>The concept of constraints theory highlights the crucial need for organizations at all levels to recognize the significance of maintenance reliability. In today's competitive landscape, companies cannot afford to view maintenance solely as a necessary expense or a necessary evil. It is essential for businesses to move away from viewing maintenance as a yearly budget item and instead focus on building a long-term strategy for maintenance processes. By constantly changing direction and prioritizing short-term goals over long-term reliability objectives, organizations risk losing focus and decreasing productivity. It is imperative for reliability goals to remain consistent and not be swayed by fleeting trends or quick fixes, as this can hinder progress and lead to ongoing challenges within reliability groups. 
I recently had the opportunity to speak with a renowned expert in reliability culture transformation, and I couldn't help but admire his organized and structured approach to driving change. However, I was disheartened to learn that even the most effective strategies can falter without the support of upper management. It became clear to me that in order to truly succeed in improving reliability, we must shift our focus towards securing the backing of key decision-makers within the organization. As someone who is passionate about this topic, I recently attended a training session on reliability and I am eager to continue driving this important conversation forward.</p>

            <p>Dear James, I understand and agree with the sentiment you are expressing. It is important to note that senior management should not be blamed for not supporting reliability or risk management strategies. It is our responsibility to communicate these concepts in a way that resonates with them. For instance, instead of focusing on reliability improvement, we should highlight the potential for increased productivity. Rather than discussing cost effectiveness, we should emphasize the impact on net present value. Senior management may not grasp the significance of safety measures, but they are likely to be more receptive to the financial consequences of overlooking them. By framing our discussions in terms of their priorities, such as forecasting capital maintenance expenses for the future, we can bridge the communication gap. It is crucial for us to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, as many individuals often feel frustrated by their management's lack of comprehension. By tailoring our explanations to their perspective, we can build a more collaborative relationship and ensure that our ideas are effectively conveyed. Warm regards,</p>

Within the Chemistry Department, there are two main courses available: General Chemistry and General Chemistry for students in non-science majors. While the former is tailored for students pursuing degrees in Chemistry or Chemical Engineering, the latter is designed for those in Engineering, Business Administration, Social Sciences, and Education programs. Despite our diverse backgrounds, we all took the same General Chemistry course, affectionately dubbed as the "poets" course by Chemistry and Chemical Engineering students.

            <p>When it comes to reliability, the level of responsibility varies depending on the country and specific contract terms. In the UK, companies like Rail track implemented extensive outsourced maintenance programs worth billions of pounds, with firms such as Balfour Beatty likely involved. This set-up follows the Asset Owner / Asset Manager model, which aims to separate responsibilities. Contracts often assign reliability duties to the asset manager, with penalties for failing to meet Service Level Agreements. Following the Hatfield disaster, legal action was taken against Railtrack's Chairman and contractor representatives for corporate killings, though charges were eventually dropped. This incident prompted revisions to UK laws on Corporate Killing. Regardless of contractual agreements, both the asset owner and manager share responsibility for reliability, necessitating stricter maintenance controls, collaborative contract deployment, and improved monitoring of SLAs. Ultimately, the law dictates that accountability for operating, maintaining, or owning physical assets falls on all parties involved.</p>

            <p>As we delve into discussions about assets, an important aspect to consider is their reliability. When discussing assets, the concept of assurance naturally comes to mind. How do these elements tie together in the realm of asset management, specifically in terms of ensuring smooth operations and managing costs effectively? Let's explore the correlation between assets, reliability, and assurance in the context of asset management's impact on operational efficiency and financial implications.</p>

            <p>When considering reliability, it's crucial to shift perspective from equipment to process reliability. This approach may differ from Moubray's philosophy, but it's important to remember that equipment exists to support the overall process. In the event of equipment failure, the impact on the process must be taken into account to determine the criticality of the asset. For example, if a piece of equipment fails but has minimal impact on the process, its importance is less than something that would shut down the entire operation. It's important to consider various factors in such extreme cases. Just a thought to spark discussion.</p>

            <p>I recently returned and am delighted with the discussions happening here. Daryl, I am not suggesting that maintenance and reliability professionals should blame the lack of involvement or support from asset owners as justification. The language shifts I use come from my Solution-Oriented Asset Reliability presentations, inspired by brief therapy techniques. It is important for us as professionals to effectively communicate the importance of asset management in a language that asset owners can grasp.

As maintenance and reliability professionals, we must focus on what we can control and do our best, even if it may not be everything we desire. However, this does not absolve asset owners of their ultimate responsibility to establish the framework for asset management. Without clear leadership from asset owners, our efforts feel like pushing a rope uphill.

It is possible that asset owners are unaware of their lack of knowledge in this area or they may not fully understand the importance of asset management. They could also be preoccupied with other matters that they deem more critical to cost and uptime. It may be beneficial to start a discussion on the impact maintenance can have on cost and uptime.

In order to effectively convey our message about asset management to asset owners, we need to find new ways to communicate and engage with them. Business case presentations have been made, but they may not be resonating with asset owners who are constantly presented with similar scenarios. Perhaps focusing on quicker returns on investment and providing financial training to maintenance and reliability professionals can improve our approach. Ravi, the end goal of maintenance is ensuring capacity assurance or simply maintaining capacity. Terry O.</p>

            <p>Terry, I understand your point about reaching out to asset owners and grabbing their attention through more immediate methods that affect their financial performance. However, I am uncertain about this statement: "Daryl - I am not enabling maintenance and reliability professionals to blame the lack of involvement or support from asset owners. I do not support the idea of asset owner disengagement, nor do I consider it an excuse for failing in asset management duties. Asset owners can take on various roles, such as the production or operations department in a non-outsourced setting. In contrast, in outsourced arrangements like those within the Highways Agency or Local Council PFI initiatives in the UK, the contractor becomes the asset manager while the institute remains the asset owner. Responsibilities for each party are typically outlined in extensive legal documents, where terms like "good industry practice" are vaguely defined. Despite contractual involvement, asset owners may argue that they are highly engaged but not on a daily basis. In my experience with BP, I can attest that their senior management is acutely aware of the significance of asset management for their financial success and reputation. Best regards,</p>

            <p>In his recent book, "The Maintenance Scorecard," Terry emphasizes the increasing importance of considering factors beyond quarterly profit when evaluating investment returns. Shareholders are now seeking to minimize risks associated with their investments to ensure a sustainable value-based return. The focus on safety, environmental impact, and risk reduction is becoming a central aspect of asset strategies for companies with a significant asset base. Legal changes, shareholder activism, and industry frameworks like PAS-55 are all driving a shift towards proactive risk management in asset planning. This shift is gaining momentum at the board level, as companies recognize the benefits of integrating risk management into their overall asset management approach. As a result, advocating for robust asset management practices is becoming increasingly effective.</p>
