                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I recently encountered a locked controller while trying to upload a program from a contrologix. As an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OME), we typically do not lock the controllers we send out. This is the first time I have encountered restricted access on a controller. What steps do I need to take to connect online with the processor? Do I require the original .ACD file or specific security credentials? I am also interested in understanding the legal implications of this situation. Who holds ownership or rights to the code? Any insights into the legal aspects of this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>In order to access a 'Secured' controller, you must have the password used to secure it. To unsecure it, the Logix security tool will be utilized. The ownership of the code is determined by the contract and may require legal involvement.</p>

            <p>I have been reviewing the online document provided by Rockwell on controller security, which can be accessed at http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/pm/1756-pm016_-en-p.pdf. According to my understanding, the controller can be secured either through a FactoryTalk username and password or by using the Logic CPU security tool with a password. The specific controller in question is a L61 with version 20.012, and based on the manual, it appears that there are two locking options available. When attempting to utilize the CPU security tool by navigating to the CPU and selecting the controller, I encountered a message stating that the controller had timed out. This led to the lock indicator being missing and replaced with a question mark. At this point, it seems that the controller may have been locked using one of the two methods. If there are any errors in my understanding, please feel free to correct me.</p>

            <p>As far as I know, the CPU Lock tool may not work after version 19. Earlier versions required the use of the security emulator for FT security. It's my understanding that from version 21 onwards, there is a direct link to FT security. In the past, older software versions typically used standard passwords like 5 and 500. The error you're encountering may be due to the CPU lock tool not being supported in version 20.012.

Based on your original post, it seems like your company may have created this code and your customer has locked it. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. Are they able to unlock it, or does the code belong to a different company that has protected it? In any case, if it's secured using either method, you'll need the password and/or encryption keys to bypass it. Unlike in the past, there's no secret Rockwell backdoor to circumvent this security measure. If you lose your password or keys, you'll need to wipe the unit and start from scratch.</p>

            <p>Although we did not produce this machine, we are integrating it to transmit variables. As an experiment, I generated a fresh project in Logix5000 and attempted to activate security measures. However, upon approving the new controller, I encountered an error message stating "Failure to create project. Access is denied. Access to the RSLogix 5000/Secure Controller requires action to secure a controller, with error code 716-80043b28."</p>

            <p>hackj0632 mentioned that our company did not produce this specific machine. Instead, we are focusing on integrating them to transfer variables between systems. As a fun experiment, I created a new project in logix5000 and attempted to activate security permissions. However, I encountered an error message stating "failure to create project. access is denied. Access to the rslogix 5000/secure controller. action is required to secure a controller error 716-80043b28." This issue appears to be 10 years old but I recently experienced it on multiple machines running Windows 10 with Studio versions V30 through 36. Have you identified the root cause or found a solution? I suspect it may be related to a group policy restriction, but I am unsure.</p>
