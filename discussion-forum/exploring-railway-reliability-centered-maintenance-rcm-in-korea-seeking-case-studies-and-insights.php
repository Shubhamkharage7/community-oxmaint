                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, as the leading railway RAMS consulting company in Korea, we have successfully implemented RAMS in railway systems. We are now looking to introduce RCM to the railway system in Korea for the first time. We anticipate that RCM will have a significant impact on reducing maintenance costs effectively. However, due to a lack of similar cases in Korea, we are facing some challenges in implementing RCM. We are seeking information on RCM case studies for the railway industry and other sectors. If you have any insights, suggestions, or case studies that showcase how RCM can effectively reduce maintenance costs, we would greatly appreciate your input. Please feel free to email me at jrok@microtrack.co.kr. Thank you, Jeong-Rok Choi.</p>
