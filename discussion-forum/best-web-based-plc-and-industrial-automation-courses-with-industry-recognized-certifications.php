            <p>Hello! I am also based in Ireland and I had the opportunity to attend the RSLogix5 Part 1 and Part 2 courses at Rockwell Automation in Birmingham last year. Although there is a location in Dublin, they do not offer as many courses due to low attendance. Both courses are BTEC accredited, with 50% accreditation for each part. I highly recommend these courses, but they come at a high cost. If your company is willing to cover the expenses and time off, it would be worth attending. Each part costs around £1000, not including additional expenses like flights and accommodations.</p>

            <p>Allow me to highlight the Company's offerings: Rockwell Software provides online versions of their RSLogix 5 and 500 courses. These courses can be found at http://training.software.rockwell.com/WebUPublic/default.asp. Take a closer look at them. While they are labeled as "Certification Track" classes, it is unlikely that they align with the USA or Irish continuing-education credit systems. For official credit, one may need to explore options at local community colleges.</p>

            <p>Chakorules mentioned a website recommendation, but I hesitated after seeing the previous post. The site I was considering is a paid service, and I have no affiliation with them. Hello Chakorules, I'm catching up on all the posts. A former friend posted a link to his system integration company in multiple threads, which seemed more like a free advertisement than a helpful response. I removed the link as it didn't address the questions raised. Providing links is fine if they offer solutions, but blatant ads don't benefit the community. Let's avoid turning this community into a spam-filled platform. If your link answers a question, feel free to share it. Share useful information, but avoid free advertising. I hope this clarifies the situation, and I apologize for any confusion. Enjoy, Phil.</p>

            <p>I want to make it clear that my former friend, Mangal, shared a link to his system integration company in three different discussion threads without adding any valuable input or solutions to the questions being asked. It appeared to be more of a promotional tactic rather than a genuine attempt to assist others. As someone who doesn't endorse paid advertisements on my platform, I had to remove the link. Unfortunately, this means I won't be getting that new mansion, yacht, or shiny new plc I had my eye on. Phil, thank you for addressing the issue and for your support. I appreciate your contributions to our community.</p>

            <p>It's hard to believe how quickly time has passed – this thread is now more than two decades old. It's unlikely that the original contributors are still active here. As someone who now encounters young professionals at work who weren't even born when this thread began, my recommendation is to explore the PLC tutorial available on this platform. Additionally, seek out more recent discussions on courses, utilize free resources on platforms like YouTube, and consider affordable online courses on sites like Udemy. These resources can help you stay current and expand your knowledge in the field of programmable logic controllers.</p>
