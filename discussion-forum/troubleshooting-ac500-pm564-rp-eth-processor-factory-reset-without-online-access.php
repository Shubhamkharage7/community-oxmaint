            <p>Hello everyone! I have a ABB PM564-RP-ETH programmable logic controller that was password protected a decade ago. Unfortunately, I no longer have the password and am unable to connect online without it. As a result, I need to reset the PLC to its factory settings, including removing the password. Is there anyone who can provide guidance on how to accomplish this? I have checked the documentation, but there is no information available. Thank you in advance for any assistance!</p>
