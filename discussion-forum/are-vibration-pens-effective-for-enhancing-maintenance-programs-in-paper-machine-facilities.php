                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>We are considering equipping our tradespersons with basic vibration pens, such as the SKF marlin pen, to enhance our maintenance program at our 2-paper-machine facility. Currently, our well-established Condition Monitoring (CM) group utilizes CSI 2130s for fault finding. Our Vibration Analysis (VA) technicians primarily focus on fault finding and we aim to allocate more of their time to root cause analysis and advanced vibration analysis techniques such as Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) analysis, calender barring studies, and oil analysis. 
Our plan is to have tradespersons conduct vibration pen measurements on less critical equipment like basic pumps, fans, and agitators every 4 weeks, while reducing the frequency of Vibration Analysis technician visits to every 6 months. This will allow them to maintain accurate databases while focusing on more advanced tasks. 
However, our VA technicians have expressed concerns about potential equipment failures being missed by the vibration pens, as well as an increase in false alarm requests from tradespersons. We are seeking insights from other facilities that have implemented similar strategies to learn from their experiences. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Our operations utilize pens for data collection at our facility. However, one recurring issue we face is the inability to locate the specific beam in the control room where the pens are placed for measurements. Consistency in data collection is crucial, which is why we have marked the equipment with yellow dots to indicate the designated point. Surprisingly, half of the pens have gone missing without anyone noticing. It seems our pen users are struggling to find the designated spot. It's important to address this issue to ensure accurate and consistent data collection.</p>

            <p>I always recommend to my clients that they invest in SKF pens or another trusted brand of overall vibration meter to assess their own work. By comparing before and after readings on coupling and belt alignments, they can ensure quality control. Although overall readings may not be the best indicator of emerging issues, I've observed a decrease in overall velocity readings when a bearing is failing. Trending the data from the pens can be cumbersome, requiring a return to manual recording methods. Even inputting the data into a PDA for analysis can be time-consuming and provide minimal value in my opinion. Regards, John J.</p>

            <p>When using vibration pens, it's important to address potential usage issues, as Aubrey pointed out. For instance, an Operations Manager had operators regularly check motor and pump temperatures with an infrared gun, marking each location with a dot. However, this method had drawbacks in terms of obtaining consistent readings, which I raised with the Operations Manager. Despite his lack of concern for consistency, he emphasized that major discrepancies would still be noticeable. Additionally, having operators physically visit machine areas instead of staying in the control room was seen as a benefit.</p>

            <p>Hello Planty, I recommend skipping the pens as they are costly and may not provide much value beyond pleasing your SKF representative. Instead, consider investing in a more efficient approach such as using a 2130 to gather accurate data during routine machine visits. Another option is to create a simplified route focusing on key points on the motor and pump to save time while still detecting bearing faults. This can streamline data collection and analysis, allowing for less frequent full routes and analyses, possibly every 3 months. Start by increasing the inspection interval for non-critical machines to 2 months and adjust as needed. Regards.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your responses. Our current technologies include VA, Thermography, Airborne Ultrasonics, and Oil Analysis. Airborne ultrasonics are primarily used for detecting air leaks, but they also have potential for detecting bearing failures, steam traps, and motor arcing. We are working on further developing its applications in these areas. I am interested in learning more about using airborne ultrasonics as a first-pass alternative to VA. We recently purchased vibration pens and I am curious to hear about any success stories with using them. Some maintenance consultant companies also advocate for their use. Cheers!</p>

            <p>Vibration pens have a limited frequency range, making it important to use additional tools for detecting mechanical problems. During a recent inspection of a turbine-driven fan with high vibration levels detected by a vibration pen, I discovered extremely high gearmesh vibration in the gearbox, a serious issue that the pen couldn't detect. Further investigation revealed that the gearbox bearings were installed upside down, causing the fan vibration. Ultimately, rebuilding the gearbox resolved the issue. This highlights the limitation of relying solely on a vibe pen for comprehensive data analysis in maintenance inspections.</p>

            <p>Vendor Alert: Evaluating the Use of Vibration Pens for Data Collection

When it comes to collecting vibration data, there are two key points to consider. Firstly, is it worthwhile to invest in overall metering devices like vibration pens? Secondly, can operators or lubrication technicians effectively gather vibration data that is actually beneficial? In my opinion, the answer to the first question is likely a negative one, while the answer to the second question is critical for the future of routine vibration data collection.

With over a decade of experience in implementing operator-driven reliability (ODR) and lubrication management (LM) programs, particularly in the pulp and paper industry, as well as in refineries and chemical plants, my organization has witnessed the importance of utilizing operators and lube techs to collect sensor-based data such as vibration or temperature. While visual or meter data collection remains a primary focus, the drawbacks of overall meters have been well-documented in our white paper.

Although there are challenges associated with using operators and lube techs for data collection, it is a viable option when compared to having no data at all. The reliability of data collection equipment is currently a major concern, especially when operators may not realize the fragility of equipment like accelerometers.

For further insights, please refer to our attached white paper, which despite being a few years old, still holds true to its significant findings. In the ever-evolving landscape of data collection, it is crucial to address these challenges for optimal results.</p>

            <p>Planty mentions a specific type of "pen" known as the Marlin Pen, officially called the MCD Machine Condition Detector. This tool uses a magnetic base, ensuring a consistent reading. It includes LED indicators for two levels of alarm regarding Acceleration, Velocity, Enveloping, and Temperature, and is inherently safe. However, at its current price point, it falls within the range of a single channel FFT analyzer with more features. While traditional pens had limitations, modern portable units typically incorporate a magnetic base or an external sensor to offer a wider frequency range (often aligned with ISO standards) and improved repeatability. The outdated CMVP40/50 SKF pens are no longer available. For a glance at the latest options available, visit: http://www.reliabilitydirectst...tion-Meters-s/55.htm.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. What is the suggested frequency for vibration pen measurements and VA technician visits in the maintenance program described?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Tradespersons are recommended to conduct vibration pen measurements every 4 weeks on less critical equipment, while VA technician visits are reduced to every 6 months. This approach aims to maintain accurate databases while enabling VA technicians to focus on more advanced tasks.</p>
