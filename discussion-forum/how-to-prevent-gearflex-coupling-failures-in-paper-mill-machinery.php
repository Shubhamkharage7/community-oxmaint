                    <p>Our paper mill has been facing frequent coupling failures on paper machine drives and disc refiners. The Falk gearflex style couplings we use are lubricated with multipurpose grease, as advised by our lubricant supplier. The failures are due to significant wear on the hub and cover teeth, leading to a locked coupling and higher motor vibration. Although we ensure laser alignment in all installations, the issue persists. Are there any recommendations for a more effective lubricant for this type of coupling? Share your successes with us.</p>

            <p>In my experience, failures of gear type couplings are often caused by misalignment or inadequate lubrication, or a combination of both. Misalignment leads to increased sliding velocity along the tooth flanks, which can surpass the capabilities of the lubricant being used. While you mention that misalignment may not be an issue due to laser alignment in all installations, can you guarantee this with 100% certainty? Have you personally observed the alignment process and been satisfied, or did you simply receive a report of the measurements? Considering the possibility of multiple machines experiencing failures, it may be worthwhile to thoroughly scrutinize the lubricant being used. Reflect on whether these failures could be linked to a change in lubricant type or formulation, even if the names remain the same. Instead of solely relying on the lubricant supplier, consult the coupling manuals or reach out to the coupling manufacturer for their updated recommendations. While different lubricants may seem similar in classification, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) may have specific concerns based on past experiences. I recall an instance from my time at an OEM where using a certain turbine oil in high-speed gearboxes consistently led to excessive foaming issues. John from PA.</p>

            <p>I agree with John's suggestion to compare the recommended grease from the coupling OEM to what the lubricant supplier suggests. Speciality coupling greases may be more suitable than general multipurpose greases for optimal performance. It is important to identify the best type of grease for your specific coupling application.</p>

            <p>Falk suggests utilizing their unique coupling grease to combat the issue of bearing greases centrifuging and separating the soap from the oil. The larger diameter and higher rotation speed of the coupling can exacerbate this problem. Furthermore, Walt Strong has successfully detected coupling wear using air-borne ultrasonics. For more information, explore discussions on the vibration forum where his insights can be found.</p>

            <p>Thank you to everyone for your responses. Our most recent issue occurred with a Disc Refiner that had a 400 H.P. motor rotating at 900 rpm. The motor was properly aligned during installation 18 months ago, as confirmed by my own observation of the alignment results. However, a preliminary check before replacing the damaged coupling revealed that the motor coupling was .017" lower than it should be, indicating that the motor had shifted. Upon further investigation, we discovered that the support foundation was in very poor condition, with cracked welds on the transition base allowing the motor to run misaligned despite the initial alignment. This serves as a reminder to regularly inspect and maintain the foundation of your machinery, as things may not always be as sturdy as they seem. In addressing other coupling failures, I have convinced management to switch to the recommended coupling grease instead of using multipurpose grease. Thank you for your valuable contributions.</p>

            <p>Laser alignment is a common method used for achieving precise alignment, but it seems like there may be an issue with the lubricant being used. Additionally, some refiners have specific axial settings that must be exact, and I have encountered issues with setup in that area - it may be worth checking the axial dimensions.</p>

            <p>When it comes to ensuring optimal performance and longevity of your equipment, it's crucial to prioritize the correct foundation, spacing, alignment, and lubrication. Following the manufacturer's specifications for coupling alignment is essential to prevent issues like separation. With years of experience working on refiner applications with brands like Falk/Waldron and Koppers, proper maintenance is key. Additionally, be cautious not to overfill lubricant to prevent any potential hydraulic effects.</p>

            <p>Hello David, it's possible that the alignment is too perfect, causing potential issues with lubrication for the gear teeth. It's important to note that these couplings actually require a small amount of misalignment for proper lubrication. I recommend checking the installation instructions for more information on this. It might be helpful to reach out to the coupling manufacturer for clarification on this matter. Just a heads up, I haven't had the opportunity to install one of these in a long time.</p>

            <p>In the 1980s, we encountered multiple failures of Zurn Amerigear couplings at a nuclear power plant. Despite good alignment, the couplings experienced speed variations causing the grease to be squeezed out of the contact points. It was crucial to use the right type and quantity of grease to prevent imbalance or underlubrication. We found success in utilizing infrared thermography to detect hotspots on the coupling surface before failure, allowing us to take proactive measures. Infrared, ultrasound, and vibration analysis can effectively work together to monitor the health of such couplings. Additionally, analyzing the grease during equipment shutdown helped us identify issues like fretting wear caused by underlubrication. Understanding the root cause and utilizing monitoring tools mentioned here can be beneficial for similar situations. Rich Wurzbach MRG Power Labs.</p>

            <p>Grease is likely the main issue when it comes to lubricated couplings. After extensive testing, we have found that the recommended coupling grease, as specified by the supplier, is the most effective lubricant for ensuring proper lubrication. It is crucial for the grease to stick to the teeth and hub in order to effectively lubricate the coupling. Using a multipurpose grease may not provide adequate lubrication and could potentially lead to leaks from the coupling seals. We recommend trying the specified grease in a few applications to see the difference. With over 60 years of experience, our machinists have learned that using multipurpose grease for convenience sake is not a reliable long-term solution.</p>

            <p>Having experience working at multiple large industrial sites, I have observed that using "multi-purpose" grease in couplings often leads to premature failures. The key factor that sets grease intended for coupling use apart is the addition of a "tacky" substance. This, combined with a viscous base oil, prevents the grease from separating and being forced out from between the teeth. Many reputable lubricant manufacturers offer specialized coupling grease products, with most closely resembling Falk's LTG, commonly included with couplings.</p>

Switching to a high-quality overbased calcium grease, such as the one manufactured by VIP Lubricants in Timmins, Ontario, can often solve similar problems. This type of grease is known for its effectiveness in wet environments and high temperatures. Additionally, consider utilizing ultrasound technology to trend your rotating equipment.

However, errors in coupling installation and lack of proper maintenance can significantly impact machine reliability, leading to increased loads and vibrations in both the driving and driven machines.
