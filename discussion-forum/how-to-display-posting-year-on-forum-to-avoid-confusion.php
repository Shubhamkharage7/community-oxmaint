                    <p>Hi Terry, is there a way to include the posting year on the forum? I've noticed some threads being replied to recently that were actually started a year or more ago. One specific thread even had members asking for a paper from someone who had already retired. Keep up the good work! - Aubrey 

SEO-friendly version:
Hi Terry, I was wondering if there is a way to show the posting year on the forum to avoid confusion. It's frustrating to see recent replies on threads that were actually started over a year ago. One instance even had members requesting a paper from a retired member. Keep up the great work! - Aubrey</p>
