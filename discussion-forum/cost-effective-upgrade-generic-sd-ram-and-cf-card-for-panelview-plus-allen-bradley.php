            <p>When adding third-party components to the terminal, Rockwell Automation will not provide support. While the RAM module is not proprietary, the BIOS may have limited compatibility. The removable CF card is compatible with any brand, but it is recommended to use "MLC" type cards for a longer write life and higher temperature ratings compared to traditional cards. It is advised to use a card under 32 GB and formatted for FAT16. The internal CF card on older pre-v6 terminals contains various partitions with the operating system and other components. It is possible to duplicate these partitions using a Linux computer and the "dd" command, but using Windows-based disk image duplicator tools have not been tested.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach emphasized the capability of duplicating files using a Linux computer and the "dd" command. It is important to understand the responsibility that comes with this power. Mistaking the input and output (if/of) can result in catastrophic consequences, earning the nickname "disk destroyer".</p>

Old terminals with internal CF cards formatted with multiple partitions can have their operating systems and components duplicated using a Linux computer and the "dd" command. Windows-based disk image duplicators have not been tested for this purpose. It is possible to substitute an Allen Bradley SD RAM with a similar one from another manufacturer with the same frequency.</p>

            <p>If you decide to use aftermarket parts with your Rockwell Automation PanelView Plus, keep in mind that Rockwell Automation may not offer support or troubleshooting assistance. While it's worth a try, there is no guarantee it will function properly or be recognized by the terminal. If your PanelView Plus is over 10 years old and utilizes removable RAM modules along with an internal CF card, it is likely out of warranty. However, it may be worth attempting to use aftermarket parts since there is little risk involved.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The issue at hand is the inadequate storage capacity of the CF card or the need for an upgrade in the SD RAM (with only 64MB of RAM and CF storage).</p>

            <p>If you are experiencing issues running a large application on an old terminal, it may be due to limited capacity. It seems like you're attempting to run the application from a USB drive because it cannot be transferred to the CF Internal Memory. One solution to consider is upgrading the RAM module. Since the terminal is no longer under warranty and you have the original module to reinstall, the risk is minimal. A notable advantage of FactoryTalk View ME is the ability to run the runtimes on a standard Windows computer, which typically offers more memory and storage than older terminals. This means you can quickly resume operations, or test and debug applications while waiting for parts, using a laptop or desktop with the appropriate activation keys.</p>

            <p>The terminal is brand new, not old, and the project's .mer file size is 9 MB, with a compact flash (CF) size of 64 MB. After copying the program to the CF, an error message indicating insufficient RAM appears when trying to run it. The same issue occurs when attempting to run it from a USB flash drive, despite successful testing on Windows. The question remains: is the error message related to insufficient memory on the CF or RAM?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>PanelView Plus terminals no longer utilize CompactFlash cards for internal memory since the launch of PanelView Plus 6 in 2016. The smallest capacity version of the original platform, 64 MB RAM, was available until 2012 but has since been discontinued. It seems that the error message you are encountering indicates that the project requires more RAM to run smoothly.</p>
