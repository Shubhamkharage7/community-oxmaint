            <p>The hierarchy of equipment is determined by various factors, including: 1. The standard numbering/tagging system for equipment, which should be established if not already in place. 2. The position of equipment such as pumps or motors, based on guidelines/SOPs within the functional location hierarchy. Motor levels may be below pump levels if the motor is a component of the pump, and at the same level if considered as separate equipment. 3. The Functional Location Hierarchy typically starts from the Country code (for global companies) - Business Unit - Production line - Sub-process line - Master position (equipment number) - Master Position suffix - Sub Master position. This hierarchical structure consists of 8 levels. 4. Each level should contain unique information and adhere to standard conventions. 5. The number of levels in the Functional Location Hierarchy depends on company requirements, Tag numbering, and other factors. 6. Descriptions in the Functional Location Hierarchy should be in capital letters. 7. Linking components in the Functional Location Hierarchy is crucial for CMMS systems and data management. 8. Collaboration among Mechanical, Electrical, Instrumentation, DCS, PLC teams is essential for standardizing the Hierarchy, including data, P&ID diagrams, and sharing knowledge among team members. Good luck! Regards, M. Salman.</p>

            <p>Hello Panuphan, I wanted to discuss the importance of having a solid asset hierarchy from the beginning, especially from a reliability engineer's perspective. Oftentimes, plants are under pressure to start quickly, leading to a lack of focus on proper asset organization. Over time, this becomes an overlooked issue as maintenance, operations, and plant management prioritize other tasks. Consequently, the reliability group is left with a disorganized asset structure in the CMMS. To improve this, I recommend referencing ISO 14224-2006 as a starting point for reevaluating your asset hierarchy. While not perfect, it can help guide you in the right direction.</p>
