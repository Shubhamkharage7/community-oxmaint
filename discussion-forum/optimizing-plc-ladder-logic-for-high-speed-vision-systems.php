                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am gradually establishing myself as the go-to expert for Vision Systems at my facility. The cameras I've been working with seem to have a delay in processing the images, and I suspect it might be due to the logic used. I am curious if anyone has experience with vision systems and if they have any sample code to share. The cameras are marketed as high speed, capturing 4 different images per part. Once the first image is analyzed, the system moves to the next position without a conveyor system. Rather, it is fixed on a fixture holding a metal part, with additional parts being loaded. The camera ensures that all parts are correctly positioned throughout the process. Any insights on this matter would be highly appreciated.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I have implemented a vision system in my plant using Cognex brand cameras, which are compatible with Ethernet/IP and connected to ControlLogix and CompactLogix PLCs. It is crucial to ensure that cameras are fully network compatible with PLCs. I am planning to incorporate a new brand, SICK, into my system, and a representative from SICK recently visited to provide PLC program examples and a camera for testing. Visit the Cognex website (www.cognex.com) for more information and PLC program examples.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>As I continue to establish myself as the go-to expert for Vision Systems at my facility, I have noticed that the cameras I am installing are taking longer than expected to process images. I suspect that the issue may lie in the logic implementation. I am seeking advice from others who have experience working with vision systems and potentially have code samples to share.

The cameras I am using are advertised as high-speed, and I am capturing 4 different images per part. After the first image passes inspection, the tooling advances to the next position on a fixture holding a metal part. Additional parts are then loaded, and the camera verifies their correct positioning throughout the process. Any insights or guidance on this matter would be highly valued.

I suggest considering taking training courses specific to the systems you are using. Vision technology can be intricate, and there are techniques available to streamline image processing. If possible, attend a training session in your vicinity and bring along details of your application for personalized assistance. You may discover methods to reduce processing time and improve efficiency.

It is worth noting that pattern searches can be time-consuming. If you are simply validating the presence of specific features within a defined area, you may achieve faster processing cycles.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to "slow" vision processing, two main culprits are often identified: having a larger-than-necessary field-of-interest and an excessive number of tools. To improve inspection time, it's recommended to narrow down the inspection window to where the specific feature is expected to be found within the camera's field of view.

The number of tools used can also impact processing speed, with more tools typically leading to longer inspection times. However, it is possible to efficiently process inspections even with a sizable number of tools, as I have successfully done in the past.

Ultimately, the speed of vision processing is influenced by various factors such as the camera being used, job configurations, and potential constraints imposed by ladder logic. Without access to your programming details, information about your PLC, and the specific camera model, pinpointing the exact cause of slow processing can be a challenge.</p>
