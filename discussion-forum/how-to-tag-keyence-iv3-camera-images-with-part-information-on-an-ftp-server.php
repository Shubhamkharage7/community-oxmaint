                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am currently using a cell equipped with four Keyence IV3 cameras that are sending images to an FTP server. Additionally, we are applying time, date, and sequenced part number labels to the parts, which are printed after confirming all images from the cameras are of good quality. My inquiry is whether there is a possible method to tag the images with the same information as the label to ensure we are viewing the correct image for the respective part. Currently, we rely on time and date stamps, but have observed discrepancies between the PLC and camera times. This system is crucial for maintaining quality control, as customers can send us a picture of the label if they encounter any problems with a part. We can then locate the corresponding images to confirm the part was in good condition when it left our facility. The label information is generated by the PLC and sent to a Zebra printer once the cameras confirm the images are satisfactory. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When dealing with JPEG images, there are specific attributes within the JPEG protocol that can retain such information. Alternatively, one can embed the label into a vacant section of the image. Another easy solution is to create a text file containing the label details, using the image's filename on the FTP server with a .txt extension added. The most suitable approach will vary depending on the programming tools and application settings for uploading files to the FTP server.</p>

            <p>After conducting some research, I discovered that Keyence offers an AOI that allows for the modification of file names on images when the camera is activated. I integrated this AOI into my program, but encountered a limitation where only 7 characters out of the intended 24 were being transferred. According to Keyence, this AOI should be capable of transferring up to 64 characters. The section of the AOI responsible for copying the filename indicates that the source Target Name is a SINT[64] and the Dest is an INT. Initially set to a Length of 2, it only transferred 4 characters. Adjusting the Length to 10 resulted in 7 characters being transferred, and even when set to 24, only 7 characters were successfully transferred. Any assistance with resolving this issue would be highly appreciated.</p>

            <p>You may need to convert the integer to a character before passing it, unless the AIO is specifically designed to work with integer arrays and perform the conversion internally.</p>
