                    <p>Are you looking for a collaborative solution for a team of engineers working on a single project? I recently set up 2 large SEL RTACs 3555 for our group to create logics. How can a team of engineers effectively collaborate on a project? We currently take turns working on the PLC, using the project description page as a release note, and exporting the project for the next developer. In this day and age, why isn't there a comprehensive software version control solution for PLCs like the ones utilized by professional software engineers?</p>

            <p>In 2024, why hasn't a comprehensive software version control solution for PLCs been developed yet to meet the standards of professional software engineers? Every prosperous business owner began their journey by asking questions like this one.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While some leading companies have adopted multi-engineer strategies, SEL has not followed suit. During my recent years in the industry, I focused on executing several Siemens PCS7 projects. With Siemens, any engineer with a licensed laptop has access to the project on the central server. The only drawback is that work must come to a halt when a download is required.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Steve Bailey pointed out that every thriving business owner began their journey by asking a similar question. There are various solutions available in the market, including options from the PLC brand and others that cater to multiple brands. While I may not have direct experience with the particular model you mentioned, it's worth noting that Siemens offers a solution called Simatic AX. This innovative tool allows you to program your PLC using VS Code, offering all the functionalities you would expect from a powerful code editor (such as scripting, compiler access, and version control).</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In 2024, it is surprising that a comprehensive software version control system for PLCs, similar to what real software engineers use, is not available. Real software engineers typically work with flat ASCII text files, allowing for easy merging of changes without conflicts. However, with PLC software, which often involves monolithic binary files, making individual changes can affect the entire file, making version control more challenging. Existing solutions for specific PLC brands like Siemens may require the source code to be in a flat ASCII format before being converted to a binary file for the PLC. While some systems, like Allen-Bradley Logix's .L5X format, may be XML-like and potentially compatible with version control systems, there are still complexities to consider. Overall, the lack of a universally applicable version control solution for PLCs remains a challenge in the industry.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I agree with drbitboy's points. Is it possible for PLC ladder logic to be displayed as text on the screen instead of pictures? Absolutely. SCL is already in text format, making it an easy transition. Could the hardware/IO settings be stored in a yaml file rather than a binary blob? Certainly. The same applies to HMI screens and configurations. Will future tools consider these needs? Most likely, and hopefully. However, the tools we currently use were developed over a decade ago, if not longer. While some may have complained at the time, few customers expressed significant concern.</p>

            <p>High-quality software is essential for efficient collaboration on large PLC projects. Rockwell's platform enables multiple users to work simultaneously, setting a standard for the industry. Utilizing temporary mutual exclusion locks helps prevent read-modify-write issues. Saving projects in XML format, as mentioned earlier, allows for easier version control by tracking differential changes instead of storing the entire project for each update.</p>
