                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently working on a project that involves loading pallets into 10 test bays and unloading them once testing is complete. To keep track of completed tests, I am utilizing an array and an FFL command to organize the unloading process in a FIFO manner. However, I am facing an issue where the FFL command occasionally fails to load the number of a completed test bay. Approximately 6 out of 100 attempts result in this error. 

Each test bay is equipped with a proximity sensor that detects the presence of a pallet. Once testing is finished, the operator presses a button at the test bay, signaling that the test is complete. When the button is pressed and the sensor senses a pallet, a test complete tag is activated for that specific test bay. This tagged information is then utilized to move the test bay number into a tag, which serves as the input for the FFL command to load into the array.

Despite the successful tagging of test completion, there seems to be a random issue causing the process to malfunction at times. For those interested in examining the routine and troubleshooting the issue, the problematic section can be found at rung 10. Feel free to take a look at the attached routine for further analysis.</p>

            <p>It may seem unlikely, but if multiple TESTBAYn_PB1 buttons are pressed simultaneously during the same scan cycle while their corresponding TESTn_PROX sensors are active, the last bay number value written to TESTBAY_COMPLETE_FIFO_SOURCE will overwrite previous values, causing them to be lost. This can lead to the symptoms you are experiencing. To improve clarity, consider implementing the canonical Start/Stop Circuit pattern. For example, include an XIC TESTBAY1_COMPLETE instruction around the XIC TEST1_PB1 instruction on Rung 10, change the output to OTE TESTBAY1_COMPLETE, and remove Rung 11. This will help streamline the PB+PROX-driven logic.</p>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In a rare scenario, if multiple TESTBAYn_PB1's are activated simultaneously during a scan cycle with their corresponding TESTn_PROX's at 1, the latest bay number entered into TESTBAY_COMPLETE_FIFO_SOURCE will overwrite previous entries, resulting in data loss and the issue you are experiencing. To prevent this, consider using 10 rungs similar to the example below instead of Rungs 10-52 with sequential numbers replacing 'then' with 1 through 10. This approach will ensure that all 10 bays can be completed within a single scan cycle without encountering the mentioned problem. Additionally, a query arises regarding the whereabouts of the FFU instructions.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I believe that multiple push buttons being pressed simultaneously during the same scan cycle is unlikely. These buttons are operated by a single person and are located a few feet apart. Thank you for the suggestion regarding logic implementation; I will test it out to see if it resolves the issue. The FFU is invoked in a separate subroutine. Is it possible for the FFU to be triggered simultaneously with the FFL, causing the FFL to not run properly?</p>
