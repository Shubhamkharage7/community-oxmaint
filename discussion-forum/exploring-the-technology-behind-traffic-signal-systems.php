            <p>It is unlikely that the PLC used is off-the-shelf; it is more probable that a specialized sequencer with limited features is being utilized. This cost-effective solution allows for easy setup by untrained staff, catering to regulations mandated by government agencies. While this is merely speculation on my part, this approach may not be common in the industrial sector.</p>

            <p>When it comes to traffic control systems, it's important to consider dedicated traffic controllers instead of PLCs. There are various manufacturers to choose from, depending on the preferences of your municipality. For example, McCain offers a range of Traffic Signal Controllers & Modules. Interestingly, the state of Washington estimates that the cost of installing a single intersection traffic light is around $500,000. It's mind-boggling how much money is invested in these systems, making you question if you're in the right line of work.</p>

            <p>In the United Kingdom, the processor unit for traffic lights is often compared to a mini Cray-2 supercomputer. These units were traditionally housed in 19-inch racks and controlled basic functions such as signal changes based on traffic flow. Many modern systems now include road sensors to detect vehicles and pedestrians, as well as communication with a central control room for adjusting timing. While some may speculate that modern Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) could be utilized, it is likely that traffic light manufacturers have developed their own specialized hardware for this purpose. A former colleague of mine worked on maintaining traffic lights, and despite not being involved in programming, he acknowledged the complexities involved in managing these systems.</p>

            <p>I have experience working on traffic light systems and controllers, particularly focusing on older, traditional setups with relay panels and data collection systems. Familiarity with NEMA standards for communications and controllers is essential in this field. While some newer, more advanced traffic controllers exist that handle phase lock loops digitally, many cities still prefer mechanical systems for managing light sequences. One example of NEMA standards to be aware of is TS2.</p>

            <p>In the United Kingdom, Siemens is a key player in the implementation of traffic control systems, with the current system known as SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique). There is a growing interest in enhancing this system with "real time optimization" technology, which holds the potential to revolutionize traffic control by enabling communication with intelligent traffic, such as buses. The existing systems rely on sensors or central control to detect and adjust timings in order to optimize traffic flow, especially in busy cities like London.

Siemens is a leading supplier of traffic management solutions in the UK, suggesting that their PLC technology could possibly be integrated into traffic control systems. While the hardware may be customized, it likely builds upon current PLC technology. Timers were not commonly used until the 1990s, as indicated by a friend who encountered an OMRON system that resembled an old S6 PLC. This suggests that such technologies have been in use for some time.</p>

            <p>According to drbitboy, it's worth noting that roundabouts can be a superior traffic solution in certain situations, despite some advocating for traffic lights. The versatility of roundabouts has been proven in various locations globally. Similarly, when considering the use of a programmable logic controller (PLC) for specific functionalities in a large market, the overhead costs may not be justified. Reliability is also a crucial factor to consider, as a risk assessment could determine the need for safety integrity level (SIL) compliant instrumentation over a standard PLC.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea pointed out that there are numerous roundabouts worldwide that contradict the idea of using traffic lights. Have you ever encountered a roundabout with traffic signals? Exceptions exist in every scenario, and in my experience, I have seen them in Livingston, NJ on Route 10, which was quite chaotic - not a typical roundabout but had the potential to be one. Additionally, in Roxbury, NJ, the intersection of Routes 46 and 10 used to have traffic lights but was eventually replaced with a conventional intersection. A sign at the lights used to read, "Traffic lights create gaps in a circle," but in reality, it is intelligent driving that creates these gaps. The issue lies with the drivers, not the roundabout itself. Conversely, the A35-A326-Totton Bypass west of Soton impressed me with how effectively it managed rush-hour traffic, thanks to the skillful drivers utilizing it.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to drbitboy, there are always exceptions to rules, and he experienced it firsthand in Livingston, NJ, USA, at the Route 10 intersection. While not a traditional roundabout, it had the potential to be one. Another example is the Roxbury, NJ, USA, intersection of Routes 46 and 10, which was eventually upgraded to a conventional intersection with traffic lights. Signage near the lights used to state, "Traffic lights provide gaps a circle," emphasizing the importance of intelligent driving to create gaps in traffic flow. Despite encountering selfish New Jersey drivers, drbitboy believes that the real issue lies with driver behavior rather than the roundabout design.

On a positive note, the A35-A326-Totton Bypass west of Soton impressed drbitboy with its efficient handling of rush-hour traffic, thanks to the presence of intelligent drivers. While acknowledging that foolish drivers can be found anywhere, drbitboy also notes the challenge of road capacity, which can lead to congested traffic conditions.</p>

            <p>I found your question on traffic cabinets quite intriguing, Cydog. I, too, have been curious about the equipment used in these cabinets after watching some informative TikToks, as mentioned by Robertmeesaid. The physical security industry is advocating for the upgrade of these cabinets from mechanical key locks to electronic locks with card readers or electronic keys. This push is driven by the fact that many traffic cabinets still use the same easily accessible lock and key system.

It's interesting to note that some car manufacturers, like Audi, have vehicles that can somehow interact with traffic signal systems. I've come across videos showing these cars displaying a countdown to when the traffic light will turn green. How exactly does this technology work?</p>

            <p>Located in Swindon, UK, the unique "Magic Roundabout" features five major roads intersecting. To streamline traffic flow, engineers designed a system where drivers can easily navigate to their desired direction without having to pass multiple intersections. This intricate layout consists of an outer clockwise roundabout with smaller roundabouts at each intersection, guiding drivers into the inner counterclockwise roundabout. Despite being a familiar concept in the UK, the Magic Roundabout is known for its congestion issues, as even seasoned drivers find it overwhelming to navigate.

            <p>The Motorola 6800 processor was recently mentioned in a post I saw. The manual for it was needed, but unfortunately, I lost mine during a move. However, I managed to write my own program for a traffic light system, covering normal functions, left turn lanes, and similar setups to those in Scottsville, KY. I used ladder logic and structured text for this project, including parts in subroutines for different conditions. By simply turning on a bit for the desired option, I was able to complete the project after some time. - James</p>

            <p>Gajtguy raised an intriguing question about traffic cabinets, sparking curiosity among others like Cydog. TikToks showcasing equipment in these cabinets have caught the attention of many, prompting discussions about the need to upgrade from mechanical keys to electronic locks with card readers. This shift addresses concerns about the vulnerability of using the same lock/key across multiple cabinets.

Some speculate about the potential for cars, such as Audi, to communicate with traffic signals, as seen in videos displaying countdowns until a light turns green. During a stint working for automotive companies in Germany, there was talk of collaborative software development among manufacturers to integrate Google Maps functionality into future vehicle technology. This innovation aims to enhance traffic flow and safety by enabling cars to remotely communicate their positions without relying solely on onboard sensors.

While reminiscent of V2X technology, the specifics remain unclear. Nonetheless, the concept is undeniably fascinating.</p>

            <p>Cydog inquired about the technology behind traffic signals as the city he lives in is currently seeking a Traffic Signal Technician. Although the salary may be low, the position offers great benefits. Having worked with a government contractor in the MD, DE area installing and maintaining traffic signals and cameras, Cydog was tasked with installing and programming an over height detection system for a tunnel. When he inquired about the technology behind traffic signals, he learned that from the technician's perspective, it was essentially a black box programmed and configured by another company. Despite their lack of in-depth knowledge, the technicians were skilled in swapping parts and changing light bulbs, with some familiarity with PLCs through their work on the over height detection system.</p>

            <p>During my time at university in the mid-1980s, I conducted a traffic study as part of my trigonometry class for extra credit. The study involved verifying that a one-way street in the city was synchronized to a speed of 35 mph using the slope of a line formula, which it was. I now reside in the Detroit area and was informed by a local county worker in Macomb that they recently phased out old traffic signal controllers and components like drum controllers, cams, and microswitches. Despite these updates, many traffic lights still malfunction during heavy rain, causing frustrating delays and backups at intersections. Dealing with these "faulted controllers" during rush hour can be a real hassle. My apologies for the rant.</p>

            <p>Located outside of Detroit, Allen Park boasts a one-mile long shopping center with a single road running through it. At the southern end of the shopping center, the road intersects with a main road where drivers can either turn right to access one expressway or turn left for another. This intersection experiences heavy traffic congestion, necessitating the presence of a police officer stationed in the median next to the traffic light controller. The officer can often be seen sitting on the hood of their car with the controller door open. When traffic flow begins to ease, the officer rises, accesses the cabinet, and switches the traffic light to allow movement in the opposite direction. During weekends, multiple officers take turns manning the traffic lights on manual mode to ensure smooth traffic flow.</p>

            <p>In a recent post, James Mcquade mentioned that the Motorola Processor 6800 was the latest topic discussed. In the post, he mentioned needing a manual, which he unfortunately lost during a move. To stay sharp with programming, James decided to create a traffic light system using ladder logic and structured text in RS5000. He started with basic logic for traffic lights, then added features such as left turn lanes, mainline, traffic counting, and fault detection. It took some time, but he successfully completed the project by using subroutines for different scenarios. Overall, James found the experience to be beneficial for maintaining his programming skills.</p>

            <p>Saultgeorge mentioned his experience working on a traffic lights programming project in RS5000, which helped him stay proficient during slow times. He developed a traffic light system with crosswalk logic, left turns, mainline, traffic count, and fault features. This project made him realize that most traffic controllers have preset logic and are not editable, potentially leading to malfunctions if tampered with.

While acknowledging the expertise of traffic specialists in this field, the complexity of traffic controller products often resembles a PLC control network. A visit to a local government traffic control center during university showed how PLCs are utilized in such systems. It is apparent that these systems are designed with stringent security measures to prevent unauthorized access and modification by individuals unfamiliar with the intricacies of traffic control technology.</p>

            <p>During the late 1970s, I worked the swing shift at Data General, conducting final tests on their minicomputers using an Exerciser/Diagnostic program. I vividly recall working on an older black-faced unit, possibly the Nova 1200, as the current model was the Nova 3. This particular unit was destined for Gothenburg, Sweden for a "traffic control" project and was equipped with a real-time clock option. With the Y2K scare approaching, I couldn't help but wonder if that unit was still operational, overseeing city traffic lights from deep within a municipal building basement, and if it would encounter any issues due to the infamous Y2K bug.</p>
