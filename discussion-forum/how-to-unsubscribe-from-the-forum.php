            <p>Hey Rolly, are you referring to something that V. Narayan said on the forum? Take note of their location! Those residing north of the Border (Scotland) are known for being argumentative OSB's. Just brush it off, as the English have been doing for centuries. This is sure to spark a reaction! Simply laugh it off and move on with your life, as we all have to do at times. Stay positive and keep moving forward!</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by Vee: Hello Rolly, I promptly offered my apologies, however, it seems you did not accept them. Vee, we have had a longstanding relationship across various forums long before encountering these individuals here. Undoubtedly, you are a highly regarded expert in your profession whom I deeply respect and admire. I, on the other hand, am just a humble individual residing in a developing country, barely making ends meet in this field that is not very lucrative. Nevertheless, I persist because my passion lies here. Who am I to converse with someone as esteemed as yourself, Vee? I do not accept your apology for the simple reason that you have done nothing wrong and therefore, there is nothing for me to forgive. In fact, it is I who should be seeking your forgiveness. My hesitancy in communicating stems from the fear of disappointing you. This forum has been a significant part of my life since becoming active – a cozy spot where I engage with like-minded individuals discussing topics of mutual interest, much like a favorite coffee shop or bar. It serves as a meeting ground for people from diverse backgrounds around the globe, united by a shared passion for Reliability and Maintenance. Perhaps it is your natural way of responding, Vee, and I must learn to adjust to it. I apologize for taking some time to understand you better. Vee, may I humbly request, with all due humility, that you find it in your heart to forgive me for overreacting slightly, and I ask that you continue to engage with my posts. We have unresolved debates to tackle, so let's address them head-on. To others, I apologize for appearing too sensitive, even if just a bit. Vee, please know that I will always consider you a friend and a brother. Rolly Angeles</p>

            <p>Quote: People from Scotland are often seen as argumentative individuals known as OSBs, but don't let that stereotype distract you. It's been a long-standing tradition for English individuals to simply brush off such remarks. As someone who hails from north of the border, I can attest to the confusion surrounding the term "OSB." It's interesting to note that the union of the crowns took place in 1707, marking its 300th anniversary this year—a significant event in history.</p>
