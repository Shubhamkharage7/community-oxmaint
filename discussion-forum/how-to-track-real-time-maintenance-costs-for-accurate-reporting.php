            <p>Prepare the report within two months! Differentiate your tasks by category - for example, Preventative Maintenance (PM) tasks may remain relatively stable. It is crucial for Management to track the expenses of significant projects. Reporting should not be a challenge: simply list the number of PM jobs completed at a cost of $10 each, calculate the average, and ensure the deviation is within 20%. Major projects attract attention, particularly when your manager must justify substantial expenses to higher-ups. Planned and unplanned shutdowns, overtime costs, cost avoidance strategies, rushed vendor orders at inflated prices, and frequent equipment breakdowns all present opportunities for enhancing efficiency.</p>

            <p>There are two ways to track and analyze total maintenance costs effectively. The first involves accessing maintenance cost centers within the accounting module to compare planned versus actual expenses. The second method is to calculate the total costs associated with all work orders, including estimated, planned, and actual expenses. It is important to promptly fill out work orders upon completion to ensure accurate reporting of costs. Delayed submission of work orders can result in inaccurate maintenance cost reports, especially for shorter timeframes like monthly reviews. However, work order costs are valuable for conducting long-term cost analyses, such as determining the lifecycle costs of equipment or annual maintenance expenses.</p>

            <p>I agree with Steven and Josh about the importance of summarizing the cost report after 2-3 months. However, my key performance indicator (KPI) requires measuring maintenance costs per product (ton) on a monthly basis. I have addressed this issue with personnel in the CO module, who suggested a similar approach to what Josh initially recommended.</p>

            <p>The issue you're facing with aromatics production seems to be more complex than anticipated. Calculating maintenance costs per ton becomes even trickier when a plant produces multiple products. How many different products does your facility manufacture? To address this challenge, consider organizing maintenance cost centers based on each product line within the plant areas. If this hasn't been done already, consult with the CO department to establish these cost centers. By assigning all work order costs to product-specific cost centers, you can then consolidate them into the Central Maintenance cost center for better management.</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, I've been keeping track of the daily production output in the production department, specifically focusing on the maintenance cost per product ton in the WC (Aromatics process). Do you think it's important to provide this information? As the maintenance information manager, I believe it would be beneficial to develop more data for top management. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you have a single product in your aromatics complex, the process is straightforward. Calculate the total monthly maintenance cost from CO and divide it by the monthly production output in tonnes. It's important to analyze the trend of maintenance cost per ton of aromatics product, rather than focusing solely on the absolute figure due to delayed work order charges. Additionally, consider providing the planned maintenance cost per metric ton of product. By monitoring these metrics, you can effectively manage costs and ensure optimal production efficiency in your aromatics complex.</p>

            <p>Panuphan, I highly recommend getting the book "Developing Performance Indicators for Managing Maintenance" by renowned maintenance expert Terry Wireman, also known as a "maintenance blackbelt." While some key performance indicators (KPIs) created by maintenance professionals may seem unattainable, it's important to recognize the complexity of the technical aspects of the business.</p>

            <p>Steven, I have already read this book and discovered a discrepancy in the financial indicators, specifically in the measurement of maintenance costs per unit produced.

            <p>One important key performance indicator (KPI) we track is the maintenance cost per ton of product, a metric believed to have originated from Dupont. Additionally, at the company level, we closely monitor the production cost per ton of product. This practice goes beyond simple bean counting and plays a crucial role in our strategic decision-making process.</p>
