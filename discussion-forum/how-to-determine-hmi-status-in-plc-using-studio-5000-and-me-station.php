                    <p>Greetings! I am currently utilizing Studio 5000 and ME Station for my project. I am seeking a solution to determine the status of the PC running the HMI - whether it is powered on or shut down. While I have experimented with macros for startup and shutdown, they only seem to detect the HMI's status prior to the PC shutting down. Any guidance or suggestions on this matter would be highly valued. Thank you for your attention and support!</p>

            <p>Have you considered comparing the real-time and date tags to determine if they match? If not, this could indicate a discrepancy. In this case, you can further analyze by comparing the minutes or seconds to pinpoint the difference. This method can help ensure accuracy and synchronization between time stamps.</p>

            <p>I have recently come across this process involving setting up logic in a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The steps involve turning a bit on in the PLC, which is then detected by the Human Machine Interface (HMI). A script is then triggered to set a bit in the PLC. If the PLC detects the bit and sets its bit to zero, the HMI responds by also setting its bit to zero. However, if there is no response from the HMI within 1 or 2 seconds, a fault is created. This process ensures smooth communication between the PLC and HMI systems.</p>

            <p>James Mcquade explained a process involving setting up logic in a PLC using a heartbeat signal. The method involves turning on a bit in the PLC, which is then detected by the HMI to trigger a script that sets a corresponding bit in the PLC to zero. If the HMI does not respond within 1 or 2 seconds, a fault is generated. This can be achieved under the global connections/macro tab by creating a macro to write the bit in the PLC.</p>

            <p>In the past, I have configured Global connections in a PanelView Plus to transfer the /Seconds tag from the terminal to the PLC. If the tag remains unchanged for more than 5 seconds, I trigger an HMI timeout and take appropriate action, such as timestamping a "PanelView Runtime Halted" event in my logic. However, a drawback of this approach is that it clogs the FactoryTalk Diagnostic history with write commands from the PV+. Alternatively, sending a "List Identity" command using a MSG instruction can be effective, but it does not provide a definitive indication that the FactoryTalk View ME application is functioning correctly.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach shared his method for setting up Global connections in a PanelView Plus to transfer the /Seconds tag from the terminal to the PLC. By monitoring for any changes in the tag for more than 5 seconds, an HMI timeout is triggered. This typically results in timestamping a "PanelView Runtime Halted" event in the logic. However, a drawback of this approach is that it can flood the FactoryTalk Diagnostic history with write commands from the PV+. An alternative method involves using a MSG instruction to send a "List Identity" command, though this does not guarantee the correct execution of the FactoryTalk View ME application. The method was successful in achieving the desired results.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. How can I determine the status of the HMI PC using Studio 5000 and ME Station?
- To determine the status of the HMI PC, you can experiment with macros for startup and shutdown in Studio 5000 and ME Station. These macros can help detect the HMI's status prior to the PC shutting down.
  
2. Are there specific features or functions in Studio 5000 that can help monitor the HMI's status?
- While Studio 5000 offers various tools and functionalities for PLC programming, utilizing macros for startup and shutdown can be effective in monitoring the HMI's status within the system.</p>
