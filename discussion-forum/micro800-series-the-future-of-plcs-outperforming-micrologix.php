            <p>The MicroLogix 1000 and 1500 have reached their "end of life" status, but the 1100, 1200, and 1400 models are currently active and popular products. While the 1200 may eventually be phased out, the 1100 and 1400 are expected to remain on the market for a significant period. Some users find programming the Micro800 series challenging, especially those accustomed to using RSLogix.</p>

I have noticed the end-of-life status of these products on Allen Bradley's website recently, as pointed out by Firejo. Despite the appeal of the Micro850, I still have a preference for the MicroLogix 1400s.</p>

            <p>Upon my first impression, I found the software to be lacking, but it is important to note that I only tested it during its initial release. Since then, the software has undergone significant enhancements. It appears that the product is primarily targeted towards the Chinese market and was acquired by AB rather than developed in-house. As a result, it deviates from the standards commonly associated with Logix 500/5000. While this doesn't necessarily deem it inferior, there seems to be a consensus that it does not truly align with the family of products.</p>

            <p>mk42 mentioned that upon their initial assessment of the software, they found it to be lacking. However, they acknowledged that their experience was based on the software's initial release. It has been reported that the software has undergone significant improvements over time. According to sources, it seems the product is primarily targeted towards the Chinese market and it was acquired by AB, rather than developed in-house. The software does not adhere to the typical standards expected by users familiar with logix 500/5000. While this doesn't necessarily make it inferior, there is a consensus that it may not truly align with the existing product line. 

Expressing frustration, mk42 reflected on their past experience with a rebranded Indian HMI/PLC combo and the important lesson they learned from it. They are considering exploring the Micro800 series in the future once it becomes more established, but plan to continue utilizing their ML1400s for smaller-scale projects for now.</p>

            <p>I recall utilizing one of these devices to enhance a control system operating on pneumatic logic gates. We repurposed servo drives and found the indexing motion control to be cost-effective. While it doesn't have the familiar Logix 5xx interface, it was a more budget-friendly option compared to buying a MicroLogix and Rslogix 500, especially since our shop primarily used Logix5000.</p>

            <p>According to mk42, there is a misconception that the Micro800 PLC is primarily targeted towards the Chinese market and was acquired by AB, rather than being internally developed. While it may not align with the standards of traditional Logix 500/5000 PLCs, this does not necessarily mean it is inferior. Rockwell actually designed the Micro800 and its software. It seems that Rockwell may have compromised their high quality standards in an attempt to break into the low-end PLC market. Despite initial challenges with programming, some users find success with the Micro800, making it a polarizing product within the industry.</p>

            <p>Over the past few years, I have extensively utilized the Micro 820, Micro 850, and PanelView 800 series (specifically the 4" model). While early versions of Connected Components Workbench posed challenges, the latest version, CCW V9, has significantly improved its usability. Although I haven't delved into motion control, I have successfully implemented PID, Ethernet/IP connectivity to PowerFlex 525 drives, process control, and programming in various languages such as FBD and ST, with a focus on LAD. Additionally, I have experience in setting up Modbus/TCP communications. Despite some limitations, I find these products satisfactory given their price point. However, when it comes to efficiency and user-friendliness, I prefer RSLogix/Studio 5000 without hesitation.</p>

            <p>Is there a shortage of Micro800 products due to high demand? I recently ordered two 7" PanelView800s and was informed of a month-long lead time for shipment from the Rockwell factory. As a newbie to the Micro800 equipment range, I've noticed that the development options for PanelView are somewhat limited. This is understandable given the competitive pricing. While I am not yet fully acquainted with CCWv9, I am finding that it is taking me longer to complete tasks that were previously quicker to accomplish with FactoryTalk View. As I delve into Micro800 programming, I realize that it will require some time to get used to. It's not necessarily difficult, just different from the Rockwell software I am accustomed to.</p>

            <p>I usually refrain from commenting on debates between X vs Y PLCs. However, I do believe that Rockwell Automation compromised on their standards to compete in the lower-end market with the MicroLogix series. It would have been better if they had given it a different name, considering it is nothing like the 1100/1400 models. The main drawback I see is the difference in software compared to RsLogix 500 or 5000. Transitioning from one to the other is usually smooth, but the 800 series software poses challenges when upgrading to a larger PLC system. It is important to note that only the 1000 and 1500 models are being phased out, but this is not clearly stated on their website, leading to confusion among users. Visit http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Programmable-Controllers/MicroLogix-1000 for more information.</p>

            <p>When it comes to PLC discussions, TWControls usually prefers to stay out of the X versus Y debates. However, it's hard to ignore the fact that Rockwell Automation made some compromises in terms of standards with their Micro800line to compete in the lower end market. The issue arises with the naming of the product as "MicroLogix", as it bears no resemblance to the 1100/1400 counterparts.

One of the main reasons to discourage the use of the Micro800line is the significant difference in software compared to RsLogix 500 or 5000. Transitioning from 500 to 5000 or vice versa is relatively easy, but the software for the 800 series presents a steep learning curve, especially when moving to a larger PLC family.

It's worth noting that only the 1000 and 1500 models are being phased out, despite common misconceptions. The Micro800line, designed for the Asian small machine OEM market, uses cost-effective software suitable for high-volume production. Unlike the Logix products, it targets a different customer base.

Rockwell Automation's intent with the Micro800line was never to provide a seamless upgrade path to the Logix platform. Instead, they aimed to attract new business opportunities that were previously out of reach. It's possible that we may see a "Logix-Lite" product in the future to fill the gap left by the MicroLogix.

The Micro800line is manufactured by Rockwell Automation in Singapore, underscoring their commitment to quality and control over the production process. While seasoned users of Logix 500/5000 may find the Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software challenging, newcomers or those averse to Logix software may find it simpler to use for basic tasks.</p>

While it may not be a Logix product, it serves its purpose well for low volume small machine customers too. The intention behind the creation of the Micro800line was to cater to a new customer base that may not have considered Logix family products. There may be a possibility of a future "Logix-Lite" product to replace the old MicroLogix, allowing compatibility with Studio 5000. Unlike Micro800, an easy migration path to the Logix platform was not part of the original plan. The Micro800line is manufactured by Rockwell Automation in a plant located in Singapore, not China. Users familiar with Logix 500/5000 may find it challenging to transition to CCW, but for those new to AB systems or those who found Logix cumbersome for simple tasks, the Micro800line may be a suitable option.</p>

            <p>Firejo brought up the enduring myth surrounding Rockwell's Micro800 PLC, claiming that Rockwell compromised its high quality standards in an attempt to break into the low end PLC market. Despite initial challenges with programming and technical support, some users have grown to appreciate the Micro800 series. 

I can relate to Firejo's experience, as I too purchased an 810 hoping for a cost-effective alternative to the ML1100. However, my struggles with programming in CCW v1.0 led me to stick with the ML1100. Despite encountering issues with coding, I still monitor discussions and practice with CCW for potential future use.</p>

            <p>Looking for alternatives to the Micro800 series? At my workplace, we have 20 MicroLogix 1000's that need replacing as Rockwell Automation no longer supports them. These PLCs are in separate, unconnected machines performing various tasks. Seeking recommendations for replacements that aren't from RA's Micro800 series. Most of our plant uses RA equipment programmed through Ethernet IP, so sticking with the same brand seems logical. However, if the programming language is a hindrance, it might be worthwhile exploring other options.</p>

            <p>Firejo pointed out that the belief that Rockwell's Micro800 PLCs were a success is a persistent myth. The Micro800 was developed by Rockwell, but the software was created by a subsidiary of the company. It seems that Rockwell may have compromised their usual high quality standards in an attempt to gain a foothold in the low-end PLC market. However, this move may have backfired as initial experiences with the Micro800 were challenging, with even Rockwell's tech support struggling to program them effectively. Despite this, there are still users who appreciate the Micro800 line. Some argue that Rockwell's foray into budget PLCs parallels the American auto industry's attempt to compete with Japanese small cars in the 1970s. It's a product that may not have been in high demand, considering the numerous low-end PLC options already available from other manufacturers. Overall, the Micro800 line is likened to the Ford Pinto or the Chevrolet Chevette in the PLC market.</p>

Hopefully, the new CCW v11 will offer a more intuitive user experience, or perhaps I will become more accustomed to it.</p>

            <p>*bj said: I received confirmation from our distributor as well. Our Rockwell Account Manager is scheduled to meet with me tomorrow to update me on the latest offerings. I plan to inquire further about the Micro870 and any additional information they may have. Initially, he seemed confident about sharing updates, but during our conversation, it became apparent that I was already well-informed about many aspects. Consequently, he will be accompanied by a "Specialist" for our meeting. I am curious to see how "special" their expertise truly is once I engage with them. Rest assured, I will approach the discussion with tact. Additionally, I enjoy the South African accent of our Account Manager, even if my attention tends to wander at times. G.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, RSLogix 500 is my preferred choice over the 800 series. While the micro800 line has its merits and the CCW software has made significant improvements since its early days, there are still some areas that can be frustrating, such as how timers function and the limitations on bit access in DINT, INT, etc. Despite these challenges, I have found workarounds by creating function blocks to mimic RSLogix's functionality. My Rockwell representative hinted at the possibility of phasing out the 500 line, citing cost and the availability of conversion catalogs and software for transitioning from 500 to 800. I am eagerly anticipating the release of V11 to see what new features it offers.</p>

            <p>Greetings! I am a newcomer to Allen Bradley, starting my journey with the Micro850 controller using CCW V12. Although I have experience in programming with Siemens, Mitsubishi, and Omron, my initial impression of the software was that it appeared overly simplistic and amateurish. Unfortunately, the software encountered issues after Windows security updates, necessitating daily removal of the updates.

As I delved into programming, I found the software to be quite intuitive. The Developer version of CCW provided me with all the necessary tools for my project. With the flexibility to code in Ladder, Function Blocks, and Structured Text, everything fell into place seamlessly. The system has been operational for three months now, and I have not received any complaints from the client.

I am confident in the quality of the product and excited for future developments to come.</p>

            <p>My initial encounter with a Micro 800 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was about five years ago and it was a challenging experience due to the slow programming interface. However, in the past year, I have had the opportunity to work on projects involving this PLC family and have noticed significant improvements in Connected Components Workbench (CCW). I appreciate the easier communication setup via ethernet and the various libraries available from the community.

CCW can be likened to the younger sibling of Studio5000. One drawback for those hesitant to purchase the CCW license is that the free version does not allow for online changes, requiring a machine stoppage for any updates to be made.</p>

            <p>Tim Wilborne noted that he discourages the use of CCW mainly because its software differs greatly from RsLogix 500 or 5000. If someone is familiar with 500, they can quickly adapt to 5000 and vice versa. However, transitioning to a larger PLC family from the 800 series can be challenging when the application outgrows it. With the recent updates in the CCW software, particularly in Version 12, such as the Logix Theme, transitioning between CCW and Studio 5000 has become much smoother and user-friendly.</p>

            <p>Hey Tim, I'm a big fan of your YouTube content, it's incredibly informative. I recently started exploring the micro800 family after working with numerous MicroLogix PLCs. My programming heavily relies on "bit" relays like B3:0/0 for logic steps. I've noticed that your videos don't touch on how the micro800 line handles bit relays in RSLogix 500. I'm hesitant to try converting my RSLogix 500 programs to Micro800, as I anticipate encountering errors due to the abundance of B3:* in my older programs. Are there any workarounds for this issue in the Micro800 system? Any insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Splicer480.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the kind words regarding my videos. One thing that should be mentioned is the method of creating an INT array tag named B3 and manipulating the addresses. However, I strongly urge against this practice. In RsLogix 500, B3:3/6 may have represented the Cycle Running bit, indicated by labeling it as "Cycle Running." In contrast, the Micro800 uses tag-based addresses, allowing us to use a clearer BOOL tag named Cycle_Running instead of B3:3/6. If you prefer to stick with the B3 format for ease of conversion, the address would then be B3[3].6.</p>

            <p>During the process of migrating from an outdated platform to a more advanced one, I ensure to retain the old address information in the description of the new tag. For instance, if the address B3:3/6 in the MicroLogix was labeled as "Cycle_Running", I would create a boolean tag with the same name in the Micro800 PLC. In the tag's description, I would also mention its previous address as "Was B3:3/6". This practice helps in maintaining continuity and clarity during the transition process.</p>

            <p>In the realm of programmable logic controllers, some individuals believe that the Micro800 by Rockwell Automation resembles a product from a lesser-known PLC manufacturer, embellished with inexpensive branding before being marketed as the "Next Gen MicroLogix." However, it is important to note that the Micro800 is a Rockwell Automation creation, from its hardware to its software, which is based on ISaGRAF. Despite criticisms that place the Micro800 at the bottom tier of Rockwell Automation's offerings, it is essential to acknowledge that Rockwell Automation takes full responsibility for both the success and shortcomings of the product. The perception that the Micro800 is a re-branded product is debunked by industry experts who confirm that Rockwell Automation developed the Micro800 and its accompanying software. Its design and functionality cater to the demand for affordable, low-end PLCs rather than aiming to replace the MicroLogix series. This clarifies that the Micro800 was not intended to fill the shoes of the MicroLogix and should not be judged based on that criterion.</p>

As Ken Roach mentioned earlier and Firejo reiterated, these PLCs may give off a cheap, low-end impression because they were originally designed for that market. If they are being positioned as replacements for MicroLogix, it may not align with their intended purpose. There seems to be a disconnect between Rockwell's history of acquiring companies for their technology and branding it as their own, as seen with the new optix panels and software. It will be interesting to see how these products evolve over time and if Rockwell will eventually claim to have developed them from scratch.</p>

As stated by Ken Roach and Firejo in previous discussions, these PLCs may appear to be low-end and affordable because they were designed for that specific market. However, they have proven to be reliable in the Oil & Gas Industry, even in remote locations. Over the past decade, the Micro800 series has been utilized extensively with minimal replacements, mostly due to lightning damage. The developer edition of the software has facilitated programming in Ladder & Structured Text for various applications, including P.I.D. control and Pump Off Control (POC). These PLCs are considered "Smart Edge of Network" devices, connecting to the Scada Server and transmitting a high volume of tags daily using Mqtt Sparkplug B protocol. Despite having experience with other PLC brands like Siemens, Do-More (BRX), and IDEC, the Micro800 series and CCW remain the preferred choice for their reliability and versatility.</p>
