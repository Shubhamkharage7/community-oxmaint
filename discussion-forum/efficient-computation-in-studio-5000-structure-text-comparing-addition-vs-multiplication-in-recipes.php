                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have multiple recipes stored as CASE structures in structured text and I am aiming to maintain a clean and efficient codebase. In terms of computation time and program size, I am comparing two options: y = x * 3 or y = x + x + x. While the processor may handle multiplication as multiple additions, I am curious to hear insights from those with a deeper understanding. To optimize speed, I have already defined common multiples outside of the Case structure for easy reference without the need for repeated computation in each recipe. As I evaluate all recipes for the best fit, my goal is to ensure a swift search process.</p>

            <p>It would be uncommon for the calculation x*n to be slower than adding x multiple times, especially for values of n greater than 2. When searching through a large database of recipes, a CASE statement is likely to be less efficient than a binary search, which in turn may be slower than directly accessing an array (if feasible).</p>

            <p>Performing basic arithmetic calculations usually does not pose any time constraints. However, significant disparities may arise when dealing with exponential operations. For instance, multiplying a number by itself three times (x * x * x) will typically be more efficient than raising it to the power of three (x^3). This performance discrepancy was especially noticeable on older CPUs. Cheers, (8{)} (.) (Yosi)</p>

            <p>For users of Compactlogix 5380, the following example showcases the efficiency of different instructions in terms of time taken. When comparing the operations of adding vs. multiplying, it is found that multiplying REAL values is more efficient, with a time of 0.084 microseconds. On the other hand, when dealing with DINT values, adding proves to be the faster option at 0.013 microseconds. This efficiency comparison holds true until the threshold where y equals x multiplied by 15.

            <p>When searching through a large database of recipes, using a binary search may be faster than a CASE statement, and a direct array lookup may be even quicker. How can you implement a binary search in studio logic? While my recipes do not strictly follow an ascending order, recipe 5 could meet my criteria even if recipe 4 and 6 do not. I may need to check some later recipes, but there will come a point where it is unnecessary to continue searching.</p>

            <p>Sterky inquired about implementing a binary search in Studio Logic. To clarify, executing a binary search in Studio Logic is similar to any other programming language. It appears there may be confusion in the process, as the suggestion of a binary search is possibly due to lack of understanding. How do the case statements, specifically the "best fit" code that is executed for each recipe number, appear? Are they structured similarly, with varying values for different parameters to calculate a fitness metric for each recipe?</p>

            <p>To achieve significant performance improvements, focus on optimizing repetitive operations. Instead of repeatedly doing calculations like x+y+A, x+y+B, x+y+C..., simplify the process by combining x and y into Z and then performing Z+A, Z+B, Z+C... This approach will result in more noticeable gains compared to comparing x**4 with x*x*x*x. It's not worth optimizing basic operations unless you're eliminating or optimizing at least 1000 of them. Eliminating a single frequently called SSV will yield more benefits than optimizing multiple DINT additions.</p>

            <p>It is a common misconception that STX runs at the same speed as ladder programming. However, this is not always the case. Instruction execution times do not take into consideration operand type or fetch and decode times. It is generally more beneficial to prioritize writing code for future maintenance rather than focusing solely on processor speed. This is particularly important for tasks like recipe handling, where minor differences in execution time are insignificant.

For instance, if you were to replace "3 * x" with "2 * x", simply searching and replacing "+ x" with "" would not be effective. Making such changes, like altering from 3 * x to 3.5 * x, can be complex and challenging.</p>

            <p>Drbitboy mentioned that understanding a programming language requires a process, and the suggestion of using binary search may have been made without full knowledge. What does the code for the case statements, specifically the "best fit" code for each recipe number, look like? Are they all similar, but with different values for parameters to determine the best fit for each recipe? This suggestion led me to explore new ideas to enhance the process.

In essence, I am evaluating 2 variables to validate recipes or patterns within certain parameters. Users can then choose the most suitable option for their requirements. It's possible that an early pattern may not fit while a later one in the case structure does. To streamline the process, I plan to divide the Cases into different sets or routines to avoid redundant checks for later recipes.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Sterky mentioned that the suggestion provided some valuable insights and ideas to enhance the current process. The main focus is on evaluating two variables to determine which recipes or patterns align with the maximum parameters. Users are given the flexibility to choose the most suitable option for their requirements. It's possible that certain patterns may not be a good fit initially but could work well at a later stage. To streamline the evaluation process, breaking down the cases into sets or routines could be beneficial.

The question arises whether all cases and sets share the same parameters or subsets of a smaller set. One approach could be to encapsulate all parameters for the cases in an array of User-Defined Types (UDTs) and assess the fitness of the two variables in an Add-On Instruction (AOI) that takes one of those UDTs as an input. This would involve replacing the case statements with a loop over the UDT array.

For instance:

```VAR_INPUT
    var1 : WHATEVER1;
    var2 : WHATEVER2;
END_VAR

VAR
    recipe_array : ARRAY[1..99] of RECIPE_UDT;
    iCase : DINT;
    fit_results_array : ARRAY[1..99] of BOOL;
END_VAR

(* Check which recipes fit the data *)
FOR iCase := 1 to 99 DO
    fit_results_array[iCase] := fit_func(var1, var2, udt_array[iCase]);
END_FOR

(* Present recipes that returned True from the fit function to the user *)
...``` 

By implementing this approach, the process of evaluating recipes becomes more efficient and organized.</p>

            <p>The x*3 operation is likely faster due to x being fetched only once, resulting in multiple instructions operating within a single clock cycle. For example, a multiply and add operation can be completed in just one clock cycle, depending on the CPU. The speed also depends on how the CPU accesses memory. In scenarios like X+X+X, the CPU may only need to fetch X once from memory (slow), and then retrieve it from cache for subsequent operations (fast). It is important to avoid using the X**2 notation instead of X*X to optimize performance.</p>

            <p>drbitboy asked whether all cases, sets, or routines utilize the same set of parameters or subsets of a small set. Can these parameters be contained in an array of User-Defined Types (UDTs) with the variables being evaluated in an Add-On Instruction (AOI) that takes a UDT as an input argument? This would replace case statements with a loop over the UDT array. For instance:

``` VAR_INPUT
var1 : WHATEVER1;
var2 : WHATEVER2;
END_VAR

VAR
recipe_array : ARRAY[1..99] of RECIPE_UDT;
iCase : DINT;
fit_results_array : ARRAY[1..99] of BOOL;

END_VAR

(* Check which recipes fit the data *)
FOR iCase := 1 to 99 DO
fit_results_array[iCase] := fit_func(var1, var2, udt_array[iCase]);
END_FOR

(* Present recipes that returned True from fit function to the user *) ```

Although it would be ideal to simplify the recipes into a single AOI, the variation in math operations within each recipe makes it challenging. To address this, some commonly used math variables are declared outside of the case structure. The math calculations within each case differ, leading to the need for individual handling as shown below:

``` a[0] := var/2;
a[1] := var;
a[2] := var*2;

b[0] := var2/2;
b[1] := var2;
b[2] := var2*2;

case 1:
math and stuff

case 2:
different math and stuff ```

This approach simplifies case creation and enhances readability. While considering breaking out an overall pattern check to a separate case structure, the decision is made to keep it together for easier comprehension and maintenance, prioritizing performance only when necessary in the development phase.</p>
