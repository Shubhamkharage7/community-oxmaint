                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>There is a new Micro 850E model that offers the capability for implicit messaging with a Kinetix 5100 servo and a Powerflex 525 drive. Despite my best efforts, I have been unable to locate any specific guidelines on how to execute this task. This is further compounded by my lack of experience with implicit messaging and Logix 5000 programming. While I possess proficiency in the Micrologix family and RSLogix500, it seems inadequate in this scenario.

The manual for the Kinetix 5100 outlines the setup process in Logix 5000, which I have attempted to follow without success. Rather than employing add-on instructions, the process involves utilizing UDFBs. I have successfully downloaded and configured the UDFBs for the modules, but I have hit a roadblock in terms of connecting them effectively, as there is no accompanying assembly instruction for the UDFB.

If anyone has prior experience in accomplishing this task, I would greatly appreciate any guidance or insights. Thank you, Chuck.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to add PowerFlex 525 drives to your Micro800 PLC program, I recently experimented with this and documented my findings for my team. A crucial tip is to refer to chapter 8 of manual 2080-UM002 for detailed instructions on this process.

Key points to remember: Both Micro850 and Micro870 PLCs support Explicit messaging over ethernet, but only the newer Micro850 (2080-L50E) and Micro870 (2080-L70E) models are capable of Implicit messaging to ethernet devices. This functionality enables seamless communication with PowerFlex 525 drives. Each Micro800 PLC (2080-LX0E) can manage up to 8 PowerFlex525 drives. Ensure that the PLC has the letter "E" in the part number, runs on firmware version 21.011 or later, and uses Connected Components Workbench version 21 or later.

To incorporate PowerFlex 525 drives into your Micro800 PLC program, consult Chapter 8 of 2080-UM002 for step-by-step guidance. Essentially, you must access the Controller in the PLC program, navigate to Ethernet>Modules, and add each drive you wish to control by specifying its IP Address, revision number, voltage, and power rating.

For enhanced convenience, leverage User Defined Function Blocks (UDFB). Download the "PowerFlex52x UDFB Library" from the Product Compatibility Download Center and import it into your PLC program. This will introduce function blocks that facilitate VFD control.

When implementing the UDFB in your ladder logic, ensure that you map the input and output parameters correctly. Remember that sending a stop signal is necessary to halt the motor, as simply removing the start signal allows the motor to continue running.

Further, note that the parameters for the VFDs are not stored in the PLC program but within the drives themselves. You will need to input details such as IP address, acceleration/deceleration rates, speed references, Full Load Amps (FLA), voltage, etc., directly into the drives.</p>

However, the distributor now shows limited stock of L50E-24QBB and L50E-48QWB models, as well as low stock levels for some L70E variants.</p>

This is crucial as there is a forthcoming migration of PLC control at the company Mike works for, transitioning from ML1400's to Micro 850 (2080-L50E).

            <p>Hello Netostp, there have been some updates regarding the encoder models. The 842E has been discontinued and replaced by the 843E. While these two encoders have similarities, there are some crucial differences to take note of.

In terms of integration with a Micro 850E encoder, our AB representative found it challenging initially. However, after some tests, we were able to successfully communicate with it on a trial basis. The AB rep shared sample code with me, although I have yet to use it in a live scenario.

In light of the potential discontinuation of the ML1400, we considered the Micro 850 as a substitute. However, as there is no definitive end date for the ML1400 and the Micro 850 seems to have lighter duty outputs, we have opted to continue using the 1400 for the OEM I am affiliated with.

I recall having to set up a generic ethernet module in CCW to establish communication with the 842E (or 843E) encoder. I also remember the challenges faced when configuring the data tags, which was quite an experience. It goes without saying that working with CCW can be both rewarding and frustrating at times.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In a recent exchange, MikeVT shared insights with Netostp regarding encoder compatibility. MikeVT mentioned that while the 842E has been replaced by the 843E, the two models have some differences. The process of connecting a Micro 850E to an encoder was challenging, even for an AB representative. Despite this, they managed to make it work in a testing environment with sample code provided. 

Considering options for replacing the ML1400, the Micro 850 was a contender until the uncertain discontinuation date of the former. Opting to stick with the 1400 for now due to potential differences in output capabilities, the decision was made to maintain continuity with the OEM. Setting up communication with the 842E (or 843E) in CCW required creating a generic Ethernet module and overcoming data tag challenges.

Netostp expressed interest in acquiring the sample code for testing purposes, with plans to integrate it into a project if successful on the test bench. While appreciating the Micro850's features and reliability in previous projects, Netostp also voiced frustrations with CCW, labeling it as one of the most challenging software encountered. Despite this, the overall positive experience with the Micro850 in factory projects was highlighted.</p>
