            <p>When looking for Genius communications modules for the 90-30, the CMM301 is the original module to consider. While it offers basic functionality, the CMM302 enhanced Genius Communications module and the BEM331 Genius Bus Controller provide additional features. Curious about what Genius devices are connected to your network with the CMM301?</p>

            <p>The device type in question is a controller connected via Serial Bus Address 16, operating at a data rate of 153.6 Kbps Extended. The global data configuration includes Address 16 Length 32, starting at %G00001, and Address 17 Length 32, starting at %G0033. This controller communicates with a field IO VersaMax rack, which includes a backplane GBI001 and VersaMax IC200PWR102J with a series of IO modules. While the BEM module may have been discontinued, in the past, I was advised to use the GCG and PNC modules. I have not yet converted through the gateway, but I assume there are examples available in PDF or online resources. It seems like the preferred route unless CMM002/4 is more applicable and efficient in this case.</p>

            <p>When setting up your network, you have the option to choose between Profinet or Ethernet. To switch to Profinet, you will need to replace your GBI001 network interface units with PNS001 units. You can then opt for either an Rx3i with a built-in Profinet controller or a Profinet controller module in the rack. The PNS001 unit offers the flexibility of a redundant power supply but is slightly wider than the GBI001. Alternatively, if space is limited at the I/O drops, you can go with an EBI001 Ethernet network interface unit. This option allows for the use of Modbus TCP or Ethernet global data as the network protocol. To implement this, you will need a CPU with built-in Ethernet or an Ethernet module in the rack. The EBI001 has the same physical dimensions as the GBI001, making it a convenient choice for your setup.</p>

            <p>The IC695GCG001 is a versatile option that can be integrated into both the Profinet and Genius networks. It may require some reconfiguration of the Genius drops, but it has been a reliable solution for connecting remote panels when running new fiber to Cat 5/6 was not feasible.</p>

            <p>This raises an important question that I will investigate further. The IC200 head unit on the Versamax likely has its own unique program and code embedded within it, which I should try to locate an original copy of. If I were to modify the backplane to EBI001, it would also need to be configured as such on the VersaMax end, rather than being a simple plug-and-play process. While I can upload the program to my laptop using a cable, this may result in losing the comments. If needed, I can refer back to the original documentation in the plant to recomment the rungs, assuming they align with the original documents. My understanding was that the GCG module was designed to accept 2 serial ports and translate them into the Rx3i rack for Genius applications without requiring any changes to the VersaMax location rack. However, I will explore other modules such as EBI001 and those mentioned in the manual to determine the best path for upgrading the main 90-30 rack.</p>

            <p>The GBI001 does not contain any code, only configuration details. The Genius NIU is equipped with discreet I/O blocks in a remote drop, allowing for self-configuration without the need to download a config file. It is important to note that a USB/serial converter is not compatible with downloading a config to a GBI001; a computer with a genuine serial port is required for this task.</p>

            <p>Hey Steve & CMC, I stumbled upon an IC693BEM331 module in the storage area. I need to check if it's functional, but isn't this the same smart controller as the CMM301? It seems that the main difference lies in the output address support, with CMM301 offering 8 addresses while BEM only has 2. However, the CMM301 is only utilizing two output addresses at length 16, whereas the BEM331 allows for global addressing (%G) and is supported by the legacy Rx3i. While I work on planning for a future upgrade, could this module suffice for now and allow me to install the newer Rx3i CPU for ethernet connectivity? I believe it would be a straightforward replacement that would keep operations running smoothly in the short term. My intention is to eventually upgrade for future compatibility, but for now, I focused on upgrading the PSU and CPU to address the lack of ethernet and to establish a safety interlock between the oil system and a nearby mill. I believe this solution will keep things running smoothly in the interim, but I wanted to double-check. Thanks!</p>

            <p>The BEM331 is a powerful Genius Bus Controller, while the CMM301 is a more limited Genius Communications module. Despite their differences, the BEM331 is capable of everything the CMM301 can do. The CMM301 was initially launched with the 90-30, while the BEM331 followed a few years later. During my time at a GE distributor, I inquired about the absence of a Genius Bus controller during the product release. The response revealed that offering a Genius Bus controller for the 90-30 would have resulted in losing a significant portion of the market share to the 90-70.</p>

            <p>Does the GBI001 side need to be aware of the presence of the BEM331 on the opposite side, or does it automatically configure itself? I am unsure if the VersaMax unit on the receiving end recognizes that the previous version was a CMM301 and may result in a configuration error. This thought sparked my curiosity. The history behind this transition is fascinating. Despite the gradual decline in popularity of the 90-70 model, the rx7i also made its debut and I happen to have one here in the plant.</p>

If your company allows, please share your project file so I can replicate your setup using 90-30 and Rx3i hardware for testing. What is your location in Massachusetts?

            <p>Located in Dartmouth, MA, I will inquire in the morning about obtaining a copy of the information. It should not be an issue to acquire it. Feel free to review it if you are interested. During testing, there was an upgrade, but it led to the realization that CMM301 no longer functioned and did not migrate properly. This triggered a series of challenges regarding future upgrade paths in GCG, PNC combo, and other Ethernet-based solutions. Additionally, I am considering upgrading Versamax, however, the facility was originally constructed with everything underground without access to crawlspaces or any existing maps. Trying to fish fiber snake through it proves to be difficult as it hits walls and obstacles. 

I plan to contact a retired individual who was involved in the plant's creation 30 years ago to inquire about any route mapping and methods used for installation. Perhaps using a metal snake would be more effective. It looks like there will be some interesting challenges ahead, as is often the case with these situations. I will keep you updated on progress.</p>
