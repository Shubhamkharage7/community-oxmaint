            <p>When it comes to buttons, there are various types available with unique features. Standard buttons are commonly used for navigation and macros, lacking indicators. On the other hand, multistate or momentary buttons come equipped with indicator features to enhance user experience. Explore the different types of buttons to find the perfect fit for your needs.</p>

            <p>Various objects in your design software have different animation capabilities. For instance, a rectangle object offers a variety of animation options, while a pushbutton may only allow for visibility animation. Interactive elements typically have more limited animation options available.

If you're unsure about how to achieve a specific effect, you can explore the "Indicator" option within the object's properties menu, specifically on the connections tab. This option influences the button's appearance based on the settings in the States tab. It's important to understand when the button displays in State 0 versus State 1 for optimal design results.</p>

            <p>Operaghost explained that different objects have varying animation capabilities. For example, a rectangle can be animated in various ways, while a pushbutton only allows for visibility animation. Objects that are interactive will have limited animation options. The "Indicator" option can be found in an object's properties under the connections tab, affecting the button's appearance based on the States tab. Understanding when the button appears in State 0 versus State 1 is crucial. It's important to note that touch animation/indication is separate from the button's state. If the button cannot activate its target due to logic prerequisites, it will not change state, leading to multiple button presses. Touch animation serves as feedback for users, indicating that they have interacted with the button but are missing a component. Thank you for your response!</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I understand your point, but the discussion veered off course when the term "touch animation" was mentioned. This term can have various interpretations. The touch animation feature in SE applications essentially transforms any object into a clickable button. By using touch animation, I can import a graphic object and apply touch animations to allow users to interact with it, similar to a push button object. It does not necessarily provide feedback indicating that the button has been pressed.

Instead of relying on indicator tags to determine button states, touch animation focuses on the user's actions. Indicator tags control a button's appearance based on the state of the referenced tag rather than whether the button is being pressed or not. Personally, I've never been a fan of indicator tags for the same reason you mentioned. When users press a button, they expect some form of feedback to confirm the action. I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Without any feedback, users may repeatedly press the button without knowing if their action was registered by the system. It's similar to a crosswalk button scenario - some buttons illuminate when pressed, while others do not, leading users to continuously press the button without feedback.

In conclusion, the confusion arose from the term "touch animation" as its meaning was not clear to everyone. It appears that there were different interpretations among us regarding this term.</p>
