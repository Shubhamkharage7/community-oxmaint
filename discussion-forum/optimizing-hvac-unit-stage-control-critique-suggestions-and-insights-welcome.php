                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! I have recently taken charge of a Building Management System that has not been performing up to par since its installation. The system consists of a ControlLogix main unit with wireless communication to a Micro820 unit located on each roof. The Micro820 units are equipped with temperature sensors, which enable them to control fans and activate heating or cooling stages as needed for each unit. 

After successfully establishing communication and initial control functions, my focus has shifted to optimizing the control of multiple cooling or heating stages. The current setup has a five-minute delay between stages, but I am seeking more advanced and efficient control methods. 

As someone with limited experience in HVAC control outside of this particular project, I am curious about how a professional Building Management System handles stage control. Unfortunately, I have not come across typical or exemplary control algorithms in my research online. 

Based on my understanding, I believe that utilizing fewer stages for longer durations is generally more energy-efficient compared to shorter cycles with more stages. This will be my primary objective, unless I discover more effective approaches through further research. 

I have started by monitoring the performance of a non-VFD AC unit and have observed that one cooling stage was adequate until the temperature rose significantly in the afternoon. By activating a second stage, I was able to quickly achieve the desired temperature before the compressors cycled off. 

I have also identified some potential issues with the temperature probes and will address them accordingly. In terms of control logic, I have devised a preliminary plan that involves enabling additional stages after a delay if the temperature deviates from the setpoint beyond the hysteresis range. I am considering implementing a timeout feature to activate another stage if the temperature remains stable but does not reach the cutoff point.

For units equipped with VFDs for heating and/or cooling, I am exploring specific strategies to optimize their performance. It may be beneficial to establish a minimum speed requirement that adjusts according to the number of stages in operation.

At this stage, my focus has been on cooling operations, with plans to address heating functionalities as the colder months approach. I welcome any insights or suggestions from experienced individuals in this field. Thank you for your attention and support.</p>

            <p>In the image Trend4hr.jpg (also known as Trent25hr.jpg but clearer in Trend4hr), at around 15:34, the temperature of the (PV?) surpasses SP+Hysteresis (calculated as 71+1.5=72.5?), with a positive Slope10. It seems that the 20-minute timer has elapsed, resulting in an increase in the number of active stages from 1 to 2. However, by about 15:38, although the temperature has slightly decreased, it remains above SP+Hysteresis, not falling below 71. Surprisingly, the number of active stages drops from 2 to 0. What might have caused this change? Fast forward to around 15:45, the temperature rises above SP+H, with Slope10 staying positive. Despite this, why does it take more than 20 minutes, until at least 16:15, for one stage to restart?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the insightful discussion so far. I am seeking advice on how to effectively determine when to implement additional stages in a system. I acknowledge the need to consult with a service tech or engineer regarding our system, although the timing is uncertain. The Micro820 functions as a thermostat for each unit, regulating temperature by activating cooling or heating at setpoints. It includes power-up and communication loss features tailored to each unit for autonomous operation if the CLX is offline.

I made a mistake in the color coding of the top chart, where red represents room temperature. The trends displayed do not reflect the stage code executions accurately. The temperature was stagnant at 69.5 degrees until I manually triggered the second stage, resulting in cooling at 15:38. The room temperature gradually rose to 72.5 by 16:15, prompting the compressor to restart. The on-off temperature control occurs within the Micro820, with the CLX managing stage control to optimize energy efficiency.

The code is uniform across all units, with variations supported by the Micro820's input parameters. I aim to implement a stage control scheme that can be easily integrated into the unit code. As I expand the system to include additional components like chillers, boilers, and air compressors, I believe there is much to learn and apply to enhance control and efficiency.

In scenarios where certain units struggle to reach setpoints on extreme weather days, adjustments such as activating multiple cooling stages at specific temperatures may be necessary. Air handlers and exhaust fans in manufacturing facilities require precise control for airflow and pressure balance, with temperature regulation being secondary. The control strategy must adapt to the equipment operational needs and maintenance routines.</p>

            <p>As a former HVAC technician turned PLC expert in Kentucky, I have a strategic approach to determine the best solutions for customers. By asking key questions, such as prioritizing between humidity and temperature control, preference for simultaneous heating and cooling, and desire for a multi-stage system, we can pinpoint the most effective fixes. Instead of waiting for setpoint, I prefer cycling compressors to lower tonnage and keeping air flowing over the coil to reduce humidity. If temperature drops too low, I will activate a heater to maintain comfort levels. Let's work together to find the perfect solution for your HVAC needs.</p>

            <p>Hi there! I recently took over a Building Management System that has been underperforming since its installation. The system consists of a ControlLogix main controller with wireless messaging to a Micro820 unit on each roof unit, many of which have a PF525 running the fan. The Micro820 unit features temperature sensors that enable or control the fan, as well as control multiple heating and cooling stages if needed.

After successfully establishing communication and preliminary control, I am now exploring the best approach to control multiple cooling or heating stages. The current system has a five-minute delay between stages, but I am interested in implementing more advanced control strategies. My research indicates that using fewer stages for longer periods may result in greater efficiency compared to shorter cycles with more stages.

I have started by analyzing the performance of a non-VFD AC unit with one cooling stage, which proved adequate until experiencing increased afternoon heat. Adding a second stage quickly reached the desired temperature before the compressors stopped for the next cooling cycle. I observed the temperature trends and identified areas for improvement, such as adjusting the probe configurations. Additionally, I experimented with different methods for calculating room temperature slopes over specific time intervals.

My preliminary idea for stage control involves enabling additional stages after a delay if the temperature deviates from the setpoint and hysteresis range. I am considering implementing a timeout function to activate another stage if the temperature remains within limits but fails to reach the desired threshold.

As I prepare for the upcoming heating season, I am curious about the implications of VFD units on stage control and whether there are specific considerations to keep in mind. Any insights or suggestions on optimizing the system's performance would be greatly appreciated.

In a previous project involving HVAC controls, I integrated a BACnet system using an RTA gateway, which facilitated communication between controls and HMIs. Streamlining the tag matching process and leveraging UDTs helped simplify the interface setup and reduce errors. My experience with burner controls was limited to monitoring status and feedback, with control adjustments to stage burner operations.

If you find value in the approaches I've used with Logix 5000 v. 20.04 or the BACnet manual I mentioned, feel free to reach out for further assistance. Wishing you a successful remainder of the summer season and good luck with your Building Management System endeavors!</p>

            <p>As someone not specializing in HVAC services, I have a question regarding the startup delay in HVAC systems. In my experience with industrial projects involving multiple compressors, pumps, and blowers, a 5-second stage delay was always sufficient for allowing motors to start before starting the next one. Even in projects with larger motors, a 10-second delay was typically used. However, I've noticed that HVAC systems often have a 5-minute startup delay before each air conditioner kicks in on a cycle. This could result in a considerable wait time, potentially causing the building to heat up significantly. I wonder why HVAC systems require such a lengthy delay when even pressurizing the compressor doesn't take nearly as long. This delay could mean the first unit starts immediately while the last one doesn't start until 55 minutes later, which seems inefficient.</p>

            <p>After the compressor reaches operating speed, it takes some time for the refrigerant to begin absorbing the temperature of the conditioned space. This makes it difficult to determine the BTU load in the system. My response considers the various stages within a single HVAC unit. If you are referring to multiple individual units, it is best to start one unit and wait until the current draw stabilizes after a certain amount of time before starting the next unit. This approach ensures efficient operation and optimal performance of the HVAC system.</p>

            <p>According to JeffKiper, the compressor is running, but the refrigerant has not yet begun to absorb the temperature of the conditioned space. This makes it difficult to determine the BTU load in the system. My response is based on the operation of multiple stages in one HVAC unit. If you are referring to multiple individual units, it is best to start one unit and wait for the current draw to stabilize before starting the next unit after a certain time period. This approach is more logical and addresses the issue raised in the previous post about a 5-minute delay on each rooftop unit.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Thank you all for your support. I was being generous in my assessment when I mentioned the original system's poor performance. Two weekends ago, I completely replaced the original vendor code with an improved system that now features a functional HMI, reliable communication between units, and effective unit control - a significant upgrade from before. With our newfound reliable communication capabilities, I am now focusing on implementing smart stage control to optimize energy savings in our system.

I am currently exploring ways to enhance the energy efficiency of our units by adjusting the stage delay settings. Instead of the previous fixed five-minute delay, I have updated the code to allow for adjustable delay times in minutes, with plans to further refine it to seconds in the next update. My goal is to efficiently manage the stages by starting with one and adding more as needed, while also considering triggers to reduce the count based on compressor duty cycle, cycle time, or outside temperature changes.

Most of our units have zero, one, or two stages for both heating and cooling, with a maximum of four stages for either. To accommodate units with four stages, I have ordered Micro850s. Additionally, I am familiar with BACnet and plan to integrate it into our system, particularly for the Trane units connected via ADFWeb Ethernet/IP to BACnet gateways.

As we begin to replace units over the next few years, I anticipate exploring more BACnet possibilities. In the meantime, I will consider using Modbus RTU to the 820 onboard port or a 2080-SERIALISOL as alternatives for data integration. Despite these advancements, humidity control is not currently a priority as our existing units already manage humidity levels effectively.

In conclusion, by continuously improving our system and utilizing advanced technologies such as BACnet, I am confident that we will optimize energy efficiency and overall performance in our HVAC units.</p>

            <p>The "penny drops" as I realize that the .CoolReqOn and .HeatReqOn bits serve as the temperature-driven control signal for the "unit," with your code dictating how many stages to run concurrently. This setup mirrors the concept of "Speed control using level switches" discussed in a previous thread. The level in the tank/sump in the prior discussion corresponds to thermal energy (and thus temperature) within the warehouse in this thread. Similarly, the high level switch signal from before is akin to the .CoolReqOn signal now. The flow into the tank/sump from earlier equates to thermal energy transfer into the warehouse from hotter ambient conditions in this scenario. Controlling the flow out of the tank/sump via pump speed in the previous thread is similar to managing thermal energy transfer out of the warehouse through A/C units here. Adjusting VFD/Pump speed incrementally in the past is like determining the number of stages to run when .CoolReqOn is active now. 

To optimize energy usage, the question arises of whether it is more efficient in the long run to either utilize all stages to cool the warehouse quickly and reset .CoolReqOn promptly, resulting in short cycles with high power usage, or to run the minimum number of stages for a slower cooling process and longer cycle times, leading to lower power consumption. Another aspect to consider is the permissible temperature fluctuation. 

Analogous to optimizing gas mileage with ICE cars, where accelerating hard to reach the target speed proved more fuel-efficient, the same principle may apply here due to the nature of energy consumption in air pumps. This insight could offer a new perspective on energy efficiency in this context.</p>

            <p>After conducting tests on the gas mileage efficiency system, I decided to set up the test unit to alternate between running one stage and two stages every other cycle, with a stage delay of 10 seconds. I am currently logging data from the last 400 cycles in the PLC and will analyze the information next week to determine the system's efficiency.

During a one stage cycle, if the 5min-5min delta (formerly known as Slope10) remains positive for five minutes, the second stage will be activated. This occurred during one cycle this afternoon, as shown in the attached trend. I believe around 18:00 would have been a more optimal time for the second stage to start, and I am exploring different algorithms to trigger the second stage effectively. Additionally, a full day trend of alternating one and two stage cycles is provided for reference.

I have also made sure to fix the pen colors for better visibility.</p>

            <p>While the derivative parameter comparison may be interesting, its practicality in determining when to add a stage is uncertain. A potential alternative approach could involve monitoring if the space temperature fails to meet the [setpoint - deadband] within a specific timeframe after the last stage activation. Additionally, leveraging a PLC to analyze the temporal temperature data using an exponential model post-stabilization could be beneficial. This analysis could help predict whether the system will meet the desired temperature within a certain timeframe and prompt the addition of a stage if necessary. This method aims to optimize system performance effectively.</p>

            <p>Many multi-stage thermostats operate on a time-based system, determining when to activate the next stage after a certain period of no temperature change or a temperature increase. It is uncommon for systems to control based on the rate of temperature change.</p>

            <p>When determining the cost-effectiveness of running multiple stages for a shorter time versus running a single stage for a longer time, it is important to perform a quick "back of the envelope" calculation. The assumptions made in this calculation should be clear, simplistic, and likely accurate. This analysis can help identify the optimal conditions for minimizing costs while maximizing efficiency.</p>

            <p>Optimizing your HVAC system by using fewer stages for longer periods can enhance efficiency and reduce wear and tear on your compressor. Starting with Slope10 or Slope20 as a baseline can be beneficial, with Slope15 being less common due to potential inaccuracies from skipped data points. To take control to the next level, consider calculating the rate of change of the slope (derivative term in PID) for more advanced management. Implementing additional stages based on temperature fluctuations and directional changes is a smart strategy. Adding a timeout feature to activate another stage if the current one struggles to maintain temperature over a set period, like 10 minutes, can also be helpful. For VFD units, ensure proper airflow by setting a minimum speed even with fewer stages in operation. You can also adjust the speed proportionally to the number of active stages.

For effective communication and interoperability in building management systems, the BACnet Building Automation Control Networks standard is a valuable resource. Many BMS systems utilize BACnet for seamless integration. Explore the resources available on the BACnet website, specifically the BACnet Committee page. To further optimize your stage control algorithms, consider reaching out to a local HVAC control contractor for expert assistance. Look for qualified professionals on platforms like Aroundwire, a trusted source for connecting with HVAC service leads.</p>
