            <p>In the paper manufacturing industry, downtime due to equipment failure can be costly, with estimates of a tissue machine being down costing approximately $20,000 per hour. A decade ago, issues with felt roll bearings could lead to catastrophic failures, resulting in downtime of 6-8 hours. However, advancements in technology, such as vibration and temperature monitoring, now allow for early detection of potential issues. In case of a bearing hiccup, a quick shot of grease can often keep the machine running smoothly, minimizing costly downtime.</p>

            <p>Our 1250MWe nuclear power plant, operating at $40 per megawatt-hour, incurs significant financial losses and potential equipment damage during plant trips. The downtime alone costs approximately $3.5 million in lost revenue, not to mention the overtime expenses to expedite getting back online and the impact on public perception. Certain circuits we monitor using infrared technology are susceptible to causing reactor trips due to single electrical failures. The failure of our reactor coolant pump motors results in a plant trip and requires around 11 days of downtime for motor replacement, costing $13 million. Evaluating these examples is straightforward, but assessing potential failures resulting from multiple equipment failures or abnormal plant operations is more complex. Additionally, maintenance issues that do not affect operations but create headaches when they occur are challenging to quantify. Determining the cost-effectiveness of maintenance practices compared to the reliability gained is also a difficult task.</p>

            <p>I managed assets for the US Navy from January 1997 to January 2005, implementing RCM and Maintenance Effectiveness Reviews. Prior to 1997, the annual average of unplanned downtime was 6,577,058 ManHours, which decreased to 3,064,909 ManHours by January 2005. In 1993, I successfully applied a motor-system asset management strategy at a paper mill to reduce unplanned downtime from 26% to less than 6% within two years without increasing the maintenance budget. The maintenance savings were reinvested into the program until it was discontinued by a new owner. Subsequently, unplanned downtime increased back to over 26%. Properly tracking an asset management program can yield significant results.</p>

            <p>Terrence, one of the key challenges in evaluating the impact of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) on overall success is that it is just one piece of the puzzle. RCM does not generate results on its own until it is put into practice, properly measured, and competes with other initiatives. To truly understand its contribution, we must consider the role of other enablers like Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). By adopting a Theory of Constraints mindset, we must evaluate the entire process rather than individual components. A successful company focuses on maximizing results from all initiatives and enhancing every part of the chain to sustain improvement. I have witnessed RCM projects deliver impressive returns ranging from 20:1 to 50:1, but the impact of enablers such as CMMS, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), compliance controls, and quality management cannot be overlooked. While enablers play a crucial role in optimizing results, it is ultimately RCM that drives significant change. Similarly, enablers contribute to the success of Root Cause Analysis (RCA), but they do not solely determine outcomes. They simply enhance the benefits. It is crucial to acknowledge the importance of enablers in achieving success, but success should be viewed holistically rather than focusing solely on individual components. V.Narayan. (Vee)</p>

            <p>Does anyone know the frequency of asset management initiatives resulting in a negative “size of the prize,” where the attempt to enhance practices fails and ends up exceeding the initial investment? This phenomenon can occur for various reasons.</p>

            <p>In my experience, I have conducted a comparative analysis of before and after RCM motor repair/replacement costs for various maintenance organizations across different industries. Despite the diversity in these industries, the outcomes were surprisingly consistent - a reduction of nearly 75% in motor repair expenses. It is interesting to ponder how often attempts to enhance asset management practices end up costing more than the initial investment, resulting in a negative outcome. Over the past four years, I have been involved in the service aspect of RCM and have observed numerous clients who possess advanced tools like vibration analysis, thermography, oil analysis, and CMMS systems. However, many of these tools lay dormant as the trained personnel assigned to operate them are diverted to other duties. While I have not conducted a formal study on this, my estimation is that approximately 50% of the clients I interact with face this issue.</p>

            <p>The asset management program is projected to see a return on investment within approximately three years, similar to other capital projects. It is common for the annual total cost to increase by 10-30%, depending on how resources are allocated to the program. Opting to hire a consultant may lead to higher costs compared to utilizing existing staff through reorganization. However, the savings will eventually be realized after the payback period, so it is important to stick to the allocated budget. This concept is clearly illustrated in John S. Mitchell's book on physical asset management (page 176, Figure 10.1). If tools are not being utilized, consider outsourcing to a vendor if there are no internal capabilities. When managed and directed effectively, there are numerous benefits to be reaped from the program.</p>

            <p>Don, the issue at hand is much graver than you may realize. According to a study conducted in 2003 by Terry O'Hanlon and myself, the actual percentage of the problem is a staggering 93%, not the measly 50% you mentioned. The problem manifests itself in various ways, with one of the most critical aspects being the mismanagement of assets. This typically stems from a lack of action taken after identifying issues, leading to a reliance on reactive maintenance and construction tasks. Over time, the efficacy of the program is called into question. Even if internal capabilities are present, outsourcing to a contractor may only deplete financial resources without yielding significant results. Furthermore, relying on a third-party vendor for data may hinder the ability to analyze and improve maintenance practices effectively. - Howard</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I would like to address several important issues here in order to help broaden the discussion. Firstly, let's consider the potential benefits of good asset management practices, starting with "The Size of the Prize." Many corporations still focus mainly on reducing direct costs, but it is essential to look beyond this narrow view. Implementing reliability measures can lead to significant savings in operational costs, as seen in a recent RCM analysis on an incineration plant in the UK which resulted in £1,000,000 per year in savings. This case study highlights the importance of considering both OPEX and CAPEX improvements when evaluating the success of asset management practices.

In addition to cost savings, there are other areas where asset management practices can provide substantial competitive advantages to organizations. Outsourcing services, for example, can give companies access to highly skilled professionals and modern techniques, leading to reductions in both OPEX and CAPEX. It is important to manage outsourcing arrangements carefully to ensure that the company benefits from these advantages.

I have also written an article discussing the various factors that influence decisions about outsourcing or in-sourcing services, which you can find on Reliabilityweb. Ultimately, the key is to balance the potential cost savings with the long-term benefits of improving operational efficiency and reliability. I hope this perspective adds value to the ongoing discussion!</p>

            <p>When assessing the impact of various enablers like CMMS in a setup, it's essential to consider the holistic view using a Theory of Constraints (TOC) approach. This approach focuses on analyzing the entire chain of operations rather than isolated components. What exactly is the Theory of Constraints Approach, and is there a mathematical formula associated with it?</p>

            <p>The Theory of Constraints (ToC) is a management philosophy introduced by Eliyahu M. Goldratt, a respected figure in the field. While initially focused on the manufacturing sector, ToC has proven to have universal applications in various industries. For a comprehensive understanding of ToC, it is recommended to explore Goldratt's books such as "The Goal" and "It's Not Luck". Additionally, Robert Hansen's book "Overall Equipment Effectiveness" also provides valuable insights into ToC. To learn more about this philosophy and its practical implications, consider delving into the numerous resources available on the subject by Goldratt and other experts.

            <p>The Theory of Constraints is a valuable resource with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, much like any other tool. An example can be found in the reprint of the book "The Goal," ISBN: 0-88427-178-1, which now includes case studies. This book, priced at $24.95USD, offers insight into the challenges faced when developing a process. One case study discusses how the army streamlined maintenance on helicopters by significantly reducing the time it took to rebuild them. However, there may have been missed opportunities by not utilizing a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) approach, as demonstrated by Nancy Reagan's work on army helicopters presented at the IMC conference. It is important to remember that these concepts and methods should be seen as tools in a maintenance/reliability professional's toolbox, to be used when appropriate.</p>
