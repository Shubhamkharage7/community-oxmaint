                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am looking to transfer the program from my CPU317TF-2 DP to my PC by connecting to CP 343-1 Advanced, which has LAN ports while the CPU does not. They are both installed in the same rack, with the CPU in slot 02/03 and the CP in slot 4. Since the CPU does not have LAN connectivity, its IP address cannot be displayed, as it only uses a Profibus cable for communication. Currently, I am encountering an error message stating that "Downloading the configuration is only possible via a CPU...." with only the CP address showing up. I believe it is possible to back up data from the CP in this scenario, as I have done it previously, although I cannot recall the exact steps due to being preoccupied with resolving the issue. I have also attempted using an MPI cable, but I am receiving a different error message stating, "Online: The local MPI address for the programming device/PC is higher than the maximum node address or the wrong transmission rate or wrong interrupt is set." The address is currently set to 0 and the transmission rate is 185kbs. I would appreciate any assistance in resolving these connection problems. Thank you.</p>
