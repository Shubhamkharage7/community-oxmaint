            <p>After serving 4 years in the Navy as an Electronics Technician specializing in submarine weapons systems, my transition to the private sector was a challenging yet rewarding journey. Despite minimal formal training in electronics, my military experience paved the way for various roles in different industries.

Upon entering the private sector, I initially worked as a Controls Technician in the oil field before transitioning to a Maintenance Electrical Technician position in a manufacturing plant. It was during these early stages of my civilian career that I embraced the motto of "fake it til you make it." Despite facing skepticism from more experienced colleagues, I took it upon myself to acquire PLC experience and enhance my skills through self-study and hands-on practice.

Through dedication and perseverance, I expanded my role within the manufacturing plant by taking on special projects to modernize outdated machinery. This eventually led me to establish my own LLC, transitioning to full-time self-employment and achieving financial success beyond my expectations.

Reflecting on my journey, I learned valuable lessons that I believe are crucial for personal and professional growth:
- Take responsibility for your own knowledge and skill development.
- Avoid settling for less than your worth, as initial pay rates can set the tone for your entire career.
- Pursue real raises by being willing to seek opportunities elsewhere.
- Embrace risks as they often lead to greater rewards.
- Prioritize self-employment for a more fulfilling and financially rewarding career path.

My advice to others is to prioritize self-improvement, seek opportunities that value your potential, and embrace challenges outside your comfort zone to avoid stagnation in your career.</p>

            <p>In the late 1980s, I ventured into electrical controls and troubleshooting while working in Alaska. Specializing in relay logic, drives, and motor controls, I honed my skills in the field until 2000. That year, I relocated to Las Vegas and joined the team at the Las Vegas Valley Water District, a prominent non-profit utility responsible for distributing water sourced from Lake Mead across the valley. As an Electrician II, my duties extended beyond motor control troubleshooting, with each team member equipped with a laptop featuring the latest version of Rockwell RS5. Our systems revolved around PLC5/40's and antiquated panelviews, operating on Windows NT. Despite having only completed 2 semesters of electronics and 2 years of electrical engineering at university, I confidently transitioned to a contract role with an integrator/supplier in Michigan around 2015. This opportunity allowed me to independently develop projects and advance to the position of Senior Controls Engineer for various integrators and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Unfortunately, the toxic work environments prevalent among most OEMs led me to exit the controls industry due to what I refer to as the "Jacka** factor." With a journeyman's electrical license acquired in the 1990s, I smoothly transitioned to working as the Lead Electrical Inspector on the Gordie Howe International Bridge construction project in Detroit. The lucrative pay is certainly appealing, but more importantly, the positive work environment surpasses any I have encountered before. I encourage others to persist in their endeavors, drawing upon the advice and guidance of fellow controls professionals. While some may exhibit territorial behavior, remember that everyone starts somewhere.</p>

            <p>As an automation technician, my career journey has taken me through various paths. I initially started college in electronics but was sidelined due to poor grades from excessive partying. I then found myself in an electricity program and worked in construction for a while. When job opportunities were scarce, I returned to school in my late twenties to focus on electronics. My career has predominantly revolved around calibration and validation in the pharmaceutical sector, with a brief stint in a gold mine in Africa where I honed my skills in Schneider software and WW.

After returning to Canada and feeling burnt out from long commutes in Montreal, I made the bold decision to join a nearby calibration company. However, six months later, I received an offer from my current employer to learn various programming software. Despite being hired at 39, I often wonder where I would be if I had started programming in my twenties.

It's fascinating to see younger individuals entering the field with a plethora of opportunities to explore different aspects of the job, from conception to programming. However, some are quick to dismiss learning the fundamentals and solely focus on programming without understanding how things work. Programming may seem straightforward, but the challenge lies in knowing what to program.

I've encountered programmers who struggle with troubleshooting on-site due to incomplete code, emphasizing the importance of asking questions and continuously learning. The silent individuals often hold valuable knowledge, unlike the self-proclaimed experts who may lack actual skills. Choosing your circle wisely applies not just in programming but in every profession.

Remember, lunch breaks are over. Good luck on your journey!</p>

            <p>When your boss is hesitant to invest in software, don't let it hinder your progress. Consider searching on eBay for a "PLC programming laptop." While the availability of these laptops may vary, you might find used computers that still have relevant software installed on them. Keep in mind that you may be paying more for the outdated hardware than it's worth, but the software could be a valuable asset at a fraction of its original cost. It's important to note that using such a method may pose ethical and professional risks, especially when it comes to business operations. However, for those looking to enhance their skills and self-worth, it could be a helpful tool. If you decide to pursue this option, it is recommended to purchase it independently rather than asking your employer to do so.</p>
