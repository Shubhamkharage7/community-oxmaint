            <p>Rolly, as you are asking for feedback, I assume you are open to a realistic evaluation of your website. As a web design professional, I can offer assistance in improving your site. Your website serves as the virtual storefront of your business, so it is crucial to make a good impression. Currently, your site appears homemade, which could negatively impact how your business is perceived. To establish a professional online presence, it is essential to have your website professionally designed and optimized for search engines. The construction methods you have used may hinder your site's visibility and performance. It is important to address issues of compliance and validation, as well as optimize loading times for better user experience. I recommend redesigning your site to meet industry standards and improve search engine rankings for increased visibility and success.</p>

            <p>Dear Rolly, as mentioned earlier, improving your website may require the expertise of professionals. While I can provide some general advice, you may benefit from visiting www.toucher.co.uk for more information. Additionally, www.webmasterworld.com is a fantastic forum where I gained much of my knowledge in this area. I highly recommend joining this community. 
If you are committed to managing your website yourself, be prepared to dedicate weeks to studying this complex subject. However, if your website is a one-time project, it may be wise to seek professional assistance.</p>
