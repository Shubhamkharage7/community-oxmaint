            <p>Looking to access the HMI in Factorytalk Linx? One option is using a USB drive or SD card with the runtime stored in the proper folder structure if you're not connected to a network. However, it's recommended to address the underlying issue for a more sustainable solution in the long run.</p>

            <p>Patrickmoneyy inquired about accessing the HMI in Factorytalk Linx. One alternative for non-networked systems is using a USB drive or SD card with the runtime in the correct folder structure. However, it is advisable to troubleshoot the issue for long-term stability. Despite being on the same subnet, the HMI does not appear in the listing. The other HMIs on the network share the same IP subnet, adding to the confusion of why this particular one remains unseen.</p>

            <p>User chall234 expressed concern about a device not appearing on their network despite being on the same subnet. They noted that other similar devices with the same IP subnet were visible. To troubleshoot the issue, they suggested manually adding the device to an Ethernet driver instead of relying on Eth/IP. This alternative approach may help resolve the visibility problem.</p>

            <p>I'm still uncertain about the ongoing issue; ultimately, I resorted to installing the program through a USB connection. Despite being able to successfully ping the screen, the software fails to display it.</p>

            <p>At times, locating a specific item may require an extended search period, prompting the need to refresh the search. As an alternative solution during the development process, navigate to Factorytalk Linx and manually add it to the Design(local) tree within the comm setup. This method frequently results in the item appearing in the transfer utility tree for easier access.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. Q: Why is the Panelview Plus 7 screen not appearing in the transfer utility after modifying the IP address and updating DNS servers?
    This issue could be due to network configuration problems, firewall settings blocking communication, or incorrect IP address settings. Double-check the network settings and ensure the Panelview Plus 7 is on the same subnet as the computer running the transfer utility.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Are there alternative methods to load the program onto the Panelview Plus 7 screen if it's not appearing in the transfer utility search?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, you can try using a USB flash drive to transfer the program file directly to the Panelview Plus 7. Ensure the program file is in a compatible format and follow the user manual instructions for manual transfer.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How can I troubleshoot the communication issues between the transfer utility and the Panelview Plus 7 screen?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Start by checking the cables, network settings, and firewall configurations to ensure proper communication. You can also try pinging the Panelview Plus 7 from the computer to verify connectivity and troubleshoot any network-related issues.</p>
