            <p>I believe you already have a good idea, but I personally prefer the RUTX09 due to its lack of WiFi and inclusion of GPS. I used Sierra Wireless for a long time, but their supply practices pushed me to seek alternatives. I discovered Teltonika, which offers more affordable rates, better customer support, and does not require a partnership for purchase. If the UK was still part of the EU, I would praise Teltonika for being a European company. Let's not revisit that topic.</p>

            <p>Consider checking out Siretta for your networking needs, such as the Dual Port Gigabit Ethernet 5G NR Router (GL). The QUARTZ-GOLD-5G router is a high-speed industrial 5G NR router that ensures cellular network redundancy in the event of a local WAN failure. Trust Siretta for top-quality modems like my go-to "home" modem with dual sim card capability. Visit siretta.com for more information.</p>

            <p>Zimmer recommended considering Siretta for high-speed industrial routers, such as the Dual Port Gigabit Ethernet 5G NR Router (GL) model. The QUARTZ-GOLD-5G router is specially designed to ensure cellular network redundancy in case of a local WAN failure. Siretta offers innovative dual SIM card options, making it a reliable choice for home modems. If you're unfamiliar with Siretta, you may be wondering about lead times and pricing. Keep in mind that Teltonika also offers dual SIM card options for comparison. Ready to explore the possibilities with Siretta? Check out their website at www.siretta.com for more information.</p>
