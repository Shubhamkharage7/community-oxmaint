            <p>Hello Behrouz, welcome to the forum. It seems like you may be using the wrong GSDML file, as the one you have is intended for an HMS board rather than the Mitsubishi driver. It's possible that the English site is not up to date. I found some different information on the Japanese site and have uploaded the data for your convenience. For Mitsubishi Electric FA, you can download the driver for the inverter FREQROL here.</p>

            <p>Hello Behrouz, it seems like there may be a different interpretation of the problem at hand. The challenge lies in the inability to create a backup of the program using the TIA Portal due to a lack of understanding in configuring and parameterizing the Mitsubishi device. Could you please share the firmware version of the PLC and the TIA Portal version used in the original project development? It is worth exploring if an older version of TIA Portal can successfully upload the project. Additionally, consider putting the PLC in STOP mode during the update to ensure that the S7 processor can focus entirely on transferring the project to the TIA Portal engineering tool. I have not encountered this issue before, so this suggestion is based on my knowledge and experience.</p>

            <p>In response to AlfredoQuintero's inquiry, Behrouz encountered a unique problem involving the backup of a program in the TIA portal. The issue stems from TIA Portal's inability to interpret the configuration and parameterization of the Mitsubishi device. To troubleshoot, it is crucial to identify the PLC firmware version and the TIA version used for the original project development. Consider reverting to an older version of TIA portal to upload the project successfully. Additionally, switching the PLC to STOP mode during the update process may optimize the S7 processor's performance. This unconventional error message, "Could not determine type of module Tyre Rotation (gsdml-v2.25-hms-a8nprt_2p-20130611.xml) offline," was encountered despite efforts to install the recommended gsdml files. If possible, kindly provide the specific file (gsdml-v2.25-hms-a8nprt_2p-20130611.xml) for further troubleshooting. Any assistance in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sending the file. I have conducted a test, but unfortunately, an error still persists. It is possible that the GSD file has been altered by the programmer.

            <p>Hello! Typically, only the manufacturer of the device has the ability to make changes to the GSDML file. This file must be sent to the PROFINET test lab along with the device for testing, which includes verifying that the device behaves as described in the GSDML file. If the machine builder alters the GSDML file, the manufacturer cannot guarantee the product's proper functioning. Have you experienced any issues related to this? It is recommended to set the PLC to stop mode before uploading the project to the TIA portal and to check the PLC's firmware version to ensure it matches the offline version in your TIA Portal project. Incompatibilities may arise if you are using an older version of TIA Portal compared to what the machine builder used. What specific version of TIA Portal are you currently using?</p>

            <p>Hello, I would like to inform you that the GSDML file has been adjusted as I couldn't find the file with that name on the manufacturer's website. To address your queries, I am utilizing TIA Portal version 17, and the project was established in the same version. When importing the project to TIA Portal, I initially choose an Unspecified CPU 1200 in the Add new device section and then click Detect, which accurately recognizes the CPU and its components. The CPU version is also identified correctly. However, when I press Go Online and pick the PLC in the Project tree, the option to upload from the device (software) remains inactive.</p>

            <p>I believe there may be an inconsistency between the PLC part number specified in the project and the actual PLC being used, or it could be that the part number is accurate but the firmware versions do not match. This discrepancy could impact the functionality and performance of the PLC in the system.</p>

<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The error persists because the specific GSD file "gsdml-v2.25-hms-a8nprt_2p-20130611.xml" is needed, and the one downloaded is not the correct version.</p>
