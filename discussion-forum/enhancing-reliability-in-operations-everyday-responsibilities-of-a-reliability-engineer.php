            <p>I understand your sentiments, LKTTU. Our work often combines the roles of Maintenance Engineer and Reliability Engineer, which I find fulfilling. We handle various tasks that involve coordinating maintenance practices with personnel, equipment users, and ensuring data integrity in our CMMS system. Our department also tackles immediate needs as they arise. It can be challenging for a single department to make a significant impact within an organization, especially when some companies attempt to establish an "RCM Department" in this way. Fortunately, our team is skilled in using CMMS systems, database query tools, and Excel, allowing us to address issues effectively. One of our successful initiatives involves analyzing CMMS Problem Codes to identify emerging problem trends. By consulting equipment manufacturers, we have been able to address systemic issues and negotiate solutions, demonstrating tangible results that satisfy management. Currently, our department is focused on projects such as PM Optimization, CMMS Equipment Module Data Integrity, and Equipment Lay-up and Reactivation. These projects involve refining preventive maintenance schedules, ensuring equipment data accuracy, and developing plans for equipment maintenance and activation. We emphasize tracking improvements through charts and spreadsheets to showcase the value of our projects. The distinction between Maintenance Engineering and Reliability Engineering roles may be unclear in the industry, with both terms often used interchangeably. Best of luck. J-</p>

            <p>Thank you both for your valuable input! Vee, I really appreciate your suggestion of setting goals and making plans, but I'm unsure of where to start. I've been out of school for a year and still getting familiar with the industrial environment, so I'm not sure what a realistic goal for reliability would be. Do you have any tips for setting goals in this area? If you have an idea of your current Uptime performance and let's say your OEE is at 55%, consider how increasing it to 65% could impact your company financially. This will give you an understanding of the effort needed to reach that goal. You can also refer to Bob Hanse's book on Overall Equipment Effectiveness for more information on OEE. Additionally, if you know your performance in safety, environmental aspects, or maintenance costs, create improvement plans accordingly. Remember, reliability plays a crucial role in all three areas.

To enhance reliability, there are some steps you can take. Firstly, focus on the basics such as keeping equipment clean, properly lubricated, and well-maintained. This alone can resolve majority of reliability issues. Secondly, address defects systematically through a structured Root Cause Analysis process. Encourage teamwork among operators and maintainers as machinery thrives on proper care. Ensure accurate data is inputted into your CMMS and utilize analytical tools like Pareto analysis to pinpoint key areas for improvement. Provide access to updated drawings and documentation for employees and regularly measure and report progress.

Reliability, like Safety, is a mindset, so it's crucial to prioritize training and awareness among your team. These initial steps are cost-effective and yield quick results. Once you've mastered this stage, consider advanced tools like RCM, RBI, IPF, and FMECA for further improvement. Another important aspect to focus on is Productivity, which hinges on effective Planning, Scheduling, and Work Preparation. Remember, productivity issues often stem from poor management practices. I hope these suggestions provide you with some valuable insight. Best of luck with your endeavors!</p>

One aspect that is often overlooked in these discussions is the implementation of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) studies. Our main consultants are steering us towards this direction to pinpoint equipment vulnerabilities not sufficiently addressed by preventive maintenance (PM), condition-based monitoring (CBM), or predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies using a standard FMEA approach. I am curious to know if this approach is common in other facilities. While it does require a considerable time investment per equipment, the initial findings have been insightful in highlighting unrecognized issues and proposing effective prevention measures. In these sessions, both operators and mechanics actively participate, providing a comprehensive and cross-functional viewpoint. Additionally, we utilize a systematic criticality assessment process to assess the actual risk of failure, aiding in prioritizing which equipment should undergo FMEA analysis. - Ron Pihl, Reliability Manager at LFPPI</p>

            <p>I am intrigued by the extent to which in-house Reliability/Maintenance Engineering Groups incorporate FMEAs into their regular operations. It is crucial to note the emphasis on "internally operating" in this context. Many maintenance professionals, like myself, find ourselves engaging in cross-functional work. It appears that FMEAs are predominantly utilized by external consultants. Personally, I feel the need for more FMEA facilitation training. The industrial sector as a whole appears hesitant to fully embrace comprehensive FMEAs. Instead, decisions are often based on internal experience and recommendations from manufacturers, with maintenance choices made informally. However, there are organizations that refine their initial decisions over time. I am confident that there are sectors where FMEAs are implemented effectively and routinely. I am eager to learn from internal Reliability/Maintenance Engineering personnel about their processes to reaffirm the value of this approach. Recently, I learned about REM (Review of Existing Maintenance) from Vee. This methodology provides a retrospective analysis of maintenance activities, starting from PM/job plans/spare parts and moving towards equipment. As most of us work with equipment that has a history of real failure modes, understanding the operation of the machinery becomes crucial. The success of FMEAs depends on the facilitator's expertise and the skills of the maintenance team present. Given the inherent human variability, I question whether identical FMEAs conducted in the same circumstances could yield consistent results. However, I remain open-minded and optimistic. Jeff.</p>

            <p>One important aspect to consider is the potential loss of craft expertise due to inexperience, a topic that has been widely discussed in both this forum and the magazine. It is crucial to recognize that if craft expertise is compromised by inexperience, the quality of FMEAs conducted will undoubtedly be affected. It may be necessary for the general industry to seek out consultant facilitators and expert craftsmen to ensure optimal FMEA performance in the future. This possibility is definitely worth pondering.</p>

            <p>When determining where to focus your efforts as a reliability engineer, it is important to let the data guide you. By analyzing your production data using a process weibull, you can uncover valuable insights. For example, if 65% of your losses are due to process variation while only 35% are due to special causes like equipment failures or changeovers, then eliminating equipment failures may not be the most effective strategy. In a real-world scenario, a weibull analysis revealed that reducing process variation and changeovers actually led to much more significant gains in profitability than solely focusing on equipment failures. In fact, equipment failures accounted for less than 10% of production losses in one area. This highlights the importance of analyzing data systematically to make informed decisions that drive improvement and increase profits.</p>

            <p>Our PdM department, established approximately two years ago, focuses on vibration analysis and infrared testing currently, with plans to incorporate ultrasound and oil analysis. I handle the infrared work, logging around 70 different readings every week. While most readings show normal conditions, anomalies can indicate potential failures – whether gradual or sudden. We inspect critical equipment monthly and less critical ones quarterly to monitor trends and identify impending failures accurately, avoiding unnecessary downtime and maintaining the trust of our maintenance department. Drawing on historical data, we can differentiate between normal conditions and potential failures, reducing false alarms. In challenging situations, I consult electrical schematics and manufacturers for solutions, yielding positive results. To further expand, we aim to think creatively and consider unconventional inspection targets that may lead to unforeseen downtime. For instance, by inspecting incoming power lines, we discovered a hot connector on a power pole – a potential hazard that could have caused a significant plant shutdown if left unchecked. Embracing a proactive approach with quarterly checks on such unforeseen risks allows us to stay ahead of potential failures and constantly seek new opportunities for improvement beyond our comfort zone.</p>

            <p>The FMEA should be an integral part of a Maintenance Control Plan, especially after conducting a Criticality Analysis related to the business process. Implementing a 10-phase process for Constructing a Maintenance Control Plan can help incorporate FMEA along with practical maintenance and reliability philosophies. This discussion extends beyond RCA, FMEA, and Criticality Analysis, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive process. To effectively support the maintenance control plan, it is crucial to establish and monitor meaningful KPIs for asset and maintenance functions. Proper setup and utilization of the CMMS is essential for supporting these KPIs. Additionally, accuracy in the production reporting system and meaningful feedback from maintenance personnel and equipment operators play a vital role. Conducting equipment and process tolerance checks is necessary for maintenance analysis and asset reliability control. Without addressing these factors, it can be challenging to achieve real control over asset reliability. Remember, maintenance is like a water pipe; any blockages can halt the flow. For further insight, attached are documents outlining the OFMEA process that have been used for previous clients. Implementing FMEA studies can help identify equipment risks that may not have been addressed through traditional maintenance measures, involving operators and mechanics in the process to gain a comprehensive perspective. Utilizing a formal criticality assessment procedure can help prioritize risks before applying FMEA.</p>

            <p>Engaging discussion surrounding the integration of FMEAs into the daily maintenance routine of in house RCM personnel. Despite efforts to implement a sustaining FMEA program, challenges persist in moving beyond the training phase. With maintenance staffing meeting operational needs at 80% wrench time, finding room for improvement remains a priority amidst management's push for efficiency. The virtual FMEA initiative appears to have stalled, raising questions about its future progress. In the midst of agreement troubles on a fan unit, the complexity of FMEAs for equipment like Chromatography skids is highlighted. Is it more feasible to adhere to manufacturer recommendations and leverage internal expertise to streamline maintenance processes, rather than focusing on exhaustive FMEA analysis? The quest for success in the realm of FMEAs continues, particularly in regulated environments. Jeff reflects on the progress achieved in RCM implementation thus far, with aspirations to elevate the program to new heights.</p>

            <p>In considering maintenance strategies, it may be more efficient and cost-effective to follow the manufacturer's recommendations and tailor them to fit the specific needs of your equipment. Manufacturers possess valuable insights on potential failure modes based on their Design FMEAs and limited testing. However, real-world operating conditions can vary significantly from these controlled tests, impacting failure rates. To effectively manage critical equipment, a proactive RCM approach is recommended. While published RCM results may not be readily available, industries with high safety risks have successfully utilized this method to enhance performance and safety measures. In my experience, RCM has proven to be highly effective compared to traditional FMEA methods. It's important to understand the differences between FMEA, FMECA, and RCM to make informed maintenance decisions that ensure optimal equipment performance and longevity.</p>
