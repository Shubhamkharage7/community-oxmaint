                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have just completed troubleshooting a faulty motor and determined that it was malfunctioning through a systematic process. The Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) was unable to ramp up past 3.5hz and was reaching its current limit. I conducted a Megger test from the drive to the motor at 1000v and did not find any ground faults. The motor spins freely, but when I checked the ohms phase to phase, I found readings of 1.3, 1.1, and 0.9 which indicate an imbalance beyond what is considered acceptable. This level of phase imbalance may not necessarily explain the symptoms I observed. Is this significant phase imbalance enough evidence to confirm a faulty motor, or are there better methods to diagnose this issue?</p>

            <p>Although I am adept at utilizing the process of elimination in situations like this, I strongly favor a conclusive test that provides a clear verdict of "yes, that is faulty." Upon further contemplation, I have come to recognize a substantial disparity between phases when analyzed as a percentage.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is important to ensure there is no continuity between phase and ground. Are you conducting the meg test accurately? In some cases, a standard meg test may not detect underlying issues. If you suspect a problem despite passing the meg test, consider conducting a Polarization Index and Dielectric Absorption Ratio test. Before proceeding, could you confirm if the motor is wound in a delta or wye configuration?</p>

            <p>The insulation resistance measured on phase to ground with a hand crank megger was over 2000 Mohm. Typically, I have not needed to conduct the additional two tests, as the motors I encounter often fail due to water damage and do not need further troubleshooting. This particular motor is a wye wound 9 lead 230/480 configuration, wired for 480 volts. The resistance values mentioned earlier are measurements taken from phase to phase through the cable.</p>

            <p>Disconnect all wires from the motor terminals and measure the resistance between terminals 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6. Are the readings similar? Next, measure the resistance between terminals 7 and 8, 7 and 9, and 8 and 9. The resistance values for terminals 7 and 8, 7 and 9, and 8 and 9 should be approximately double the values of terminals 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6.</p>

            <p>When JTCat instructed to unwire each lead of the motor, it motivated me to overcome my laziness and inspect it further on the rooftop. After disconnecting the wires, I discovered that it is wound in a delta configuration. Upon further examination, I noticed a fault where winding 2-5 showed a short to 3-8 resulting in a resistance of 0.7ohm, and 8-5 showed 1.9ohm. These readings should not show any continuity. The unaffected windings displayed a resistance between 0.5 -0.6 ohms. It feels reassuring to have this data on hand despite my rough sketch.</p>

            <p>Connect windings 1, 4, and 9. Connect windings 3, 6, and 8. Connect windings 2, 5, and 7. It is crucial to avoid any connection between the three winding groups in a delta wound motor. As depicted in your diagram, these groupings are not internally linked and should not exhibit any continuity. You seem to have identified the issue - great job!</p>
