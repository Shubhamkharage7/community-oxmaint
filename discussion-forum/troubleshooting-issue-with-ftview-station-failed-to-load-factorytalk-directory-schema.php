                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently facing an issue with my Phoenix Contact Industrial PC running FactoryTalk View ME Station V6.10.00.9(CPR 9 SR 4) at a customer's facility. The terminal was functioning properly at the machine builder's site but now it is unable to open any HMI files. While using FT Diagnostics Viewer, I identified an error message stating "Failed to load FactoryTalk Directory schema for scope "$Local"". This error is causing subsequent issues. I have attempted to create a new runtime but without success.

I have the FactoryTalk View install disks available in the panel. Before resorting to uninstalling and reinstalling the software, I am considering exporting the local directory from a working terminal and importing it to the faulty one. I am not very familiar with FT directories and their functionalities, so any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

It appears that the issue may have occurred during the power down and shipping process, resulting in some corruption. All other HMIs on the machine are functioning correctly. Would transferring the directory from a working terminal be a viable solution? Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Mike</p>

            <p>Hello, I encountered a similar issue with a Windows XP computer that had System Endpoint protection installed. Since it is no longer supported, it was causing issues with FactoryTalk. I uninstalled the program, reset the login, and was able to get everything working properly. - Josh</p>

            <p>This Windows 7 terminal does not seem to have Endpoint Protection installed. The only software present is FactoryTalk and Microsoft SQL Server. Is there a way to confirm the absence of Endpoint protection on this system? The Windows Firewall is disabled, unlike other terminals where it is enabled. I attempted to completely turn off the firewall to address any potential issues. In the latest development, when I accessed the FactoryTalk Administration Console, an error message stated that the security feature could not run due to the FactoryTalk Local Directory not being configured. I then proceeded to run FactoryTalk Directory Configuration and encountered an error message "Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004206A" when trying to configure the local directory. Additionally, the configuration process failed at the step of setting up an administrator account, with the same error message appearing. A screenshot of the Directory Configuration error is provided. Any insights or solutions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike, I noticed the same issue with the System EndPoint icon in the task bar displaying as a green shield divided into quarters. This shouldn't be a problem for you since you're on Windows 7. I was on Windows XP, which is no longer supported. Please try logging back into FactoryTalk. You should find the option in the Rockwell Automation folder. I apologize for not being able to provide more details as I'm currently not at work. Let me know if you need further assistance. - Josh</p>
