                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently started a new job and inherited some tasks from my predecessor. Currently, I am working with a Click PLC C0-11DRE-D, a Cognex DMR-280Q camera, and a 7" HMI system. The system is designed for the operator to input a lot number into the PLC, which then instructs the camera to capture a QR code and send the same number back. Despite seeing the code translation in the camera software, the number is not being communicated to the PLC - only receiving 0's/$$. I tried configuring the camera to use Modbus to align with the click protocol, but the issue persists. While I have experience with ladder logic, cameras are not my forte. Any advice or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated as I am currently facing some difficulties.</p>

            <p>Based on your details, it seems that the Click device functions as the Modbus master in this setup. The suggested sequence of actions should follow as such: 1. The Click device activates a specific bit in the Cognex command word to prompt the scanning of the QR code. 2. The Click device constantly checks the Cognex status word until it confirms that the QR code has been successfully scanned. 3. Once the scanning is complete, the Click device then deactivates the aforementioned bit in the Cognex command word. 4. Following this, the Click device proceeds to request the QR code data from the Cognex. 5. Finally, the Click device retrieves the QR code data from the Cognex. Can you confirm if these steps are being executed accurately as planned?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Keep in mind that the majority of barcode scanners (cameras) typically transmit barcode or QR code data in ASCII format. Therefore, do not anticipate receiving values in decimal form. Consult the camera's manual to identify which Modbus registers store the data for the last scanned code. Extract these registers from the PLC system. Typically, each character (letter/number) is assigned its own byte, so you may need to retrieve multiple registers simultaneously in order to obtain the complete code, depending on its length.</p>
