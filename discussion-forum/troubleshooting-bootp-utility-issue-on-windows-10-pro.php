            <p>It's quite amusing that certain software installations, like an HP printer utility, may sneakily install a BootpServer or a combination of DHCP/Bootp without notifying the user. If you encounter this issue, please report it so that the responsible party can be identified. It's impressive how easily techconnect guides you through stopping the process using the Task Manager: pointing the aim, activating the slide, and pulling the trigger.</p>

            <p>The solutions provided in this technical note may seem unreasonable, but considering it's Rockwell, it's not surprising. One suggestion is to download the latest version of the utility (3.05), which I have attempted multiple times without success. I have discovered that my system has internet connection sharing enabled, and I am unable to disable it without first disabling another process. This temporary fix is far from being a permanent solution. It would be greatly appreciated if Rockwell could address this issue more effectively. Interestingly, none of my network connections have the option "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" checked.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the potential performance of RA's standalone version, I managed to successfully launch it without encountering any port usage errors. I observed a DHCP request coming from a device on my network while testing the software. This raises questions about the compatibility of newer software versions with modern operating systems, as the classic BootP utility surprisingly seems to be functioning well. Thank you for the insightful suggestion, jstolaruk. To download the software, you can visit https://bootp-dhcp-server.software.informer.com/download/.</p>

            <p>phuz mentioned the need for Rockwell to address the issue properly. It is important to note that if port 67 is already in use by a process on a new Windows 10 Pro laptop, it is likely that the process is a Bootp server. One possible solution would be to configure the server to assign a specific IP address to the PLC when it requests one.

IP ports are specific to each host in TCP/IP, with a total of 65536 available ports. If another server process on the laptop has already claimed and is actively using port 67, it is the responsibility of the user to resolve the issue, not Rockwell's.

Bootp is a client-server protocol that utilizes UDP. The PLC acts as the client and sends a broadcast to UDP port 67 with its MAC address to request an IP address. The Windows 10 Pro laptop runs a Bootp server process that listens on port 67, matches MAC addresses to corresponding IP addresses, and assigns them accordingly.

If a server process is already using port 67 on the laptop, any additional process will be unable to bind to that port. This is because the operating system cannot determine which server process should handle incoming requests if multiple processes are bound to the same port.

In essence, a UDP server process like a Bootp server follows these steps: creating a UDP socket, binding it to the server address, waiting for datagram packets from clients, processing them, and sending replies. For more information on UDP server-client implementation, refer to the link provided.</p>

            <p>According to phuz, I have observed that internet connection sharing is currently enabled on my computer system. Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a crucial Windows service that allows one computer with an internet connection to share it with other computers within a local area network (LAN). The computer acting as the gateway device routes all traffic between the LAN computers and the internet. ICS offers Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and network address translation (NAT) services for the LAN computers. This DHCP service might be utilizing port 67, preventing any other Bootp server from binding to the same port. Considering this, is it feasible to temporarily disable ICS to let a separate Bootp server assign an IP address to the PLC, then re-enable ICS after stopping the Bootp server? For more information, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Connection_Sharing</p>

            <p>hardaysknight shared a solution that worked for fixing network sharing issues on Windows 10. By stopping the Host Network Service and Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) in that order, BootP started working properly. However, some may see this as just a temporary fix. It's unclear why this issue is specific to certain laptops, as it seems to be related to Windows 10 running ICS, which can only be disabled by stopping the host network service. If this problem is not common, then I will step back and reconsider.</p>

            <p>Drbitboy explains how Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is a Windows utility that allows one computer with internet access to share its connection with other devices on a local area network (LAN). The computer sharing the connection acts as a gateway, directing all network traffic through it. ICS offers DHCP and NAT services for LAN computers, facilitating network communication. 

Possibly, the DHCP service using port 67 may prevent other Bootp servers from binding to the same port. Temporarily disabling ICS could allow a separate BootP server to assign an IP address to the PLC before restarting ICS. 

Creating a batch script to halt these services, launch BootP software, and then restart the services upon closing BootP is a potential solution. However, as some users suggest, this is a temporary fix. Understanding the root cause of the issue would be beneficial.</p>

            <p>Harddaysknight mentioned that, contrary to other users' opinions, this issue is not just a temporary solution. It is important to understand that in IP networking, only one server can bind to a port at a time. If another server binds to the port first, it is beyond the realm of control for RA. The Bootp tool's help file even acknowledges this issue multiple times. It begs the question - why is the OP's laptop running ICS? Who is it providing connectivity to? One potential solution could be adding the Bootp tool to the services to bind port 67 before ICS initializes. Another option could be using an Open Bootp server with a different IP address for the network card, allowing for the execution of the Bootp protocol without interference from ICS.

            <p>drbitboy pointed out that if another server binds the port first, it's beyond RA's control and not their problem. The issue is even mentioned in the Bootp tool's help file. The concern raised is why OP's laptop is running Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) and which hosts it is providing connectivity for. It's not a matter of blaming RA, as similar issues have been experienced with Keyence BootP software. The focus is on understanding the changes that caused Windows 10 to stop working with BootP software, unless the ICS service has been disabled. There's a desire to learn what caused this sudden change and how to troubleshoot it. While it used to function on the Windows 10 laptop before, it now presents challenges.</p>

            <p>If you're in agreement with me, then you're not disagreeing. Hey @phuz and @hardaysknight, what does your network setup entail? Do you have multiple network interfaces in operation, such as "Corporate Wifi" for internet access and "Plant Ethernet" for hardware communication? I'm struggling with setting up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) ... oh, hold on a second. I realize now that I need to establish two separate networks, with the USB dongle WiFi on a different subnet (192.168.137.0/255.255.255.0) from the wired Ethernet (192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0), and I have a service listening on UDP port 67; see the image below. 

I wonder if Windows 10 Pro automatically activates ICS when it detects multiple network cards. If so, that could potentially lead to issues, although it's not guaranteed to happen. 

In any case, if ICS initiates a DHCP/Bootp server, is there a way to configure it to instruct ICS itself (which I presume runs a Bootp/DHCP server) to assign an IP address to the PLC when the PLC sends a Bootp client request?

            <p>When it comes to networking, do you have multiple network interfaces set up on your computer? For example, do you use "Corporate Wifi" for internet access and "Plant Ethernet" to communicate with plant hardware? I personally use a USB dongle for ethernet (thanks, IT) on my laptop, so it sometimes doesn't show up in the device manager. Despite this issue, I previously had no problem using it on the same laptop. I make sure to disable Wi-Fi and only use the ethernet dongle when using BootP to avoid any confusion with network devices. My suspicion is that there may be a software causing Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) to activate, or possibly a recent Windows update causing issues. Do any of you experience similar networking challenges?</p>

            <p>While I have not used BootP in quite some time, I have found a faster and more efficient method using ControlFlash. By entering the desired IP address and letting it time out before inputting the MAC address, ControlFlash quickly assigns the IP address for your product. This method has proven to be easier and more convenient compared to traditional BootP usage. Additionally, having this tool can be particularly useful for those who work with a lot of devices.

            <p>In a recent investigation, phuz discovered a connection issue related to Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on their system. By terminating specific services, phuz was able to resolve the issue and establish a successful connection. Upon closer examination using netstat, phuz observed that the ICS process was initially not bound to any UDP ports. However, after configuring the network settings, the ICS process connected to various UDP ports on localhost and IP addresses.

Furthermore, when phuz connected to a Wi-Fi access point, the ICS process then bound to additional UDP ports, including port 67. This caused conflict with the Rockwell BootP-DHCP tool, preventing it from running as expected. Even after disconnecting from the Wi-Fi access point, the ICS process continued to listen on port 67, causing further complications.

After restarting the Host Network Service and ICS, a new process ID was assigned, resolving the port conflict issue. Despite adjusting network settings and attempting to use a different subnet, the problem persisted until the ICS process was restarted. This thorough investigation highlights the complexities of network configuration and the interplay between different services and protocols.</p>
