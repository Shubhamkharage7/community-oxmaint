            <p>After spending over 30 minutes on the phone with support, I tried explaining the task I needed assistance with. However, they kept pushing me to use Activation Manager for software activation, as it is the standard procedure for newer software. I even referred to a document (dated 2024) from their website that detailed the exact method with visuals, but the support team still couldn't grasp the process. Frustrated, I had no choice but to end the call.</p>

            <p>LMDAVE shared their frustration with customer support, having spent over thirty minutes on the phone trying to convey their needs. Despite providing a document from the company's website, dated 2024, detailing the necessary steps with visuals, the support team still could not grasp the issue. Frustrated, LMDAVE had to end the call abruptly.

From personal experience, LMDAVE advises using the chat for support inquiries. By providing a direct link to relevant articles and clearly explaining the issue, they have found success in receiving legacy support through chat rather than phone calls. This method has proven to be more efficient and effective in resolving issues.</p>

            <p>Are you able to locate the activation for the master disk and input a reset code into the reset utility? Or has it been completely erased? Can you find the 'EVRSI.SYS' file on the floppy disk, or has it been deleted by a utility program? You may need to disable the "Hide protected operating files" option in the folder view settings.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The floppy disk contains EVMOVE.EXE and Reset.EXE for activation, which was initially stored on the hard drive of a system that crashed. Unfortunately, we did not have a backup image of the drive, so we are reinstalling all software onto the system. I require a master reset to transfer the activation back to the system. Despite multiple attempts to convey this to Rockwell, I eventually had to end the call out of frustration. Their response to the ticket was that resetting the floppy disk was unnecessary as the license had been updated to a 10-digit serial number for installation on a new machine. The call was abruptly disconnected.</p>

            <p>If your PC has crashed and you need to reset your activation, try reaching out to support via chat and provide them with your Product ID and System ID. They should be able to use their tool to generate a number that will restore your Master Disk. In our experience, Rockwell Support has always been reliable and helpful when it comes to activations.</p>

            <p>I highly recommend utilizing the live chat feature for license upgrades from EVRSI to Factory Talk Activations. This convenient tool helped me overcome issues with restoring licenses that were stalled while trying to borrow them from our server due to unreliable internet service.</p>
