                    <p>I have successfully implemented a stack of Moxa E1212 devices for remote RTU panels, including around 50 units. As I prepare for an upcoming project, I am seeking additional features to enhance functionality. Specifically, I am looking for IO LED indication and improved termination options. Currently, with the Moxa devices, the screws are located on the side, making it cumbersome to add or remove units when they are placed side by side. Additionally, I would prefer a device that includes push-in terminals in addition to screw terminals. The ideal device should support either Modbus TCP or Ethernet/IP protocols. I am interested in an all-in-one unit solution, rather than using a bus coupler and individual cards.</p>

            <p>After conducting a thorough test on the Moxa and Emerson RSTI-EP, I ultimately chose the Emerson for its comprehensive features that met all my requirements. I highly recommend it for seamless functionality. Additionally, for all-in-one capabilities, I also rely on the RSTI-OM, which has proven to work exceptionally well.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While the EP may be excessive for some stations that only require a few inputs and outputs, the OM appears satisfactory. However, it seems that I may be overspending on the IP67 rating, considering that the system will be housed in a stainless steel IP66 cabinet. Additionally, the OM only offers transistor outputs when I require the ability to control multiple solenoid valves.</p>

            <p>The MSP mentioned deploying a stack of Moxa E1212 units for remote RTU panels in the past, but is now looking for additional features for an upcoming project. The desired features include IO LED indication and improved termination options, preferably with push-in terminals for easier installation. Additionally, the MSP is seeking a unit that supports Modbus TCP or Ethernet/IP, all-in-one instead of separate components. The Moxa terminals are noted for their easy replacements, with the AD screw terminals being swapped out for Phoenix push-ins. Are you in need of discrete or analog options for your project?</p>

            <p>If you are searching for a remote I/O solution, I highly suggest exploring Wago remote I/O. After using the E1200 series, we made the switch to Wago due to its increased flexibility and cost-effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Varri suggested exploring the Wago remote I/O for its flexibility and cost-effectiveness compared to the E1200 series. For example, a Modbus TCP header costs £264, 8 inputs cost £84, 8 outputs cost £76, totaling £424. In comparison, a Moxa E1212 with the same IO is only £176. The difference of £248 for LEDs and cage clamps may not justify the higher cost.</p>
