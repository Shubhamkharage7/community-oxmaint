            <p>Compliance with preventative maintenance (PM) and instrument calibration schedules is a critical concern in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. Failure to complete a PM or calibration task by the end of the month requires the filing of a report with QA, which can be a challenging process.

            <p>Josh, I understand that Work Orders can be altered or rescheduled, but I always create a one-week schedule that is approved by my supervisor ahead of time. This schedule is utilized for Corrective Maintenance purposes only, and I ensure that maintenance tasks are completed on time. While the start date for tasks may vary, it is crucial that they are finished by the scheduled end date for compliance measurement at the end of the week (Friday). Additionally, I follow a different process for Preventive Maintenance, where tasks are assigned to be completed monthly. The maintenance team may begin tasks at a different time than originally planned, but it is imperative that they are completed by the scheduled finish date. This helps to ensure the smooth execution of maintenance tasks and adherence to the established schedule.</p>

            <p>In order to enhance wrench time and boost labor productivity, it is essential to emphasize the importance of measuring performance metrics. Just like a fire department tracks the number of times firefighters engage in battling fires, businesses should set Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for their employees. KPIs are designed to encourage favorable behaviors and drive results. When given the option between workers who actively tackle issues on the field and those who remain passive in the office, focusing on planning and improvements, the latter option consistently proves to be more favorable for enhancing production performance.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by AromaticsThailand: I now implement a method for ensuring weekly schedule adherence by scheduling 10 jobs, starting 10 jobs, and finishing 8 jobs. This results in a schedule compliance of 100%. Does anyone have a different approach to this? Do you allow operations to use equipment that has had a PM started but not completed? In my company (and likely the entire industry), this would result in facing QA scrutiny even if labeled as 100% compliant. From a QA perspective, can we expect equipment to function properly if a PM is only 60% done? What about 35% done? Or even 10% done? And how crucial is it if the last PM instruction, such as calibrating all instruments on the equipment control panel, is not completed?</p>

            <p>Steve, I would like some clarification on a few points. How can we effectively identify the 50% of non-value adding tasks in our workflow? In what ways can a PMO support lean maintenance practices? Could you explain the concept of business-related KPIs and how they differ from metrics such as Jobs Planned & Scheduled, Jobs Accomplished, PM Schedule Compliance, Jobs with Priority 1 & 2, Rework, and Backlog?

I understand that KPIs are intended to encourage positive behaviors, but in practice, maintenance planning may not always be valued as highly as firefighting maintenance tasks. It would be beneficial to have a leadership mindset that prioritizes planning over reactive maintenance.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the delayed response, Josh. Inquiring about how to pinpoint the 50% of non-value adding tasks and how a PMO can contribute to achieving lean maintenance is a common concern. Various PMO processes exist, but ours stands out as the most effective, naturally.

A PMO functions as a rationalization and evaluation process that begins by assessing the current maintenance program in place, whether provided by a vendor or based on checklists created by on-site personnel. A comprehensive PMO process involves reviewing the maintenance program's past failure history, uncovering hidden failures, and anticipating potential failures. Unlike traditional RCM approaches, many companies opt for the PMO method due to its efficiency, being six times faster while yielding the same maintenance program results.

To identify the 50% of non-value adding tasks, all maintenance activities need to be listed, followed by analyzing the failure modes they aim to prevent or predict. By applying SAE standard task selection criteria, redundancies and instances of over-servicing can be identified and eliminated, streamlining the maintenance program. It is crucial to continuously seek out hidden failures and missed issues and involve operators in the process, as they play a significant role in preventive and predictive maintenance tasks in industrial settings.

Furthermore, ongoing improvement and adjustments are essential to ensure the maintenance program remains current and optimized. For more details on this topic, refer to the attached document "pmo_for_assets_in_use.pdf" for additional insights. Best regards, Steve, from OMCS International.</p>

            <p>What exactly are business-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)? How do they differ from tasks such as planned and scheduled jobs, completed jobs, schedule adherence, high priority jobs, rework, and backlog? I am having difficulty understanding numerous KPIs, including PM Completion and Tool Time. In my opinion, focusing on completing preventive maintenance tasks on time should not be a key indicator for industries, as blindly following maintenance programs can have negative consequences. Instead, PM compliance should be a standard practice managed through exceptions and noncompliance should be addressed promptly. It is essential for companies to have a well-structured Preventive Maintenance Optimization (PMO) program based on reliable decision-making processes like Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM). Emphasizing tool time numbers may lead to a culture where maintenance staff are constantly firefighting instead of proactively preventing equipment failures. Rather than prioritizing wrench time KPIs, it is more valuable to have maintenance teams actively working on preventing breakdowns through proactive measures.

            <p>I recall a time in the aviation industry when the concept of a "backlog" as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) did not exist. Requests for discretionary maintenance work were handled immediately - if it could be completed within current resources, it was approved and planned right away. If not, the originator was promptly notified that the request had not been approved. Approved jobs were scheduled and completed as planned. While there is more to managing a business than just a backlog measure, I believe there are more effective ways to ensure success within budget constraints. It's essential to plan for success and accomplish what is feasible within your means, rather than rely on a backlog and wish for unaffordable dreams. Regards, Steve.</p>

            <p>Steve, I respectfully disagree with your statement that having a backlog is not necessary. It's essential to either have tasks queued for resources or risk having idle employees, which ultimately hinders productivity. While it's true that having a backlog is inevitable, managing it effectively with a well-defined prioritization system is crucial for efficient workflow and resource utilization. I believe a small backlog, typically around 2-3 weeks, along with a solid prioritization strategy, is key to optimizing scheduling and resource allocation. Once the backlog stabilizes at a manageable level, it's more beneficial to shift focus towards tracking compliance rather than continuously monitoring the backlog.</p>

            <p>Hello Vee, I understand that the concept I am presenting may differ from traditional methods. I am not suggesting that there should be no work for your employees whatsoever. In my first job, the business I worked for did not refer to it as a backlog. Instead, we called it Carried Forward Maintenance, which was always part of our forward plan. If a task was not planned for, it was not added to our system. We had a clear understanding of our available resources, anticipated upcoming work, and a team dedicated to handling unexpected issues. We did not measure work in terms of weeks, as our focus was on effectively managing our resources and workload. It is intriguing that many maintenance managers aim to maintain a backlog of 3 to 6 weeks. If the backlog approaches the six-week mark, they hire additional contractors. While this approach may be successful for some, it is not the only method for conducting business. Best regards, Steve</p>

            <p>Steve, can you clarify the definition of carry forward maintenance? In simple terms, it refers to work that is pending and has not been completed for various reasons, such as lack of resources. This backlog of tasks is often managed by prioritizing them based on their urgency and importance. I am a bit confused about your scheduling system. It appears that you are completing tasks based on resource availability rather than their priority. This approach seems unconventional for effective management. Can you provide some insight into your methodology? Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Understanding backlog is crucial in project management. It refers to the work that has been identified but not yet completed. Some view it as a list of tasks without priority or timeline, while others mistakenly see it as a collection of overdue tasks. When addressing backlog, it's important to focus on productivity rather than pointing fingers. For instance, monitoring schedule compliance for planned preventive maintenance (PPM) jobs is essential to avoid equipment breakdowns. However, this should not be a daily cause for concern, but rather an annual report to track progress. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) should be meaningful metrics that employees take pride in, such as accident-free hours. As for performance indicators, "wrench time" - actual hands-on hours spent on tasks - can be a valuable measure of productivity. While high wrench time may indicate peak efficiency during turnarounds, consistently high levels during regular operations could signal underlying issues. It's important to consider workforce well-being when analyzing these metrics, rather than using them to unfairly single out employees or justify terminations.</p>

            <p>Definition of carry forward maintenance involves work that is pending completion, often due to resource constraints, referred to as backlog in many industries. Carrying forward maintenance tasks aims to restore an asset to its original functionality level, without necessarily affecting its operational status. Factors contributing to carry forward maintenance include redundant assets functioning despite failures and deteriorating assets needing minimal maintenance to meet requirements. In cases of asset failure, immediate repair is necessary before the next operation. This discretionary maintenance approach involves assessing risks and response times for effective management.

In aviation, carry forward maintenance required rigorous documentation and approval processes to ensure timely resolution of maintenance issues. Unlike common industry practices of backlog management, aviation maintenance standards emphasize immediate resolution of maintenance tasks to maintain operational efficiency. Incorporating modifications in maintenance requests can lead to budgetary challenges and process inefficiencies, highlighting the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between maintenance and modifications.

Overall, carry forward maintenance is closely linked to budget management and financial control within industries. Despite superficial similarities, the disciplined approach to carry forward maintenance in aviation showcases a stark contrast to conventional backlog management practices. This distinction underscores the critical role of effective maintenance planning and control in ensuring asset reliability and operational performance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the valuable insight, Steve. It is important to recognize that different industries have varying regulations and standards to adhere to. For instance, high-risk sectors like airlines must obtain airworthiness certification, while safety-critical systems are paramount in the offshore oil & gas industry. The pharmaceutical and food processing industries must comply with GMP guidelines. 

Most manufacturing and service sectors operate in medium to low hazard environments. It is crucial to understand that the same principles may not necessarily apply across all industries due to differing risk levels. Managing maintenance processes, such as backlog, plays a crucial role in scheduling maintenance work effectively.

When it comes to backlog management, it is essential to tailor the process to the specific industry requirements. Modifications are inevitable and can result from various factors like RCAs or market changes. Proper budgeting can help streamline non-maintenance elements and ensure a smooth execution of necessary modifications.

Maintenance should be viewed as a process rather than just a department, as it significantly impacts business success. Scheduling maintenance tasks and efficiently managing backlog are key components of this process. Different industries may have varying levels of backlog, with some requiring detailed tracking of work items while others may not find it practical or efficient.</p>

            <p>Vee, you have raised some valid points in our discussion. I understand your perspective. Although the conversation seems to be slowing down, let's continue. As you mentioned, "One size fits all" may not apply in all situations. Customizing the shoe to fit the individual's needs, such as size, fabric, and make, is key. Reliability is vital in maintaining quality standards, as reducing variation is crucial for all businesses. Whether it's producing light globes or ensuring passenger safety, having processes that view modifications as maintenance tasks is essential for achieving process control. Organizations that neglect this aspect may face issues with production costs and overall control. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Vee. - Steve</p>

            <p>I want to clarify that I do not support the statement (which seems to be attributed to me) that having processes treating modifications as maintenance activities will not lead to process control. In my opinion, modifications should not be considered a part of the maintenance process. I believe it is important to distinguish between the process itself and the individuals executing the work. With a modern Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system like SAP, the work can be accurately charged to the appropriate business process, regardless of who is performing it. Traditional departmental budgets may not align with current work practices. Therefore, if maintenance personnel are making modifications, those activities should be assigned to the 'plant change' or 'modifications' process. On the other hand, if operators are conducting tests or lubrication tasks, those should be categorized under the maintenance process. While I agree with your concept of separating modifications from maintenance, I believe that an ERP system provides a simpler and more efficient solution for this issue.</p>

            <p>In cases where a equipment defect does not have a significant impact on plant operations or safety due to redundancy, the industrial plant may choose to defer the rectification job to a later opportunity or shutdown, creating an inactive backlog job. In the aviation industry, how do they prepare maintenance tasks for their workforce? How many planned maintenance hours are ready for execution at any given time? How many maintenance hours are carried forward? If the maintenance department is required to perform modifications but lacks the budget, they can declare no allocated funds. In such cases, the modification requester or plant management may provide the budget through transfers or supplementary budgets, with minor modification costs potentially absorbed by maintenance. The modification process typically requires a specified budget or account code for cost tracking. Maintenance teams can handle minor to medium-sized modifications aimed at enhancing reliability, especially if proposed by internal personnel, to avoid costly external contracting during shutdowns. Maintenance should proceed with modifications only after obtaining approval.</p>

While it may seem cost-effective to delegate all changes to maintenance, the potential risks must be considered - after all, if something goes awry, who will be held accountable? Without a robust system in place, the work environment could become less than desirable.</p>

            <p>Backlog can be categorized into two main types: active and inactive. Active backlog comprises jobs that have been planned and scheduled but not yet completed, making them ready for execution. This follows the front-end loading concept, which aims to enhance productivity and wrenchtime. Any jobs that have not been planned or scheduled are not considered part of the active backlog. The effectiveness of planning and scheduling can be measured through the number of jobs planned and scheduled. On the other hand, inactive backlog consists of jobs that are planned and scheduled for future opportunities or shutdown periods.</p>

            <p>When it comes to managing maintenance backlog, different industries have different approaches based on their specific safety requirements and quality standards. For high hazard industries like airlines, airworthiness certification is crucial. Similarly, the offshore oil & gas industry prioritizes safety-critical systems, while the pharmaceutical and food processing industries adhere to GMP (good manufacturing practice) guidelines.

While the essential principles of maintenance are the same across industries, the application may vary due to different risk levels. It is important to understand that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work, especially when considering modifications and budget constraints. Modifications are inevitable and need to be executed efficiently to meet market demands or process changes.

Maintenance should be viewed as a holistic process rather than just a department, with scheduling playing a critical role in its success. Managing backlog effectively contributes to proper scheduling, but the level of backlog acceptance varies among industries. For instance, in the aviation industry, the backlog may be minimal and tracked using specific tools like CFU. In other industries, such as a Process Plant like an ERF (Energy Recovery Facility) that incinerates Municipal Solid Waste, tracking every maintenance task individually is not practical.

When comparing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and equipment failures across industries, it is essential to identify a benchmark that aligns closely with the specific operations of the ERF Plant. This could involve looking at benchmarks from industries such as Aviation, Oil & Gas, or Power, depending on the similarities in operations and challenges faced. 

Overall, understanding the unique maintenance requirements of each industry and adapting best practices accordingly is key to ensuring business success. Regards, William.</p>
