            <p>I agree with WG that having the option to send private messages (PM's) would be a beneficial feature, especially for more personal or sensitive discussions. I believe that PM's can enhance communication on forums without taking away from the overall sharing experience. It's important to respect individual privacy and allow for discreet conversations, which is why PM's are common on most online boards. I've been encountering that error message for the past two years.</p>

            <p>I strongly believe in the importance of sharing knowledge through forums like this one. It is essential for me to learn from others and contribute to the discussion. However, it can be frustrating when a new thread is derailed by private messages between experts, preventing the conversation from progressing. The role of the moderator is crucial in managing any conflicts that arise, but it is also up to us as users to maintain a respectful tone. Let's keep the discussion engaging and constructive for the benefit of all participants.</p>

            <p>In a recent forum discussion, Batman stated his disagreement regarding private messages between experts hindering public discussions. He highlighted the importance of the forum as a platform to share knowledge and expressed concern about discussions being derailed by private conversations. While acknowledging the role of moderators in controlling aggressive behavior, he emphasized the need for participants to exercise self-control. Batman suggested using private messages for sharing sensitive information, such as contact details or recommendations, that may not be suitable for public posting. He emphasized the importance of respecting privacy and discretion when sharing such information. Ultimately, Batman deferred to the forum moderator, Terry, to make decisions on how best to manage communication within the forum community.</p>

            <p>At times, individuals seek ways to connect outside of public platform for discussions. Presently, users are required to reveal their contact details on the internet to engage in off-topic conversations. While anyone can opt to move a discussion offline, this does not eliminate the need for private messaging (PMs). Having PM capabilities adds a layer of protection for personal information against online threats. I am convinced that endorsing PMs will bring forth more benefits than drawbacks.</p>

            <p>Upon reviewing recent board events, I now understand the rationale for the absence of private messages (PM's). While considering suggesting a group chat similar to Google Huddle, I realized the potential for things to escalate quickly, leading to potential resignations from half the board. Just my two cents. - Aubrey</p>

            <p>Some forum members may choose not to disclose their contact information in order to avoid direct communication. Without private messaging or publicly displaying email addresses, users have more freedom to express their opinions without fear of reprisal. While some may prefer this lack of confrontation, it can also lead to unchecked statements going unchallenged. Personally, I have the email addresses of a few individuals with whom I occasionally clash, but only maintain offline contact with one. Although I have shared my email address multiple times, I have only received negative feedback from one person. It is always uplifting to receive offline support from others, especially when facing criticism for my responses. However, like many users, I often find myself hesitant to ask questions online for fear of ridicule. The absence of private messaging could be hindering the exchange of valuable information and ideas among users on the forum.</p>

            <p>Throughout the years, interactions on forums have varied from extremely helpful and wonderful to downright terrible and even terrifying. There were valid reasons behind our decision not to enable private messaging. Firstly, the fear of salespeople and recruiters overwhelming the platform, requiring constant monitoring to uphold a community focused on exchanging information and experiences (similar to LinkedIN groups). Many members would opt to simply leave rather than report such behavior. Secondly, some users have crossed the line in terms of community standards. Observing the message boards over time is reminiscent of driving in Florida - occasional road rage incidents leading to unpleasant outcomes. While conflicts are to be expected in a community of intelligent, strong-minded individuals, it also contributes to the forum's unique atmosphere. Users have the option to migrate to more social platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, where they can connect with others through friendships or connections. Despite being active on these platforms myself, they lack the distinctive qualities found in these forums. A server migration is on the horizon, alongside a major community upgrade (with the forums remaining mostly unaffected). We are carefully reviewing all previous suggestions to enhance the community based on member feedback. Drawing from past initiatives to foster a more connected community and my involvement in LinkedIn and Facebook groups, I believe there is something truly special about these forums (aside from the members themselves) and the way knowledge and experiences are shared. I suggest proceeding cautiously with any alterations.</p>
