                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings everyone, I am new to this forum. For quite a while now, I have been experiencing difficulties with the 1734-AENT module. It keeps getting stuck in an error state after a certain period of time, similar to the issue discussed in a thread where user Adam 13 mentioned a fault with the Rockwell 1734-AENT Point IO module. One suggested solution was to set the module to auto-negotiation. However, this did not resolve my problem as I am still experiencing intermittent loss of communication, as seen in the attached image. We have two identical machines, but this issue only occurs in one of them. We have tried replacing the module, back plate, communication module, PLC module, cables, etc., but nothing seems to help. Has anyone successfully resolved a similar issue and can provide some guidance?</p>

            <p>Ensure that the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) communicating with the 1734-AENT module is configured for auto-negotiation. If communication issues occur, it may default to half-duplex mode, leading to FCS errors. Consider manually setting the speed and duplex to FULL on both ends to optimize performance. In the past, I experienced network collisions and FCS errors with Powerflex 40P drives using 22-COMM-E cards, causing the 1734-AENT rack to drop out due to misconfiguration of communication settings on each drive.</p>

            <p>In order to prevent communication issues, it is important to ensure that the PLC communicating with the 1734-AENT is set to auto-negotiate. If communication fails, it may default to half-duplex mode, leading to FCS errors. To resolve this issue, try manually configuring both ends to run at full speed and duplex. I encountered network collisions and FCS errors with Powerflex 40P's and 22-COMM-E cards, causing the 1734-AENT rack to drop out due to misconfigurations. While both sides were set to auto-negotiate, the AENT module remained stuck in half-duplex mode. In contrast, another machine consistently ran in full-duplex mode. I will attempt manual configuration to address this issue. Thank you for your guidance.</p>

            <p>dummy_bit recommended ensuring that the PLC communicating with the 1734-AENT module is set to auto-negotiation mode to avoid potential issues. They also highlighted that failing communication may result in half-duplex mode, leading to FCS errors. Consider manually configuring the speed and duplex settings to FULL on both ends to prevent further issues.

Previously, I encountered troubles with Powerflex 40P drives using 22-COMM-E cards, causing network collisions and FCS errors that eventually led to the dropping out of the 1734-AENT rack. Despite setting up full duplex at 100mb/s on both sides, intermittent issues persist. Unsure of the next steps, I am beginning to suspect a possible EMC problem.</p>

            <p>Experiencing Alignment and FCS Errors in CompactLogix - Need Assistance

Hey there, I could use some help with an issue I've been facing recently. My system consists of a CompactLogix communicating with a PLC, also a CompactLogix, and 3 OPC test clients. Lately, I've noticed Alignment and FCS errors in the port diagnostics. Can anyone explain the impact of these errors on my setup? Ken from www.plctalk.net has provided some insight into this issue, suggesting testing the ethernet cable as a potential solution.</p>

            <p>dummy_bit asked for help regarding Alignment and FCS Error issues in a compact logix system. The system is communicating with a PLC and 3 OPC test clients. Recently, there have been observations of Alignment and FCS errors in port diagnostics. What are the implications of these errors on system performance? According to a response on www.plctalk.net, it is suggested to test the ethernet cable for any issues. The user has replaced the ethernet cable and set it to autonegotiate to restore full duplex connectivity. However, the problem persists. Additionally, the "Request Packet Interval" was adjusted from 10 to 20ms due to network delays, but the issue remains unresolved. Despite the absence of alignment or FCS errors, the PLC module is experiencing more frequent problems than before.</p>

            <p>When sharing visuals of safety modules, it can shift the focus away from the actual problem you are experiencing. Can you specify the exact error message you are encountering and its source? There is a knowledgebase article addressing safety card concerns and module issues within specific timeframes (ID: IN34116 | Access Levels: Everyone). You do not require a TechConnect agreement to access the article, just a free account. Furthermore, ownership does not appear to be assigned to your safety modules, so that is something to address.</p>

            <p>dummy_bit inquired about the presence of other devices on the same network, ensuring they are all configured to auto-negotiate and verifying the absence of duplicate IP addresses. There are distinct IP addresses assigned to different machines - one with 192.168.2.xxx and the other with 192.168.3.xxx, each corresponding to an Ethernet PLC module. jstolaruk sought clarification on the version of Studio being used. MikeyN advised against posting images of safety modules and instead urged the discussion of actual errors and their origins. A knowledgebase article (ID: IN34116) addresses safety card issues for modules built within specific date ranges, which can be accessed without a TechConnect contract by creating a free account. Furthermore, the issue highlighted in the image is attributed to the lack of ownership for the safety module, as it was previously replaced. Appreciation was expressed for the provided link for further investigation.</p>

I believe @jstolaruk's recommendation applies to modules that can be updated, such as PLCs and communication modules. In my personal opinion, it is best to only upgrade PLC firmware if essential or for compatibility with other plant systems. However, it may be beneficial to consider updating as a diagnostic measure if possible.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the TechNote, components within the specified date range should be replaced if necessary. While my experience with Point IO is limited, it is unclear if their firmware can be updated. I believe @jstolaruk's advice pertains to updating modules that are capable of being updated, such as PLC and communication modules. From my perspective, upgrading the PLC firmware should only be done if essential or to align with other plant systems. However, it may be beneficial to attempt it as a diagnostic measure if feasible. 

To clarify, my suggestion was to update the EN2T firmware rather than the safety modules. I also recommend updating the Studio software and installing the latest patches. In the event of issues with the safety modules, I have encountered RA taking prompt action, particularly in instances like a faulty batch of 1734 safety output modules, where replacements were prioritized.</p>

            <p>joseph_e2 mentioned in the TechNote that modules within a specified date range may need replacement. While my experience working with Point IO is limited, I am unsure if their firmware can be updated. It is suggested by@jstolaruk to consider updating modules that can be updated, such as PLC and communication modules. Personally, I recommend upgrading the PLC firmware only if necessary or for system harmonization purposes. However, it may be beneficial to try updating firmware as a diagnostic step.

In response to the confusion, jstolaruk clarified that the suggestion was to update the EN2T firmware, not the safety modules. Additionally, updating the Studio software and running the latest patch updates is recommended. In cases of safety module issues, Rockwell Automation takes it seriously and will prioritize swapping out faulty modules promptly.

It is advised to order a new module to resolve the issue and to address the overheating concern, especially if thermal imaging shows a temperature of nearly 70C while other components remain cool. This raises questions about the hardware design of the AB inputs.</p>

            <p>The impact of poor hardware design can affect all modules across the board. I recently discovered that the underperformance of my output modules was due to the use of subpar components. I have a hunch that this may also be the case in this scenario.</p>

            <p>After experiencing a similar issue this year, we spent months trying to resolve it. Issues with safety modules are common in networks and can lead to communication problems. Despite replacing multiple modules, backplanes, and switches, we were unable to fix the problem, much like your situation. The most recent fix involved removing and reinstalling a NIC card on a connected PC, which has now prevented faults for several weeks. Previously, we were encountering issues about 6 times a day. It is important to note that while the physical safety output module may be the first to show signs of trouble, the root cause may lie elsewhere in the network. It is crucial to regularly check all network components for the latest drivers and updates. Best of luck with your troubleshooting efforts!</p>

            <p>Level mentioned dealing with a recurring issue that persisted for months with their safety modules. These modules are known to be sensitive and can often be the source of communication problems within a network. Despite replacing multiple modules, back planes, and switches, the problem persisted. Eventually, the solution came in the form of uninstalling and reinstalling a NIC card on a connected PC, which alleviated the issue for several weeks. It's important to note that the root cause of the issue may not necessarily lie within the physical safety output module itself, but it is often the first component to be affected. Make sure to thoroughly inspect your network and ensure all components are equipped with the latest drivers. Good luck troubleshooting! Just to clarify, when referring to a NIC card, are you referring to a ControlLogix card or an Ethernet module?</p>

            <p>DominikPi inquired about a NIC card in relation to ControlLogix or aent ethernet modules. However, the NIC card being discussed is actually on a PC connected to a vision system within the machine network, not a PLC. When attempting to retrieve data from the PC using a python script to communicate with the PLC, a communication fault occurred on the safety input module. This issue was found to be recurring.</p>

            <p>TheWaterboy suggested troubleshooting network switch issues by manually setting the ports to full duplex mode, especially on older switches. If that doesn't work, make sure the aent module is directly connected to the PLC ethernet card. This can help resolve any connectivity issues.</p>
