            <p>Hello Josh, it seems you overlooked a few key points such as the history of asset operation data collection and analysis for a reliable approach, as well as the preparation of reliability and management policies for implementation. I hope this information proves valuable to you.</p>

            <p>To enhance equipment reliability and performance, it is essential to review the history of equipment failures and pinpoint the main failure modes for critical machinery. By implementing maintenance plans based on Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles, tailored to address these identified failure modes, you can significantly improve equipment uptime and longevity. It is crucial to develop detailed maintenance procedures that are fit for purpose and ensure they are entered into the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for timely implementation.

Furthermore, it is important to establish both leading and lagging maintenance and Reliability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor and analyze the performance of your maintenance program. By tracking these KPIs over time, you can identify areas for improvement and take proactive measures to prevent failures. This may include conducting regular walk down checks, following best practices for lubrication, and implementing visual signs for easy equipment monitoring and maintenance.</p>
