                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Experiencing a recurrent issue with an Ingersoll-Rand 12x28 LPA pump can be frustrating. The pump features shaft seals that are designed to protect from external substances but not necessarily to contain oil. Despite having an oiler for easy maintenance and an oil level indication on the outside of the pump, oil leakage has become a mystery over the past few weeks.

After diligent monitoring and replacing a defective oiler, the pump continued to leak oil heavily, especially from the inboard seal. This is perplexing since typically, if there is excess oil, leakage would occur at the outboard seal - which is not the case here. Various theories have been pondered, including the mechanism of oil transfer along the shaft and the functioning of the oiler.

Considering installing external oil level indicators may be a helpful solution for future maintenance. However, the current focus remains on understanding and resolving the ongoing oil leakage issue. Any insights or assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Sekou, it can be a challenging task to identify oil leaks, especially when they are not obvious. If the oiler level is correct, there may be a fault in the oiler assembly that is allowing air to enter the bottle, causing oil to leak out. Incorrectly fitted bearing end covers could also be a factor, either allowing oil to escape or disrupting the internal flow of oil back to the reservoir, leading to leaks from the seals. Additionally, a loose or cross-threaded bearing housing drain plug could be another source of oil leakage. While easy solutions may be visible in the form of large oil drops, this case may require some experimentation. Best of luck, Joe Mc Cormack.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Joe. I am currently investigating an additional potential source of the issue. The RA end cover, also known as the wet end, is constructed with 3 (possibly 4) holes positioned around the shaft seal diameter 'x'. These holes are utilized during the assembly of the pump to facilitate bearing adjustments. Following assembly, these holes should be sealed with screws. We will verify that all screws are present and properly installed to ensure proper functioning.</p>

            <p>One possible reason for a leak at the inboard versus outboard seals could be a discrepancy in the seal's fit on the shaft. This could be due to a score mark on the shaft where the seal attaches, or the shaft being slightly smaller or the seal slightly larger on one side. However, proper maintenance of the oil level should prevent this issue. Several factors can affect the level setting, with ventilation being a key consideration. It is crucial to ensure that the bearing reservoir and oiler cup are adequately vented. Check for any obstructions in the vent holes, such as paint or debris. Additionally, make sure the oil piping is correctly positioned in line with the bearing rotation to avoid creating a low-pressure area that could lead to oil leakage. Setting the pump's level accurately is essential, as relying solely on external markings on the casing can result in problems. If possible, use a boroscope to observe the bearing's operation and determine the precise oil height needed for optimal recirculation. In some cases, the difference between too little and the correct oil level can be as small as 3/32 of an inch. It is crucial to set the oiler ball at the exact point to prevent overfilling and leakage. Consider installing a level glass for better monitoring. For detailed information on setting up these units correctly, refer to Trico's website or page 10 for insights on overfilling issues. Airflow around the vent is also crucial to prevent problems.

            <p>Thank you, Rich, for confirming the source of the leak. It appears to be coming from one of the plug screws mentioned in my earlier post, which are concealed by the flinger during pump assembly. This information is valuable and much appreciated. Thanks once again for sharing the link.</p>
