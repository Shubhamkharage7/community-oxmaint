                    <p>I am seeking feedback from individuals about their preferred hardware manufacturers. Our aerospace manufacturing facility primarily uses ERP / MRP software and Excel, with minimal SCADA implementation. We have plans to collect data at various stages of the manufacturing and assembly process. Although we have Windows terminals at each workstation, I am looking for ways to communicate with operators beyond email. I started by testing a Delta Industrial Automation PLC & HMI, but I am facing challenges with integrating barcode readers and transmitting data to SQL databases. While I am open to other options besides Delta products, I have found their free software to be less efficient. Any recommendations with detailed explanations would be highly valued. The first project involves using PLC / HMI for the following steps:Enter Employee IDScan 2D barcode on partSubmit the dataTimestamp will be automatically recorded in the backgroundData will be stored in SQL database.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum community! When seeking equipment recommendations, expect diverse opinions based on individuals' experiences with different languages and controllers. What systems are you familiar with? 

Personally, I initially support the Red Lion suggestion but would like to gather more information and provide additional insights. In a recent project, I utilized a barcode reader with an Allen-Bradley PanelView Plus. Encountering some challenges, I researched using Red Lion and found solutions to my issues related to barcode input methods.

If you have a 2D symbol reader with a USB connection, please specify the exact model and type of symbols being read. How do employees input their Employee Number - via keyboard, touchscreen, 2D reader for ID badges, or RF proximity reader for ID cards? 

Where is your SQL server located? Is it a Microsoft SQL Server or different? Would you prefer a dedicated HMI touchscreen or a browser-based HMI for convenience on Windows workstations? Rediscover Red Lion's features, including its SQL Sync and SQL Query capabilities. 

Ensure your automation system has an accurate Time value, potentially by querying pool.ntp.org. Consider how you plan to use the data logged about the parts and anticipate adding automation to other processes and equipment.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PLCTalk forum community! When seeking equipment recommendations, it's common to receive suggestions based on personal preferences and experience. What programming languages and controllers are you familiar with? 

I recently used a barcode reader with an Allen-Bradley PanelView Plus and encountered some challenges. Researching Red Lion's solutions, I found that they addressed the issues I faced. 

If you have a 2-D symbol reader, please specify the model and type of symbols you're reading. Are employees entering their IDs manually or is there a need for scanning or swiping ID cards? 

Regarding your SQL server, is it a Microsoft SQL Server, and do you prefer a dedicated HMI touchscreen or browser-based interface? Consider Red Lion's different HMI options. 

Red Lion offers SQL Sync for uploading log files to an SQL server and SQL Query for extracting data. If you require UPDATE or INSERT commands, explore other options. 

How do you ensure accurate time in your automation system? Consider querying time from pool.ntp.org or using another source. 

What are your plans for the logged data? Are you looking to implement automation in other processes and equipment in the future?

            <p>Thank you for providing context and detailed information! Your requirements may not align with traditional PLCs, even those with IIOT capabilities. CNCs handle CNC tasks, while building management requires a different skill set and hardware. SPC, PFMEA, and OEE are specialized industries of their own.

When considering your desired production data output, it's important to explore the capabilities of CNC tools and ERP systems. If faced with similar requirements, I would deviate from my usual Rockwell Kinetix/Logix platform and consider alternatives like Red Lion DataStations.

Have you set up a Turnkey Linux instance with the LAMP stack? Are you comfortable with Javascript, Python, and Linux installation scripts? Do you have Raspberry Pi devices or familiarity with CoDeSys and Wago controllers?

When it comes to SCADA systems, Inductive Automation Ignition is often recommended for its power and reliability in client/server setups. It's Java-based, browser-launched, and seamlessly integrates with SQL databases. Ignition's Maker Edition or full version can be installed on a Linux box for experimentation.

Consider exploring Node-Red for low-code IIOT functions without the need for a PLC. Additionally, browse Wago's controller catalog for options like the CC100 and PFC200 family, known for reliable distributed I/O solutions. Wago offers embedded Linux boxes running CoDeSys PLC runtimes and Node-Red for flexibility in connecting and monitoring devices like pumps, compressors, and power monitors.</p>

            <p>Hello Ken,

I apologize for the delay in response as I've been occupied with relocating and setting up machines at our facility. After reviewing your suggestions, I am particularly interested in the Node-Red option, especially since I am a beginner in this field. Additionally, I have a scheduled meeting with Wago tomorrow to discuss their IIoT box.

I am now facing some fundamental questions regarding PLC/HMI design. Despite my efforts to research online, I find myself stuck in a loop and have decided to seek guidance from professionals.

One specific aspect I am grappling with is the setup on the HMI screen where the operator scans their ID badge and Serial # (2d code), followed by a "Submit" button. The two user input boxes are connected to different Tags on the PLC.

My query is: Does the "Submit" button, through ladder logic, write the inputted data to the Tags and then clear the input boxes? I want to ensure I am on the right path and not veering off course.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>16-09-2024</span></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The function of a Numeric Input may vary slightly across HMI platforms, but generally, it saves the inputted value to the associated PLC tag/variable/register upon pressing the "enter" key on a virtual or physical keyboard. The PLC tag that the "Submit" button updates can be programmed to process the values stored in the ID_Badge or Symbol_Code variables. Your HMI system might allow you to disable the Submit button until values are entered into the ID Badge and Symbol Code fields, or verify that the correct format is used for each entry. Alternatively, the PLC logic could perform validation checks and trigger a warning if an entry is missing or invalid.</p>

            <p>Given that this is a fresh endeavor, my initial suggestion would be to utilize a cloud-based database such as Microsoft Azure. While I have not personally tested it, Butsia Connect claims to effectively link nearly any PLC to this database, seemingly by employing an intermediary computer.</p>

            <p>I want to express my gratitude for assisting me in grasping PLCs, even if it has been a challenging journey. I am seeking feedback on my progress and guidance on rectifying any errors. I have included screenshots to provide context.

On the HMI, the user is prompted to input their Employee Number or scan their badge, with some issues arising when two barcode fields are present. Following this, the user scans the "Actuator Serial Number" and clicks "Submit" to transmit data to a database (either cloud-based or local) before the screen is cleared.

In terms of the PLC, I am looking for assistance in understanding where I may have gone off track. Please disregard the Test, switch1, and lamp1 Tags. I am at a loss regarding what to include in the ladder logic.</p>
