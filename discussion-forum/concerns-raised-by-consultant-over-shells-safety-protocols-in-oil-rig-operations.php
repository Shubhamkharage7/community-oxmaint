            <p>For those interested, there is another article available on the website of the water regulator for England and Wales at http://www.ofwat.gov.uk/aptrix/ofwat/publish.nsf/Content/pn0906. This article discusses how the regulator has involved the serious fraud office to investigate regulatory data at Severn Trent, a water company in the UK. Regulated companies must regularly justify their billing amounts through a pricing review process, which includes operational and capital spending. Regulatory data mainly consists of asset data such as numbers, types, condition, and forecasted failure rates of assets. Failure to maintain updated CMMS data can result in heavy penalties, a situation unique to certain industries. In a similar case, OFWAT fined Thames Water £140,000,000 for not meeting leakage reduction targets set during a pricing review. This highlights the importance of schedule compliance, which varies among industries. Ultimately, maintenance practices may differ based on nationalities, but the fundamental principles remain the same, with approaches tailored to specific circumstances.</p>
