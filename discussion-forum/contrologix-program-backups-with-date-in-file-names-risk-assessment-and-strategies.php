                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Some of our team members have a habit of including the date in the file name when saving program backups. These backups are stored in a separate folder and are done on a weekly basis. They typically use the "Save As" function to save the program as programfilename 5_14_24 in the backup folder, and then again as programfilename 5_14_24 in the regular file folder. Despite the date being shown in the file details, we are concerned about any potential negative implications of this practice. While I personally do not prefer this approach, it seems challenging to change this behavior among our team members. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When it comes to managing different versions of your files, proper version control is essential for ensuring smooth and efficient workflow. While ad hoc version control may not be the most organized approach, it is still better than having no version control system in place. 

Are you able to access previous backups to retrieve older versions of your programs, or does each week's backup simply overwrite the previous one? If the former is true, consider configuring your backup system to exclude files with ad hoc names to prevent clutter and confusion. On the other hand, if your backups do not retain older versions, your colleagues' "bad" habits could ultimately prove to be a lifesaver.

To tackle the issue of clutter, you may want to consider creating a designated sub-directory like ".\zzOld\" to store older versions of your programs, such as program 20240514, ensuring that they remain easily accessible when needed. This simple organizational change can make a significant difference in how you manage and access your files in the long run.</p>

            <p>Agreeing with the past struggles of working with the 8.3 filename format, many people used to alleviate this issue by creating a dedicated folder with the project name and saving each file with a date included in some way. This method helped organize and track files more effectively.</p>

            <p>Having dates and numbers in file names doesn't present any technical challenges; it's simply a matter of personal preference. I empathize with the struggle of ensuring everyone is on the same page. Our file naming convention follows the format suggested by @drbitboy: PXXXX_YYMMDD_JefLeb.

            <p>I recall a problem from years ago where renaming the processor file caused issues with saving and downloading. It often resulted in errors while saving programs, with messages about the file not being found. I will try to find a image of the issue.

            <p>There seems to be a recurring issue with saving and downloading files in our program due to possible network drive instability. While it's common for problems to arise when working with a program on a network drive, the current issue is particularly troublesome. After encountering faults with saving the program, an error message stating the file cannot be found is displayed. This may be related to the processor file name causing issues when being changed. Unfortunately, the files left on the network drive end up being 0kb, rendering the latest copies corrupt. We'll investigate further to see if we can find a solution for this persistent issue.</p>

            <p>dmroeder pointed out that this issue occurs frequently, potentially due to accessing a file over a network drive with an unstable network connection. While program malfunctions on network drives are not uncommon, this specific problem appears to be unique. One major consequence of this issue is that the file left on the network drive becomes corrupted, with a size of 0kb. This issue was initially raised, and despite extensive testing with Controllogix, it could not be replicated consistently. It appears to be related to the addition of the .tmp extension to the saved file.</p>

            <p>For nearly three decades, I have been diligently backing up programs by adding the alteration name when making changes, confirming the alterations, and utilizing my standard naming convention. Taking these steps may seem insignificant, but in reality, they can save you significant time and effort in the future. By ensuring that you have a backup to revert to in case something goes wrong, you can quickly resolve any issues that may arise. This proactive approach can be especially beneficial when unexpected errors occur. In the long run, investing the time to properly back up programs, like I have done for years, can truly pay off.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your input. I was wondering if it's beneficial to regularly update the file name when only saving the program without any modifications. I acknowledge that the term "backup" could be misleading as no changes are being made, just ensuring an up-to-date copy in case of emergencies. The issues we encountered while saving the file with dates included prompted my curiosity.</p>

            <p>I, like the original poster (OP), prioritize keeping file names unchanged for better organization. When creating backups, I transfer files to a new folder named with the backup date. This strategy helps me to easily spot when each backup was created while maintaining the original file names.</p>
