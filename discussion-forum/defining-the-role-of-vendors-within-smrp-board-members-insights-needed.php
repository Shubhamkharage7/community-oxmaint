            <p>A vendor should possess the capability to offer essential resources and services such as manpower, materials, equipment, and technical expertise needed for successful project completion. Additionally, they should provide supervision, coordination, and quality assurance plans to ensure the work is done effectively. It is essential for vendors to offer cost-effective solutions that are sustainable in the long run, benefiting both the vendor and the client financially. Any deviations from standard norms must be clearly outlined in the contract document beforehand for transparency. This approach ensures a smooth and successful collaboration between all parties involved.</p>

            <p>I am contemplating a different approach in determining roles based on the actual tasks being performed rather than focusing solely on the company's vendor status. Patrick, your role involves a significant amount of maintenance service, similar to when you were working at a mill. This places you in the category of a practitioner. If your role involved new business development, then you would be classified as a vendor. Do you see where I am coming from? By defining roles based on selling, we risk misclassifying individuals who do not engage in selling activities. This distinction is important for participation in SMRP, as it is a community created "for practitioners by practitioners." Terry O</p>

            <p>Terrence, is there a divide between practitioners and vendors in the field of Reliability and Predictive Maintenance? I offer my services to clients in need of PdM and actively implement Reliability practices in my consultations. According to Josh's definition, I may be considered a vendor, but my focus remains on practicing and providing valuable advice to clients. To address this issue, we could take inspiration from the Vibration Institute's approach. They categorize certification levels and maintain a list of Certified Consultants, allowing for clear distinction between practitioners and consultants offering marketable services. Excluding vendors from the realm of reliability professionals would be detrimental to the industry as a whole. In the past, Reliability Magazine forums often included "Vendor Disclaimers" to ensure transparency when vendors discussed their products or competitor issues. It's important to recognize that vendors can provide valuable insights that help individuals make informed decisions.</p>

            <p>Quote: Patrick, you now perform just as much maintenance service as you did while you were at a mill. Your role as a practitioner is evident in your job as a Dictionary Vendor. A vendor, by definition, is someone who sells goods or services. While a significant part of my job entails practicing, I also focus on selling my company's services and maintaining our reputation. Our success as practitioners relies on our ability to deliver on our contracts; otherwise, they won't be renewed. As the face of the company to our clients, I understand the importance of selling and showcasing our services. In the corporate world, a vendor is essential for providing services or products that complement others. Simply put, vendors cannot thrive in isolation. Therefore, it's crucial to focus on selling and promoting our offerings. Merely discussing by the water cooler or engaging in hobbies like rewinding motors won't generate income. A true vendor, whether an individual or a company, is characterized by their role in the corporate structure and their ability to provide value. They also know the importance of networking and relationship-building over lunch. This mindset is essential for success in the industry.

At SMRP, participation is key, as it is a community "for practitioners by practitioners." The term practitioner refers to someone actively engaged in their field. However, in today's diverse landscape, anyone can claim to be a practitioner in various areas. When looking at the SMRP board members, many hold high corporate positions, and some may even be considered vendors. This diversity can lead to complex discussions and viewpoints. Considering a 'code of conduct' for vendors and all individuals involved in selling services is essential. Excluding vendors from the conversation seems counterintuitive, especially since many vendors have practical experience in the field.</p>

            <p>Terry, I find it interesting that there is a distinction being made between a practitioner and a vendor. As an RCM practitioner and consulting engineer, I am both someone who provides services and implements them in practical situations. As a marketer, you are also directly involved and have a stake in the services being offered - does this exclude you from being considered a practitioner? I believe that the definition of a practitioner should focus on the actual provision of advanced services rather than just the execution. It would be concerning to be excluded from a professional organization based on this distinction. The criteria for defining a practitioner should be based on the work done and level of experience rather than job title. Just my two cents.

            <p>In the realm of online discussion forums, it is important to clarify whether you are a vender selling a product or simply a practitioner sharing knowledge. It is possible to be both on platforms like this, but transparency about any biases towards a product is crucial for meaningful discussions. Concealing your bias in an attempt to appear unbiased can be misleading and hinder authentic interactions.</p>

            <p>Chris is correct that having more information allows for better decision-making. However, the quality of the information is crucial. It is important to consider the reliability of the source, whether it is supported by scientific data or the credibility of the provider. Reliable information should be utilized, while unreliable information should be disregarded. When the information falls in the middle, one should use their best judgment and assess the outcomes. Ultimately, the key is to prioritize quality information for making informed decisions.</p>

            <p>When determining how to define a vendor, the scope may vary depending on the context and perspective - whether you're a buyer, seller, or a service provider. It may be beneficial to consider defining a "Practitioner" instead of a "Vendor" to gain a clearer understanding. However, it is essential to not limit the definition of a "Practitioner" too narrowly, as it may discourage qualified individuals from participating. On the other hand, defining it too broadly may not meet the standards of experts in the field. 

Considering the involvement of sales in the discussion, it is important to acknowledge the knowledge and expertise required in selling maintenance and reliability services. Sales professionals often transition from being practitioners themselves, showcasing their understanding of the subject matter. Even college professors and instructors play a vital role in educating and shaping future practitioners in maintenance and reliability. 

In conclusion, the criteria for identifying a practitioner in maintenance and reliability may encompass a diverse range of roles and backgrounds. It is crucial to consider the valuable contributions of all individuals involved in the field, whether they are in sales, education, or service provision.</p>
