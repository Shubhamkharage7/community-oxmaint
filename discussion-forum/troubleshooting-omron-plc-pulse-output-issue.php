                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently working on a project involving linear motion control using a ballscrew shaft driven by a stepper motor and controlled by a PLC system. The PLC model I am using is the Omron CP1E-N30DT-A. The stepper motor in use is a Nema 34. The main objective is to enable the stepper motor to move in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. However, I am encountering an issue where the stepper motor driver does not seem to be receiving any pulses from the PLC. I have utilized the PLS2 instruction to generate and control the pulses. Despite observing the indicator lights on in outputs 100.00 and 100.02, which I have designated for this purpose, the driver does not register any pulse signals. I have connected the PUL- to 100.00 and DIR- to 100.02, with PUL+ and DIR+ linked to the positive 24V through a 2k resistor. The common terminals for 100.00, 100.01, and 100.02 are all connected to the negative 24V. Any advice or assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Have you verified that your PWM driver module sources at 24v? Many of the ones I've come across typically operate at 5v and sink.</p>

            <p>I believe the PLC output is sinking, which is why the common ground is negative. This can have an impact on the overall circuit performance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Certainly! The power is supplied to a pin on the drive module, with the PLC's common being at 0V. Depending on the type of drive you're using, there may be issues to watch out for. For example, I encountered a problem with a PWM drive module where the input is 5V sinking, while the PLC is normally 24V sinking. It sometimes worked and sometimes didn't, as the sinking outputs were only pulling down to around 2.4V instead of 0V. A typical connection involves the inputs being pulled down. It's also advisable to reduce the PWM to a slow, long pulse to accurately measure the pulse coming out of the PLC.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Upon reviewing the PLC's pulse output, I noticed that the voltage remains steady at 24V when the output is off. However, when the output pulse is activated, the voltage drops to 12V and remains steady. Ideally, the voltage should fluctuate between 24V and close to 0V. This issue seems to be the underlying cause of the problem, but I am unsure of how to resolve it.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>PLC transistor outputs require a higher load capacity for optimal performance. To address this issue, a resistor was added to the power supply of the PWM card (for the inputs) and another resistor was connected from the PLC output to ground to provide additional load. This modification successfully resolved the issue, as PWM card inputs have high impedance and minimal current draw.</p>
