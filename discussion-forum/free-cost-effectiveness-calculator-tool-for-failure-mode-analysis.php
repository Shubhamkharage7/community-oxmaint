                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Dear All, I am sharing a useful freeware tool that I developed some time ago. I often distribute this tool, along with various other models and resources, to participants in different courses and RCM Analysts. This tool is an Access database designed to quickly calculate cost effectiveness for specific failure modes that have financial implications. Please note that it is meant for analyzing failure modes that can be managed through on-condition tasks, preventive repairs, or preventive restorations, and not for detective tasks which require a separate analysis. I am currently working on a second version of this tool with detailed instructions and added functionality. Your feedback on this tool is valuable and can be sent to darylm@strategic-advantages.com. Feel free to share this tool with anyone who may benefit from it. Kind regards, Attachment(s) CostEff_Calculator.zip 582 KB Version 1</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, I will be sharing the finalized model here in about a week. The model was generated by the RCM Analyst software system and was not originally intended for standalone use. The updated system now includes various new features, including customizable costing criteria, a comprehensive reporting module, export capabilities, and more. Ultimately, it is designed to support your daily work tasks. Personally, I have found it to be helpful. (I also enjoy Access programming as a hobby!) Could you please clarify what you meant by "No databases for selection by users"? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Would it be feasible to incorporate databases containing information on equipment classifications and types along with their associated failure modes, effects, consequences, criticality, detectability, and risk levels?</p>

            <p>Josh, I'm not involved in this particular project for two specific reasons. Firstly, it is focused on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, rather than being a Reliability Centered Maintenance database with a range of failure modes pre-defined. Users are required to input these failure modes themselves. Secondly, a key aspect of this project, as well as RCM in general, is the consideration of operating context. This means that the costs, effects, and overall consequences are influenced by how the equipment is utilized (such as asset configuration and type). Essentially, it would be my interpretation of how to effectively manage assets, although it may not align perfectly with your specific needs. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
