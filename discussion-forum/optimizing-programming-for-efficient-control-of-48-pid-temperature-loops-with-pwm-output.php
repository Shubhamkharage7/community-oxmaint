            <p>To optimize the loop update time for a cyclic interrupt, divide it by 48 (e.g. 4.8s รท 48 = 100ms). Use this result as the cycle time for the interrupt. Each time the interrupt is executed, increment an integer by 1, ranging from 0 to 48. When the integer reaches 48, reset it to 0. Based on the integer value, trigger one of the 48 PIDs. Utilizing an array or FBs for this process would be beneficial, although its feasibility is uncertain. This approach aligns with the suggestions from @tarik1978.</p>

            <p>Operating with a 4.8-second cycle time utilizing pulse width modulation (PWM), each subsequent loop begins 100 milliseconds after the previous one. This may result in the cycle ON times of early controllers overlapping with the cycle OFF times of later controllers. Unfortunately, it is difficult to prevent heating from a cold start as all controllers will initially demand 100% output until the temperature reaches the proportional band.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey questioned the idea of limiting the number of heaters that can be operational at the same time with PID control. However, in industries like hydraulics, it is common practice to stagger the operation of similar machines to avoid peak fluid demand. Similarly, in the case of heaters, running all 48 at once can be managed by slightly syncing the PID controllers. By offsetting each PID by 20 ms, all 48 heaters can still be operated within 1 second. The decision on how close the heaters need to run at maximum capacity depends on the system's time constant, which the OP has not provided. If the time constant is long, the PIDs can be spread out over a longer duration. Additionally, a feedforward strategy based on the product flow can be implemented to adjust the heating requirements based on the number of widgets running through the ovens, as widgets absorb energy and increase the heating demand.</p>

            <p>danw noted that by utilizing a 4.8 second cycle time with a proportional running time (PWM) where each subsequent loop is offset by 100mS, there may be overlap between the ON times of early controllers and the OFF times of later controllers. It is challenging to limit heating during a cold start, as all controllers will initially call for 100% output until the temperature reaches the proportional band. It is advisable to proceed with the program implementation, taking into consideration the slow cold start required for the oven's operation.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, tarik1978 shared a manual from Siemens on multi-zone temperature control. The document can be found at the following link: [link]. The manual discusses controlling multiple zones that interact with each other. The main focus is on program efficiency to ensure optimal performance and power efficiency. To prevent power peaks, it is important to avoid all 500kw heaters starting and stopping simultaneously. Ideally, there should be minimal fluctuations by initiating the PID loops outputs in a systematic sequence. Your feedback and suggestions are appreciated.</p>

            <p>I have extensive experience working with glass tempering ovens, which are equipped with heaters arranged in banks. Each bank operates as its own zone, with varying sizes and numbers of elements. When the oven is started from a cold state, it only activates the zones with 4 elements until it reaches a specific temperature. Then, it will activate the larger elements once the oven is ready for processing. This staggered firing sequence is common in solder reflow ovens as well. If each heater is wired to its own output, you can easily control and activate groups of heaters at a time. You have the option to set specific zones in separate subroutines or utilize a drum instruction to cycle through the heaters. This flexibility allows for efficient and precise control over the heating process.</p>

            <p>ExsacInfinityBeforeZeroLLC shared their expertise in operating glass tempering ovens with individual heaters linked in banks. Each bank functions as a separate zone, varying in size and number of elements. The ovens are programmed to initially activate the smaller element zones when starting from a cold state, gradually activating the larger elements as the temperature rises for processing. This staggered firing process is similar to the operation of solder reflow ovens. By wiring each heater to its own output, users can selectively fire groups of heaters at a time. This allows for customization by setting specific zones in separate subroutines or using a drum instruction to step through the heaters. In the case of the commenter's old tempering glass oven, all heaters must work together simultaneously and gradually increase in temperature together.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey raised an interesting question about the impact of thermal load on oven temperature. Is there any research available on how the temperature in the oven is affected by the rate at which widgets are entering? It's worth exploring whether an increase in widget flow causes a temperature drop, in which case a feed forward system could help adjust for the heat absorption by widgets. Perhaps conducting our own study would shed light on this issue and potentially speed up troubleshooting. However, it's important to proceed with caution as conducting experiments in a tempering glass oven poses safety risks.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, if the resulting PID corresponds to a PWM output based on time, there may not be a need to stagger the PIDs separately. Unlike hydraulics, ovens do not require fast-acting adjustments, so phasing the individual PIDs 48 times may not offer significant benefits. Instead, consider grouping the resultant PWM signals and phasing them collectively. Any minimal lag introduced would likely have a negligible impact on oven temperature control.</p>
