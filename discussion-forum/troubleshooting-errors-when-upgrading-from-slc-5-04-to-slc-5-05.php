            <p>While older segments of the system can still utilize DH+ technology, it is important to consider the purpose of DH+ in the SLC aside from connecting to the panel mate. Why is there a shift towards using ethernet instead? Panelviews with DH+ capability are available for purchase, but the preference for ethernet connectivity is evident. In lieu of using an external gateway from Prosoft, it is recommended to explore other options if possible.</p>

            <p>To optimize your process, consider integrating a ControlLogix gateway with a 1756-DHRIO card and a 1756 Ethernet card in a 4-slot rack configuration along with a power supply. This setup may require rerouting your DH+ messages for seamless communication and enhanced operational efficiency.</p>

            <p>Explore the logic behind DH+ messages and connect to the DH+ network to determine the station numbers of devices. RSLinx Classic can easily scan the network to display the identities of controllers and devices connected. If MSG instructions consistently fail with .ER bits, they may be directed towards devices that have been removed and are no longer relevant. Consider investing in an EtherNet/IP to DH+ converter (QTS, marketed as AN-X by Prosoft) for Ethernet to DH+ routing capabilities, though it comes at a significant cost.</p>

            <p>If you are constantly experiencing errors with the MSG instructions showing .ER bits, it is possible that they are directed to devices that have been unplugged and are no longer relevant. As Ken Roach pointed out, reconnect the 5/04 and check if the errors persist. If they do, they may not be affecting the system. This issue is not uncommon.

Consider using a DH+ to Ethernet gateway, such as the AN-X2-AB-DHRIO, to convert Ethernet IP to Allen Bradley Data Highway Plus DH +. Additionally, think about the benefits of upgrading to a 5/05 from a 5/04, especially if you are only doing so to install a PanelView. Instead, you could use a PV/HMI with DH+ compatibility. EZ Automation offers a DH+ HMI that can be easily programmed and connected to the network. Be sure to check the node addresses to avoid conflicts.

Check out EZTouch HMI/Operator Interface products, which range from 4 inches to 15 inches and offer universal connectivity to all PLCs. Visit www.ezautomation.net for more information on these affordable touch screen interfaces.</p>

            <p>geniusintraining mentioned checking if errors persist by reconnecting the 5/04. If errors persist, they may not affect functionality. A DH+ to Ethernet gateway, the AN-X2-AB-DHRIO, is available for converting Ethernet IP to Allen Bradley Data Highway Plus DH+. Consider using a PanelView or a DH+ HMI from EZ Automation for programming and easy integration into the network. Upgrading to a 5/05 PLC may not offer significant advantages if DH+ communication is necessary. Explore EZTouch HMI products for a cost-effective touch screen solution compatible with all PLCs. The decision to upgrade stems from the non-repairable Panelmate HMI and an opportunity for beginners to learn PLC. The intention behind considering the DH+ to Ethernet conversion is familiarity with ROCKWELL Factory Talk HMI and the need to communicate with another PLC. Thank you for the valuable insights and assistance. We appreciate the support and look forward to expanding our knowledge in this community.</p>

            <p>If there is only one other PLC, can you also replace it with a 5/05? PLC-5 models also have Ethernet versions available. When searching on eBay for these products, keep in mind that the DH+ option module for older PV+ models (Pre PV+6) is no longer in production. Consider looking into ProSoft gateways, although they may come at a higher cost.

Aside from the EZ Automation HMI suggested by @geniusintraining, explore Uticor as well. Both companies appear to be part of AVG or associated with AVG. I have experience working with both companies in the past and, while not my top choice, they are reliable options. I recently replaced an old PanelMate and outdated TCP panels with an EZ Automation HMI and Uticor products. Uticor is one of the few non-AB HMIs that offer a DH+ option.</p>
