                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello there, as a enthusiast in the field of PLC programming, I am interested in creating my own PLC training setup. I plan to incorporate various field devices not only to enhance my programming skills but also to gain expertise in configuring different IO devices typically used in industrial settings. I am curious if anyone has embarked on a similar journey and if they have suggestions for additional devices that could benefit my practice sessions. My goal is to master the communication between different devices through various protocols. So far, I have acquired a CompactLogix, Network switch, Panelview HMI, Point IO, IO-link master, IO-link sensors, Proxy’s, Photoeyes, Pneumatic cylinders, and solenoids. Any recommendations for more devices or applications to expand my knowledge in this area would be highly valued.</p>

            <p>Looking for budget-friendly resources for PLC training courses? Visit Corsairhmi.com for a downloadable PLC class program. Learn about relay socket basing for classroom applications on page 287. This is essential for understanding discrete I/O components. Many universities and labs utilize this resource successfully. Prioritize mastering Modbus communication protocols, both serial and Ethernet. Don't be intimidated by it, as it's not as complex as some suggest. Once you're comfortable with Modbus, explore AB DF1 protocols. While Allen Bradley offers quality products, remember there are other options to consider. Diversify your skills to stand out in the field. Avoid common programming mistakes seen in AB CPUs by non-programmers. Familiarize yourself with SQL and consider learning about BACnet and UDP. Get started by downloading Wireshark to better understand network communication. Feel free to reach out to me for guidance on learning protocol functionalities.</p>
