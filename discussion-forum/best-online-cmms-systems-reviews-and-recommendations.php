            <p>There are numerous factors to consider when choosing an online CMMS system. Many people wonder about the amount of available options in the market and which companies offer them. It seems like knowledge about these systems is lacking within our community, or there is a limited selection to choose from.

            <p>I apologize for misunderstanding your initial post. I now see that you are specifically interested in online services. In the UK, there is a significant opportunity for companies to offer this type of service. Being the first to establish a reliable system could lead to success. If I were younger, I would definitely pursue this myself. I have experience with companies in the US and Canada, such as Directline, Equipsoft's MX4 (now part of Eagle CMMS), and Agility in the UK. Your choice between a product installed on your servers or an ASP (Application Service Provider) solution, also known as SaaS (Software as a Service), depends on your preference. I previously wrote a report on this topic for Plant and Works Engineering magazine, which I have attached for your reference. Although it is slightly outdated, much of the information is still relevant. Enjoy reading! Attached is the document titled "CMMS_Software_for_Hire.pdf."</p>
