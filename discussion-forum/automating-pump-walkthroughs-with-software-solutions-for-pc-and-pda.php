                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! We have started conducting "Pumps Walkthroughs" every 2 weeks. During these walkthroughs, we inspect for noises, mechanical looseness, temperature in pump and motor bearings using a laser thermometer, leaks in seals, and oil levels. Currently, we record our findings in an Excel file and by hand in the plant. If any issues are found, we create work orders to address them. However, I am eager to automate this process. Is there software available to manage these rounds, where we can upload the route to a PDA for data collection and then input the information into the program? I am particularly interested in a software solution for both PC and PDA that can not only manage these walkthroughs but also oil and grease rounds. Please share if you have any information on this. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello, while I am not aware of specific software that performs these tasks, I can suggest a simple solution. Many vibration portables or data collectors include a feature known as "manual entry," allowing you to input the parameters mentioned and send the data to the software for reporting. While I cannot confirm all the parameters you require, it is worth trying this option out. By utilizing vibration portables, you can establish a routine check process.</p>

            <p>At dmcaz4, we have implemented a highly effective strategy called LLFC (Look, Listen, Feel, Correct) in our PdM program, which has delivered impressive results. This approach involves utilizing the SKF Microlog vibration data collector and SKF machine Analyst software recommended by Mr. Walid. By leveraging the vibration-related database and assistance provided by the software, our vibration analysts are able to communicate seamlessly with the data collector to upload and download data through serial/USB connections. The open architecture of the software allows for the flexible development of asset hierarchies tailored to our specific needs. 

At each plant, we have established equipment hierarchies with LLFC measurement points linked to various rotating equipment, including ultrasound levels, pump suction and discharge pressures, pump flow rates, bearing temperatures, seal cooler inlet and outlet temperatures, and current readings from local ammeters, among others. Our vibration data collection personnel use handheld instruments like thermometers to manually enter LLFC data into the pre-configured measurement points in the data collector, enabling us to track changes, identify trends, and generate work orders based on deviations. 

After a year-long survey, we have established alarm and danger thresholds for all measurement points, enabling us to prioritize exception-focused vibration and LLFC surveys. These surveys are conducted alternately (for example, if a vibration survey is conducted every 30 days, an LLFC survey is conducted every 15 days) to assess the equipment's condition in terms of bearing temperatures, pressures, and more. Remarkably, our surveys have detected numerous incipient failures, with LLFC surveys proving more effective than vibration surveys in some cases. By customizing and optimizing your data collector, you can unlock even greater benefits from this approach.</p>

            <p>Hey Dave! I recently came across the TANGO software, which is a powerful tool for managing walkthroughs, lubrication, repairs, and other maintenance tasks. Are you aware of its compatibility with SAP and PI (Plant Information) systems? If it can integrate with these systems, it would be ideal for our preventive-predictive maintenance needs. If you have knowledge of any similar software, please feel free to share. Thank you for your help!

            <p>If you're in need of a solution for data collection on your PDA, check out the software available at www.desmaint.com. While I don't personally use or sell this product, it seems highly capable and could be a great fit for you. Another cost-effective option is creating your own forms using software from http://www.ddhsoftware.com/ for just $40 USD. These forms can easily integrate with popular databases like MS Excel and MS Access, making data collection a breeze. Consider using a standard or rugged PDA or Smart Phone for optimal results.
