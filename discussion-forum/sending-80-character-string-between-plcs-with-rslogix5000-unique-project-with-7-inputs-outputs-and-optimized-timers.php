                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently received a unique request from a customer regarding a project. I have successfully written and tested the logic using just 7 outputs and inputs on one PLC. I am sharing the details along with screenshots in case anyone is interested in trying it out as a new project. While working on this, I made sure to thoroughly test the logic to ensure it runs smoothly without any issues. Despite the project not being a major undertaking for me, I am hesitant to continue working with this particular customer due to their preference for cost-saving measures. I have put the processor through rigorous testing and it has proven to work effectively. The timers have been optimized to prevent overloading an I/O card, with the maximum update time being around 25 seconds. I welcome any feedback or thoughts on this project.</p>

            <p>I have a deep passion for this type of hardware hacking. Back in 1984, during my 8th grade science project, I used a combination of TTL chips, LEDs, and salvaged fiber optic cables to create a project similar to this one. While my project was not as fast as modern technology, I had no guidance on parallel ports and clock pulses. In a rural area in Ontario, I successfully implemented a bit-shift register between a PLC-5 and a MicroLogix 1000 by using a single 120V AC input to load a preset into a high-speed counter. However, I am concerned about potential risks with the I/O update occurring during a routine. I have yet to open and import the data to fully understand your process.</p>

            <p>Drbitboy - In the past, I dabbled with serial communication for basic tasks like passing alarm numbers. However, I knew there had to be a better way. After thinking about it before going to bed last night, I had some free time today and managed to make it work. I made countless mistakes along the way, but that's what testing is for, right? Thanks to Ken's help!

Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to learn these skills when I was younger; I was always expected to do manual labor. However, I always had an interest and finally decided to step up and learn something new. It's never too late to learn new things!

I considered using a shift register but ultimately chose a different approach. Time-based logic can be tricky, but for this non-critical task of updating an alarm string with around 30 characters, a 5-second update time should suffice.

I didn't have the necessary I/O cards or two PLCs to work with, but I was able to prove the concept. Hopefully, I'll have the chance to test it in the office soon. The suggestion about I/O updates was spot on.</p>

            <p>In the distant past, I have successfully implemented a few projects using handshaking bits instead of timers for efficient communication. By utilizing 7 bits for characters and allocating one bit for each direction for handshaking, I was able to achieve a fast and reliable transmission. In another project, I utilized relay outputs with a PLC, which proved to be durable and lasted for at least 3 years. I did not revisit the project after that timeframe.</p>

            <p>Oh, I see what you're saying - I understand that this is the requested method. I'm just trying to figure out what to do with the remaining 8 bits in ASCII, which conveniently fits within 128. I can't just leave one hanging, right? In the past, I would assign decimal values for the first 7 alarms, but then you're limited to only 127 alarms and you should never use 0 as an alarm number. The last bit could be used as a confirmation/done bit. However, with ASCII, you have the flexibility to assign any value to the alarm number. How should we utilize the last bit effectively?</p>

            <p>This setup is completely hardwired with no additional connections or expansion options on the chassis. It's all old Compact equipment, specifically the L32 model. I had to really convince them to give me 8 outputs and 8 inputs to work with. The system can handle up to 127 alarms, but dealing with controls and budget constraints led me down a frustrating path. Despite the challenges, I have to admit it was a somewhat enjoyable experience.</p>

            <p>If someone decides to implement the logic I mentioned, I have some questions. I reduced the receiving side of the logic timer to 265 milliseconds, which allowed me to successfully receive around 16/17 consecutive characters before encountering an error. The timer on the sending end is set to 250 ms, resulting in an average character rate of 16.7 per second. I am curious about the presence of a null character at the beginning of the decoded string, which corresponds to a decimal value of 0. String lengths tend to cause issues with the PLC, so I may need to revisit the logic to address this. It's important to note that this is a test running on a single PLC in a routine. Adding multiple PLCs, different scan times, wire lengths, and I/O debounce may not be feasible. I plan to optimize the process by sticking to 8-bit data transmission for reliability, even if it means slower but consistent performance. The ultimate goal is to update an overhead LED display connected to the receiving PLC. In other news, Wapakoneta is expecting a massive influx of visitors for the eclipse, with over 100,000 visitors projected over the weekend. I'll be keeping an eye on things from my front yard, making sure no one steps on my lawn. See you all next week.</p>

            <p>Rayman_7676 commented on the I/O update, suggesting the use of CPS instructions for the final moves to and from I/O to prevent interruptions during the update. Utilizing the eighth bit to send a "CLK" for transferring and indexing the counter, it is advisable to let the bits settle after the CLK bit transitions on the send side by incorporating GRT Index_OUT_TON.ACC 200OTE Local_Out.8 as the clock. Eliminating the need for TON timers on the send side, one can instead increment a dint on every scan cycle as a makeshift timer. Using bit 6 or bit 7 as the index trigger, the system can send a character every N scan cycles before resetting. Despite 8-bit ASCII being ISO-8859-1/8869/LATIN-1, true ASCII is 7-bit. Streamlining the process can enhance clarity and efficiency while optimizing the use of vertical space.</p>

            <p>Spending 10 digital points on that was not the most efficient choice. You could have easily implemented an I2C or SPI driver with fewer resources. Speaking of which, my first experience with a "remote IO" system was with a Siemens Mux/Demux setup that functioned similar to a shift register for controlling outputs and reading inputs.</p>

            <p>In the process of incorporating a 250ms delay on each character, it has been observed that another programmable logic controller (PLC) is tracking the character index during every scan. Is this communication directed towards me or the original poster (OP)? I suggest replacing the TON with an integer that increments with each scan. When this integer reaches a specific power of 2, it should reset to 0, such as utilizing the logic AND operation with FFH. Additionally, the rising edge of the highest bit (bit 7 when the AND operand is FFH) can serve as the trigger for this operation.</p>

In summary, the output coder includes a TON timer set at a 250ms delay for each addition, while the input coder adds during every scan if the code is interpreted correctly.</p>

            <p>Lare mentioned that the RelaxTo OP.Output coder utilizes a timer with a 250ms delay for adding, while the Input coder adds scan by scan if the code is understood correctly. In Rung 10, the index is only incremented if a new non-zero character is detected on the wires, or if a 350ms (now 265ms) timer expires with the same character on the wires. This suggests that they are leveraging all the bits as ORed CLKs, or a timer for their operation.</p>
