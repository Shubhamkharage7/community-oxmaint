            <p>A common issue in labeling machines is the misalignment or lack of detection of the gap between labels by the fork type sensor that detects the label's trailing edge. Additionally, it is important to ensure the bottle sensor accurately detects the presence of a bottle and does not stay on when no bottle is present.Troubleshooting these sensors is essential for optimal machine performance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In most cases, a fork type sensor is used to detect the trailing edge of a label. If this sensor is misaligned or not detecting the gap between labels, it could be causing the issue. Additionally, check if the bottle sensor is accurately detecting a bottle or if it remains on even when no bottle is present. The label sensor model is Leuze GS 61/6D.2 (without knob volume) and the bottle sensor is a Panasonic FX100. Despite only one glass bottle being detected, the label continues to feed. A video demonstrating this issue with the sensor detection is available. The label sensor is functioning properly, successfully detecting every label and gap.</p>

            <p>I will troubleshoot the labeler to identify any missed settings or potential issues. It appears that I may need to follow the same steps as Parky in inspecting the fork sensor that distinguishes between labels at the end. Additionally, a malfunctioning stop command relay for the motor could be causing the problem.</p>

            <p>If the control board of a labeller features LED indicators for inputs and outputs, you can perform simple tests to ensure its functionality. Try passing a bottle across the sensor and observe if the corresponding input reacts. The same test can be done with the label sensor. It's important to identify the type of controller used on the labeller - is it a PLC system or a custom-built one? In my experience, labellers can vary in their controllers, with some having a compact PLC system and others having their own unique controller without indicators.</p>
