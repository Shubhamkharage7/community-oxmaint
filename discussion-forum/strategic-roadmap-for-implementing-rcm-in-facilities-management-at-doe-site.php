            <p>Dear Shelley,

I have included an article titled "Beyond RCM" for you to review. This article, written approximately a year ago, has been widely published. It delves into the crucial role of RCM Analysts in the post-implementation phase of RCM, highlighting their responsibilities, time commitments, and potential outcomes.

While the article provides a general overview, it does not delve into specific timelines for organizational achievements. This is because each RCM implementation is unique, with its own set of challenges and impacts.

I trust that you will find this article intriguing and beneficial for your understanding. 

Warm regards,

            <p>Shelley, I am curious about when it is best to utilize the backfit approach over the classic approach, especially in relation to the NAVSEA presentation. As I am primarily dealing with existing equipment and established maintenance programs, I have only ever used the classic RCM methods, specifically zero-based analysis. I would love to hear about any instances where the backfit method has been successfully implemented, as it appears to yield great results in the Navy. From what I understand, the backfit method involves evaluating each existing maintenance task to determine its effectiveness. Is this step only necessary after conducting a classic RCM analysis with FMEA? Looking forward to your insights. Howard.</p>

            <p>Shelley: The backfit process plays a crucial role in ensuring the effectiveness of maintenance practices, as highlighted in a Maintenance Effectiveness Review (MER). More information about this process can be accessed through an iPresentation on ReliabilityWeb. It is a valuable tool that can be utilized post-RCM implementation or to assess current maintenance strategies. In my opinion, implementing RCM first is advisable. Are you affiliated with a contracting company or the US Department of Energy (DOE)? Howard.</p>

            <p>Hello Howard, I am currently employed at Sandia National Labs and our focus is on optimizing RCM implementation for our facilities equipment. Having been out of the RCM scene since 1998, I am researching to gather insights on recent successful strategies from other professionals. Engaging in discussion forums has proven to be beneficial in this quest. I am eager to dive back into RCM practices, ensuring that we approach it with precision. Thank you, Shelley.</p>

These classes cover both programs and are conducted in conjunction with CACI in Norfolk. Feel free to email me for more information (I think the training is available to all government personnel, not just military). Additionally, you can find downloads on processes on one of my personal websites: http://www.motordiagnostics.com/presentations.htm. Best Regards, Howard.</p>
