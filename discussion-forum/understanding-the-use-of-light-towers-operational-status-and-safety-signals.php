                    <p>Hello everyone, I have a query regarding light towers and their usage. Traditionally, I have always understood light tower indicators to follow a simple pattern - green for operational status and red for emergencies or stoppage. However, I have also observed light towers being used in a traffic light-like manner, with green indicating safety to proceed and red signaling caution. Is there a universal standard for the use of light towers in this way? Your insights are appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Based on my observations, the direction of a company is often influenced by customer demands or operational strategies, leading to a variety of interpretations.</p>

            <p>When it comes to safety standards, we often look to IEC60073 for guidance on identifying danger with red, warning with amber, and safety with green. However, it is important for companies to establish consistency across all sites by following a specific internal standard. This ensures uniformity and clarity in safety protocols.</p>

            <p>One of my clients has a production line imported from Taiwan. Typically, the green light is illuminated when the line is operating smoothly. The yellow light may be steady or flashing, without any clear indication of why it transitions to flashing. The red light flashes approximately 75% of the time, alongside the yellow and green lights, without any alerts on the HMI system. 

Another client uses a color-coded system for communication on their machines. In this system, red signifies that the operator needs to speak with their supervisor, yellow indicates a maintenance request, and green signifies a need for a forklift. Some machines also have a blue light, which signals a request for a quality control person or assistance from an operator on a neighboring machine. It should be noted that these machines are German-made, with instructions and PLC descriptions provided in German. The translated term for their system is "Traffic Light."</p>

            <p>Thank you for the responses. I believe that having a standardized procedure at a local level is crucial for maintaining consistency within plants. I will also be researching the IEC60073 norm as part of this effort. Shoutout to the Detroit team - my memories of Ann Arbor will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>

            <p>Typically, the plant-level standard I have observed across various automotive manufacturing facilities involves color-coded stack lights. In this system, green signifies that a machine is running in auto mode, with flashing indicating a run-out or emptying cycle. A red light indicates a machine fault, flashing for new alarms. Yellow denotes a warning, while blue indicates that a machine requires material - flashing when low and solid when empty, or when in "demand hold" due to lack of space for finished parts at the next machine. Additionally, there is an area light that switches between green (magazine can be removed) and red (elevator raised, magazine cannot be removed). These stack lights also convey information related to material handling, material availability, and supervisor presence.</p>

            <p>At the plant level, I have experience working at food manufacturing facilities where we utilized signal lights for operational purposes. Green solid indicated the system was running smoothly, while green flashing meant it was ready to start. A yellow light indicated a warning or an oven temperature issue, while red signaled an alarm or fault. Additionally, blue lights indicated that safety contactors were energized. These visual signals were essential for maintaining a safe and efficient production process.</p>
