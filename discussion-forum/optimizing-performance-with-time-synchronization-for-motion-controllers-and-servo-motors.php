                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello there, our equipment features motion controllers, servo motors, and Power Flex 527, all requiring time synchronization for optimal performance. Our company plans to incorporate Factory Talk Asset Center in the coming months, necessitating all equipment to be connected to a single network. While most machines are already networked in preparation for this transition, we are experiencing time synchronization alarms on three machines. These alarms, such as Clock Sync Alarm and Clock Jitter Alarm, are affecting two machines running on 5069-L310ERM and one on 5069-L320ERM controllers. To address this issue, it is crucial to have only one system time master on the network, ensuring consistency across all machines.
For example, Machine 1 has its first port set to 192.168.0.10 connected to the main network, with the second port linked to Kinetix 5500 at 192.168.1.1. Similarly, Machine 2 and Machine 3 are configured in a similar manner. One potential solution could be using NAT routers on each machine to help maintain the controllers on the same network while ensuring the drives recognize the connected controller as the time master.
Additionally, there seems to be a performance lag when online with any of these controllers, possibly linked to the time synchronization issues. This lag is evident when the mouse cursor intermittently becomes the blue processing circle, indicating a delay in execution. Addressing the time synchronization problem among the three controllers may improve overall system performance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure proper synchronization, check the "Enable Time Synchronization" box for all controllers on the Date/Time tab of the Controller Properties dialog. Press the Advanced button in the same dialog and adjust the "Master Override" setting on the 320ERM controller with the most drives to a value lower than the others, such as 100 if the default is 128. Confirm the grandmaster clock controller using this dialog. If necessary, bring the clocks of the other controllers into closer alignment for synchronization. Consider utilizing a network switch with PTP capabilities as the grandmaster clock for improved synchronization, as switches can sync to NTP whereas PLCs cannot (although there is an AOI available).</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Time synchronization has been active since the program's inception, ensuring all components are aligned. Despite adjusting priorities, the controller with the lower number dominates as the master. After implementing steps outlined in article ID: QA36495 from the knowledgebase, each drive now recognizes its respective controller as the time master. Nevertheless, the controllers are still experiencing intermittent delays, causing frustration when using the system. These delays occur every 1-2 seconds, represented by a spinning circle cursor. This impedes workflow and delays tasks such as online changes. It is unclear if this issue is linked to time synchronization or if there are other underlying factors at play.</p>

            <p>tjntjntjn discussed the issue of time synchronization within a program. Despite turning on time synchronization since the program's inception, there are still issues present. Changing the priority does not seem to make a difference, although the controller with the lower number becomes the master. After consulting article ID: QA36495 in the knowledgebase and following its instructions, each drive now looks to the connected controller as the time master. However, there are still "lags" with each controller every 1-2 seconds, causing the mouse to turn into a circle. This delay is frustrating as it impedes the ability to make online changes promptly. It is unclear if this is still a time synchronization issue or if it is related to something else.

Regarding the issue of the mouse turning into a circle, it may be due to the program saving to a backup (.bak) file. It is recommended to navigate to tools options and verify if automatic backups are enabled. Adjusting the backup frequency to around every 5 minutes could potentially resolve this issue. If this suggestion does not address the problem, it may be best to seek further assistance.</p>

            <p>saultgeorge has suggested checking if the program is saving to a backup file (.bak) and ensuring that automatic backups are enabled in the tools options. It is advisable to adjust the frequency of saving to around every 5 minutes for optimal performance. If the issue persists, it may be specific to the three mentioned controllers and not occurring with other programs while online. Auto-save settings are confirmed to be set at every 10 minutes, remaining unchanged. Any further assistance with programming concerns can be provided.</p>

            <p>I suspect the problem lies in time synchronization. I plan to troubleshoot by disconnecting two controllers from the network, most likely on the weekend, to determine if this persistent "mouse" issue is resolved. This should help identify the root cause and improve overall system performance.</p>

            <p>I once encountered the same issue and resolved it by setting up a Network Address Translation (NAT) on each device to allow them to operate independently as their own time source. This setup effectively prevents any conflicts between devices. Since implementing this solution, the issue has not resurfaced.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>muusic_man shared a solution to a common problem experienced with PLCs and drives. By implementing a NAT on each piece of equipment, they were able to designate each device as its own time master, preventing any interference between them. This approach ensured that drives connected to different PLCs would not attempt to connect to a different time master, ultimately resolving the issue permanently.</p>

            <p>With a vast network comprising approximately 150 PLC's and HMI's, some integrated with servos, spread across different buildings and connected through various switches, a one-time master system proved ineffective due to delays in time syncing causing errors. Collaborating with Rockwell, the solution involved implementing a NAT at each servo-containing PLC to prevent conflicts between syncing to a network master. This approach has been successful, eliminating previous issues and ensuring seamless operation.</p>
