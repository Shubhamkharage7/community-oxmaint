                    <p>Why does Ctrl+S not create a backup file in Studio 5000, but saving by hitting the button does? My project became corrupted the following day. The acd file was last saved at 6pm yesterday, but the latest backup was from 11am on the same day. Losing 6 hours of crucial work was devastating, but luckily I had downloaded it to the plc, allowing me to upload and retrieve all my work.</p>

            <p>Have you considered setting your auto backup to a frequency of less than 6 hours? I personally have mine set to every 10 minutes, ensuring minimal loss of work in case of any unexpected technical hiccups. Don't risk losing valuable work by not setting up regular auto backups!</p>

            <p>When using CTRL+S, it is expected to overwrite the current file instead of creating a backup. If this is not the case, please let me know if I am mistaken.</p>

            <p>According to OkiePC, pressing CTRL+S should replace the current file instead of creating a backup. He mentioned Studio 5000 typically generates multiple backup files every time a save command is initiated.</p>
