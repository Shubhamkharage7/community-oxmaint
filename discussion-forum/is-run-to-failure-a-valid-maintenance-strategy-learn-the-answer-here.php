            <p>When it comes to maintenance and reliability, the ultimate goal is to provide value efficiently. It's important not to waste resources trying to prevent inevitable failures or spending more on prevention than the cost of the failure itself. While options like redesigning are available, it may not make sense to spend $2000 annually to prevent a failure that only costs $500 every 5 years. However, it's crucial to consider safety and environmental risks when choosing a maintenance approach. It's essential to focus on the failure mode level and ensure that any maintenance task is justified financially and in terms of risk management. Maintenance tasks should not only be applicable but also effective in preventing failures.</p>

            <p>When developing a successful strategy, it is important to consider both the criticality of the situation and the economical parameters involved. In this scenario, the main focus is on the criticality factor, which is closely followed by comparing the cost of preventative maintenance (PM) to the cost of failure. This comparison helps determine the most efficient and cost-effective approach to handling the situation.</p>

            <p>Dokken discussed the importance of creating a maintenance strategy based on criticality and cost considerations. Criticality plays a major role, along with comparing the costs of preventive maintenance versus the costs of failure. After an in-depth conversation with partners and analyzing various examples, it was agreed that "run to fail" is a valid maintenance strategy. This approach involves addressing failures by eliminating them and considering the economic impact as well.</p>

            <p>Indeed, running equipment until it fails can be considered a maintenance strategy. This approach is typically reserved for situations where the risk of failure is considered low impact and the cost of repair after failure is less burdensome than proactive maintenance measures. In such cases, it may be more cost-effective to address issues after they occur rather than investing resources in preventative maintenance.</p>

            <p>While some may refer to it as "Run to Replace," I believe it is essential to plan for replacements before components fail. Even components that are supposed to run until failure will eventually require parts and labor to fix. If maintenance labor is diverted from critical tasks to address a failing component, it increases overall risk. By addressing issues before they lead to failure, costs associated with spare parts can be avoided. Don't assume that just because a component is labeled as "Run to Replace/Failure," there is no need for continuous monitoring using sensors or condition-based maintenance processes. Stay proactive to minimize risks and costs associated with component failures.</p>

            <p>I believe that implementing a "Run to failure" strategy can be effective. It is crucial to assess the criticality of the equipment first, as well as calculate the costs associated with both potential failure and preventive maintenance (PM). If the cost of PM outweighs the cost of failure, then running to failure may be the best option. However, determining the true costs and criticality of the equipment can be a challenge for many professionals in the industry.</p>

            <p>Implementing a proactive maintenance strategy can yield positive results, especially when maintenance windows are kept short or equipment can be halted at any moment for immediate corrections.

            <p>Effective asset monitoring is essential for cost-saving and maximizing performance. In the past, faulty monitoring has led to wastage on non-critical assets, outweighing any potential savings. Conversely, neglecting monitoring on critical assets can result in costly failures. It is crucial to regularly assess and document monitoring and preventive maintenance strategies, allowing for adjustments based on changing factors. This continuous analysis ensures optimal asset management and cost-efficiency.</p>

            <p>At this point, we often get caught up in the details of semantics. I believe that if your analysis shows that the expenses for replacing a malfunctioning part, repairing any associated damage, and accounting for lost production or spoiled products are lower than the costs of monitoring and maintaining the item, then it may be suitable for a Run To Failure approach. However, it is likely that some level of monitoring can lead to cost savings compared to simply waiting for things to break down. The key is utilizing data to decide what to monitor, how to monitor it, and how frequently, without getting too caught up in categorizing the strategy. Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Implementing a "Run to Failure" or "Reactive Maintenance" strategy may seem like an easy option, but it is not always the best choice. The only exception to this rule would be if there is equipment redundancy in place that can be activated instantly. While some machines may be used infrequently but still contribute to production, neglecting maintenance on them may not impact the timing of replacement or repair. When comparing the cost of replacement versus investing in a Reliability Program, it is vital to consider various factors beyond just the initial unit cost. Factors such as safety, lost production, availability of replacement parts and machines, labor costs, and inventory expenses need to be taken into account. Machines under a "run to failure" plan often exhibit vibration issues before completely breaking down. Operating a machine with high vibration levels can lead to increased energy consumption over time, resulting in higher operational costs. Additionally, storing spare parts and motors for potential failures can incur significant expenses, especially if the replacement parts are unreliable or degraded due to long-term storage. It is essential to have a comprehensive inventory management system in place to deal with any unexpected breakdowns. Ultimately, choosing between a Reliability Program and a "Run to Failure" approach comes down to more than just availability of equipment redundancy. It is crucial to weigh the potential risks and costs associated with each strategy to ensure optimal operational efficiency and minimize downtime.</p>

            <p>Utilizing a "run to failure" approach is not considered a comprehensive maintenance strategy, but rather a tactical decision to be made based on specific circumstances and asset management objectives. This method is typically employed on individual assets when the total cost of failure is deemed lower than the maintenance costs. Various Reliability Centered Maintenance decision trees can aid in this decision-making process. Ultimately, "run to failure" is just one of several options available when creating an asset management plan, with the choice dependent on the organization's overall asset management strategy and the comparison of total cost of ownership among different options.</p>
