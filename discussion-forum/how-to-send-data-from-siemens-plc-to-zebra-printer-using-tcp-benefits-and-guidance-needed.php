                    <p>I own a Siemens 315 PLC and need to send data to a Zebra 105SL Plus barcode printer. I have the option to connect with either serial or Ethernet TCP. While I initially considered getting a serial interface card, I am now contemplating the benefits of using TCP instead. This would eliminate the need for a serial card and cable. However, I am unfamiliar with TCP and would appreciate any guidance from those who have experience in this area. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>To optimize the setup, ensure the Zebra printer is configured as the TCP server ready to receive a connection from the client, which is set up as the PLC. Consider testing a different port on the Zebra if needed. It's unclear what settings need to be adjusted on the Zebra end. Can you access the terminal with HyperTerminal or Putty? It is possible to modify the port through the web server interface. Good luck!</p>

            <p>In the past, I utilized Tcp.zip, a S7 library containing FB707, for managing T blocks (T_send, rec, con, disc). While I have not updated the blocks recently, they may require some tender loving care. By using Tcp.zip as a wrapper, you can easily set up parameters in one centralized location. Take a look at the included screenshot of a cell currently running with this setup. Hopefully, this information is beneficial to you.</p>

Upon successfully establishing the connection, attempting to retrigger the TCON resulted in an error message stating "Attempt being made to re-establish an existing connection". I discovered a workaround for this issue with the TCON - after triggering it, make sure to capture the results promptly as the process may not be visibly executed and can remain stuck at 7000. This tip can help streamline the connection process and avoid potential errors.</p>

This code has been incredibly valuable in troubleshooting my connection issues, but I am now building a new codebase from the ground up, incorporating the insights I've gained. I find it beneficial to have custom function blocks tailored to the specific devices I'm controlling, so I'm currently developing a function block to interface with a zebra printer.

I enjoy observing how others code. In the past, I used to organize separate blocks for different devices, but it became too overwhelming to maintain, so I transitioned to using more 'general' blocks. Best of luck with your project!</p>

            <p>After adapting the example code to work with the Zebra printer, a screenshot of the customized Function Block (FB) is included. To use it, simply input a unique connection ID and the printer's IP address. The FB automatically detects printer disconnections and reconnections. Additionally, a separate FB was created to format the barcode printing using Zebra's ZPL language. This FB generates two essential strings: the date/time and the barcode's serial number. To ensure accuracy, the printer's date and time must match the PLC's. Each time a connection is established, the PLC's date/time is sent to the printer. Your assistance in reaching this point is greatly appreciated, and I hope this information proves beneficial to others in the future.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing your code for connecting to a Zebra printer. It has been extremely helpful in setting up the printer connection. However, I am unsure about how to properly format the data for printing. Do you have a simple example demonstrating how to construct the string to be sent to the printer? Currently, I have created a database where each byte includes an ASCII character, with all the characters combined to form the message to be printed (including ZPL language symbols). This database is then used as input for the TSEND function block. Are there alternative methods for managing the data for printing? I will not be able to test my code until next week, and I am feeling apprehensive about this aspect.</p>

            <p>Achieving success in printing from a Zebra printer via Ethernet is possible. If you need a PLC example, feel free to reach out to me at [email protected] I have successfully implemented this on a Micrologix 1400 and an S7-300 Siemens PLC, and am currently working on integrating it with the Compactlogix. It's worth noting that this process can consume a significant amount of memory.</p>

            <p>When the return value "7000" appears on a TSEND instruction, it indicates that no active job is currently being performed. Typically, a send action is initiated by a rising edge on the REQ input, causing the status to change from 7000 to a different value, such as 7001 or 7002. Once the task is completed, the status returns to 7000. This status change occurs very quickly, making it difficult to observe in real time. Previously, I developed software for S7-1500 PLCs in collaboration with a Zebra printer, and it has been functioning effectively.

For successful commissioning, I recommend using a terminal application like the Hercules Setup Utility. With this tool, you can test the functionality of the TSEND instruction by sending and receiving ASCII strings through TCP server and client connections. Similarly, the terminal application can be used to configure string settings for the printer. By connecting to the Zebra printer, acting as a TCP server, you can send strings and view the printer output in real time.

I am willing to share the software developed for S7-1500, as it may be applicable to S7-300 systems as well. In my experience, utilizing the TSEND_C instruction has proven to be simpler and more efficient, as it combines the functions of TCON, TDISCON, and TSEND into one instruction. Previously, I used the TSEND instruction separately, and it also yielded successful results.</p>

            <p>Mrkvak explained that when the return value is "7000" on a TSEND instruction, it indicates that no active job is being performed. Typically, the send action is triggered by a rising edge on the REQ input, resulting in the status changing to something other than 7000 (such as 7001 or 7002). Once the task is completed, the status reverts back to 7000 momentarily, making it difficult to observe in online view. Mrkvak previously developed software for S7-1500 with a Zebra printer, which has been successful.

For seamless commissioning, it is recommended to utilize a terminal application like the Hercules Setup utility. This allows testing of TCP server, client connections, and verification of TSEND instruction functionality by receiving ASCII strings in the terminal. Conversely, the terminal application can also be used to configure strings for the printer. By connecting to the Zebra printer, acting as a TCP server, users can send strings and monitor the printer output.

Although sharing the S7-1500 software is possible, it is not available for S7-300 models. However, the process should be similar. The TSEND_C instruction is preferred as it simplifies the task by combining TCON, TDISCON, and TSEND in one instruction. Previously, the TSEND instruction was used successfully.

If there are issues with connecting to Hercules for testing, posting the S7-1500 project with TSEND_C implementation could be helpful. This would aid in ruling out any programming-related issues and ensuring seamless functionality.</p>

            <p>Utilizing a Zebra printer with PLC S7-1500 can be achieved with the following steps. First, create and design your label using Zebra Designer software. Next, test the label by printing it from the Zebra Designer program. Then, print the label to a file to obtain the ZPL code necessary for printing via TCP. Identify the specific field in the ZPL code that needs to be modified. Use a terminal application (such as Hercules Setup Utility) to establish a TCP connection to the printer and test printing the ZPL code. Verify the printer's configuration through the web interface, typically on port 6101. Finally, compose the full ZPL code in the PLC as a string.

            <p>Mrkvak suggested a method that has proven effective for setting up and printing labels using a Zebra printer. First, design your label using Zebra Designer and print a test label to ensure it looks correct. Next, save the prepared label as a file to access the ZPL code needed to send to the printer via TCP. Identify and modify the necessary fields in the ZPL code and test the TCP connection to the printer using a terminal application like the Hercules setup utility. Once the connection is established, you can print the ZPL code using the terminal app. Make sure to configure the printer's settings through the web interface and use port 6101 for the TCP connection in your PLC. Composing the full ZPL code in PLC as a string can be challenging, but with persistence, it can be accomplished.
