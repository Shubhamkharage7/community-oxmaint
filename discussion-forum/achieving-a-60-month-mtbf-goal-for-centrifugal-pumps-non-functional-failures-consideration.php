                                <p>I believe you are on the right track with your approach to calculating the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of the pump. If you are looking to assess the entire system, which could involve components such as pumps and strainers, it is important to take into account all potential failures within that system.</p>

                                <p>At my workplace, Y7, the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) for pumps is reported monthly. One of the biggest challenges we face is ensuring consistency in our criteria. A crucial step is establishing clear definitions for pump boundaries and ensuring all staff members adhere to the same guidelines. For instance, it's important to determine which components are considered part of a pump at your specific facility. This includes items such as shaft couplings, instrumentation like shaft vibration probes and bearing temperature elements, as well as base plates and gaskets at suction and discharge flanges.

                    <p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Non-functional failures are often excluded from MTBF calculations as they are not directly related to the reliability of the pump itself, but rather external factors that can affect its performance.</p>

                    <p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: A 60-month MTBF goal indicates a high level of reliability and performance for the centrifugal pumps, ensuring extended periods of operation without significant failures or downtime.</p>
