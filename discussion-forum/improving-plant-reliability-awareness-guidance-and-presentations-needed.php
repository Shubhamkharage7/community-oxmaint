            <p>Hello Jim, I wish I could assist your organization, but I am currently working in the UK. Training on reliability awareness and asset management is crucial for capital-intensive industries looking to maximize their asset value. Our programs cover a range of topics including:

1. Strategic Asset Planning - A one-day corporate course for board members and senior executives focusing on increasing knowledge and awareness of asset benefits.
2. Technical Overviews - A comprehensive one-day course on advanced reliability and asset management concepts with industry-specific insights.
3. Risk Assessment and Mitigation - One-day training dispelling misconceptions around risk management and highlighting its importance in operations and spending decisions.
4. RCM - Root Cause Analysis is a key aspect of asset management and is essential for organizational success.
5. Leading Practice Maintenance - Detailed insights on optimizing capital and operational expenditure for maximum benefits.

Additional courses on Maintenance Scorecard, Planning and Scheduling, Data management, and creating Asset Information Portfolios are available based on client needs. These customized courses aim to enhance overall awareness and interest in reliability practices. Feel free to reach out to me at darylm@strategic-advantages.com for more information. Best regards, Daryl Mather. Visit our website at http://www.strategic-advantages.com for more details.</p>

            <p>Two years ago, I created a Powerpoint presentation on Reliability Awareness specifically designed for technicians and mechanics. While it may not meet the standards of a presentation by a professional in reliability, it is still useful. If you are interested, I can send it to you. The file size is approximately 5 MB, but I can divide it into smaller parts for easier sending.</p>

            <p>Why is reliability awareness important, especially in the oil and gas sector? While it may not be a novel concept, the importance of reliability cannot be understated. It is crucial for all plant managers and industry professionals to understand the significance of reliability in ensuring smooth operations and preventing costly downtime. So, why do we still need to emphasize the importance of reliability in today's industrial landscape?</p>

            <p>Dear Sir, I concur that the focus on reliability is a common practice in the oil and gas industry. However, this emphasis may sometimes be misplaced. Unlike other sectors, such as capital-intensive industries, there is a lack of understanding of the potential benefits that reliability initiatives can bring. Some organizations may also struggle with promoting a culture of reliability within their teams. It is essential to provide training on reliability awareness to address these issues and introduce new perspectives and best practices. This training can help in correcting outdated paradigms and ensuring the implementation of leading practices within the organization. While reliability awareness training may not be frequently requested, it is often a crucial component of corporate initiatives.

            <p>Daryl is correct in noting that the gas and oil industry has been a pioneer in embracing reliability. Other industries are now working to catch up, but it can be challenging to change the mindset of traditional thinkers. Many may not fully understand the expectations for reliability. Increasing awareness as a team and expanding this mindset to various departments will be beneficial. For further information, please email a copy to jmaslach@mortonsalt.com.

            <p>If you want to enhance craft personnel's understanding of how their actions impact equipment reliability, consider enrolling in the Loctite Mechanical Basics course. In this training, you will learn about Failure Fundamentals and the crucial role of Machinery Adhesives in maintaining equipment reliability. I recently completed this course and was impressed by the insightful presentation, which greatly benefited craft personnel. The knowledge gained from this course can be easily applied to equipment repairs. - Steve Shores
