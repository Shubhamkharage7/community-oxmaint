            <p>ASF mentioned that when using System Platform, they have the ability to manipulate attributes, tags, and other properties directly through the object viewer. However, when working with a standalone InTouch application, the question arises of how to write to an InTouch tag (specifically a Memory Message data type) without displaying it on a screen with a data entry field. The focus is on setting a "units" tag without the need for a visible input field.

One possible solution is to utilize the units field of the IO data tag itself, which is a DOT field that can be accessed for display purposes. Alternatively, if the preference is to store the value in a memory message tag, the initial value can be configured to the desired setting within the tag's configuration.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Robertmee suggested utilizing the units field within the IO data tag for easier accessibility on display. If you prefer using a memory message tag to store a value, make sure to set the initial value in the tag's configuration. Although there are more efficient methods available, I am constrained to work within the current structure. It seems like the OEM previously set tag values on an "OEM" screen and later removed it from the configuration.</p>

            <p>ASF has mentioned that despite setting the initial value, the existing tag value is not being updated. While there may be better methods to handle this situation, ASF is constrained by the current structure and is unable to make significant changes. It appears that the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) established an "OEM" screen in the past to set these tag values, which was later removed from the configuration. It is important to note that updating the initial value will only refresh the memory tag, unless it is configured as retentive, in which case it will retain the last value.</p>

            <p>It appears that a script or another mechanism may be dictating its behavior, as it stubbornly resists any attempts to alter it. Despite my efforts to cross-reference, it only appears to be utilized in animations on certain screens. The incomplete cross-reference raises questions, as I am aware of at least two other screens where it is being used but not listed. How can I further investigate and trace what is controlling its settings?</p>

            <p>ASF expressed puzzlement at the situation, noting that there may be a script or other mechanism causing the refusal to change. Despite searching the cross reference and only finding it used in animations on a few displays, ASF believes the reference is incomplete. There are at least two other displays where it is used in animations but does not appear in the search results. ASF is seeking alternative methods to identify what is causing the issue.

Inquiring about the version being used is important, as the 2017 and 2020 versions are known for having faulty cross references. One may need to manually review each window and script, save them again, and hope for the best. Older versions such as 2014 tend to work better in this regard. Additionally, tags formed dynamically with indirect references may not appear in the cross reference results.

For example, "InAnalog.Name = MyAnalog.Name" will cross reference "MyAnalog," but "IndAnalog = 'MyAnalog'" will not show up in the results. Both syntaxes are valid, but the latter is avoided due to this reason. ASF has various versions of the software on virtual machines and is willing to assist if needed.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it appears that this application was recently upgraded from 2014 to 2020. With approximately 100 displays and a similar number of scripts, it would be time-consuming to open and save them all. I appreciate the offer to evaluate the application, but the client may not be comfortable with me sharing it. Considering it is only utilized in a few locations, I am inclined to remove the text animation and manually input the units. It may not be worth delving into someone else's problematic code further.</p>

            <p>ASF mentioned that the application was recently transitioned from 2014 to 2020. With approximately 100 displays and countless scripts, opening and saving them all would be time-consuming. While grateful for the offer to review the application, ASF noted that the client may not feel comfortable with sharing it. With the application only being utilized in a few places, ASF plans to simplify by removing text animation and hard coding the units. It may not be worth the effort to further untangle someone else's complex system.

The process of converting from 2014 to 2017 or 2020 often poses challenges with tag indices. It used to be possible to delete tagname.avl to reset the tagname index, but that method was discontinued after Intouch 10. Therefore, the best approach is to manually review each screen and script to address any issues with unused tags and cross-references.

            <p>In some cases, the 2020 cross reference may not display all information. A useful workaround is to print the application to a text file, excluding images. Once done, you can easily search for your filename using Notepad++ or another preferred text editor. Be aware that this process may take some time, especially for larger applications and depending on your computer's processing power. The resulting text file will likely be quite large.</p>
