            <p>When identifying safety-critical equipment and systems, it is recommended to start with your installation's functional system and equipment tagging system. This process typically includes assessing instrument protective functions, electrical safeguarding systems with protective relays, mechanical integrity systems such as pressure safety valves and check valves, fire detection and suppression systems, and emergency response protocols. It is important to consider whether equipment without redundancy, whose failure would halt production, should be classified as production-critical and given the highest priority in your Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).

While the mentioned factors are essential, there may be additional criteria to consider. It is worth exploring other methodologies like Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) to determine a comprehensive list of critical equipment. Additionally, it is important to understand and comply with Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards related to equipment safety.</p>

            <p>After identifying the critical systems and equipment, it is essential to also monitor plant changes, whether permanent or temporary, that could impact the functioning and integrity of these critical components. These changes encompass modifications, replacements, additions, deletions, upgrades, software alterations like alarm configurations, and any other temporary fixes outlined in the UKOAA guidelines. What is the significance of complying with GFSI standards?</p>

            <p>The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) undergoes audits against approved standards rooted in the Codex Alimentarius. Our choice is the IFS standard, which mandates a documented maintenance system for critical equipment, including transportation, to meet product requirements. This requirement applies to both internal and external maintenance tasks. Given the food safety and quality management nature of this scheme (similar to ISO), there is uncertainty regarding the definition of "critical." Some equipment failure leads to zero output, while others result in nonconforming products. How can we evaluate the criticality of these functions in relation to the standard's requirements?</p>

            <p>I may not be an expert in the food industry, but I do have knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry and conducting criticality assessments. In your situation, maintaining process integrity is crucial due to the potential escalation of biological hazards. Therefore, equipment that offers protection against such threats, such as refrigeration, heating systems, and sanitation processes, is vital. Additionally, the behavior of individuals is key to ensuring integrity and must be properly managed through training, motivation, and testing, similar to the protocols followed by airline pilots. Your scenario is more intricate compared to challenges faced by other industries.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about Critical Equipment List criteria for the food industry? Looking for best practices and guidance related to risk assessment diagrams that align with GFSI standards? Plant Engineer Phil Grimes here, partnering with Lynn on our company's GFSI standard program. Our focus is on developing programs and specifications for our mid-sized confections facility. Our current challenge lies in defining "Critical Equipment" and establishing risk criteria. Seeking a flowchart to guide us in this process. Utilizing a CMMS system called PMC, but unsure of its role in managing critical equipment. Curious about Reliability-Centered Maintenance and its impact on defining critical equipment. While we appreciate the responses received so far, they are quite complex for us. Any beginner-friendly resources or explanations you can provide would be greatly helpful.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Our confusion arises from the interpretation of the term "Critical" and the establishment of risk criteria. Lynn requested a flowchart to aid in defining these criteria. It is suggested to consult the RCMII book for further clarification on criticality, risk criteria, and flowchart. Criticality is explained in the CMMS section below, while risk criteria are site-specific and must be determined by each site. A simple illustration of risk criteria is the formula: Risk = Probability of Failure x Consequence of Failure. High probability and consequence indicate high risk. Safety, health, production, environment, and reputation should be considered when evaluating risk. Our CMMS system, PMC, includes a Criticality field for users to indicate the importance of equipment. It is essential to prioritize maintenance based on criticality levels. RCM (Reliability-Centered Maintenance) emphasizes allocating equipment criticality and defining risk criteria for safety, production, environment, and reputation. It is recommended to familiarize yourself with the RCMII book to gain a better understanding. For further guidance, refer to the standards outlined in the RFSI document. If the explanations provided seem complex, consider starting with the first chapter of the RCMII book for a clearer introduction.</p>

            <p>When it comes to business success, profitability, safety, and sustainability are key factors. It's crucial to identify and address any threats that could impact these goals. In your industry, it's essential to consider the risks to product quality, safety (such as minimizing HSE incidents), and cost-effective production. These are critical areas that need to be monitored closely to avoid major incidents like fires, explosions, and fatalities. For example, in the oil and gas industry, process safety is paramount to prevent such events. Make sure to evaluate what threats these objectives in your case. Safety critical systems like Fire and Gas detection, Active Fire protection, and Evacuation should be in place to mitigate risks. For more insights, you may find my book "Effective Maintenance Management" helpful. Check the details below for more information.</p>

Will the Pareto principle apply to their equipment list? They specialize in confectioneries like chocolate, ensuring hygiene is a top priority. While they don't use sweet wrapping machines, they bag marshmallows using a vertical form/fill/seal machine. In a previous role, Phil worked with AMP Rose machines to wrap caramels, marvelling at their mechanical complexity.</p>

            <p>quote: Originally shared by Josh: quote: Originally shared by Lynn R: While we appreciate your responses, they seem a bit complex for us. Is there a website or a simpler explanation you could provide to help us start from scratch? After revisiting your reply, when you mention "a little involved for us", are you suggesting that my answers are too intricate or difficult to understand? If so, I initially provided straightforward responses in this thread, outlining the essential equipment list without referencing the RCMII book. Consider what happens if this equipment or system fails and the potential impact on safety, health, environment, production, and reputation. Establish the acceptable consequences for your site through risk evaluation criteria. Determine the likelihood of failure based on known historical data. It's important to identify if there are ways to detect or predict failure occurrences. By "a little involved", I meant that the discussion delved into in-depth analysis, which may be necessary but challenging. Here's a summary of our situation: A) We lack a critical equipment list. B) The definition of "critical equipment" is unclear. C) There's no flowchart guiding us on how to identify critical equipment. D) Limited historical data is available, mainly relying on memories since the CMMS program has been operational for only a year or two, primarily for scheduling PM work. -------------------- Here's a brief overview of our process: 1) We start by combining raw ingredients in a steam-jacketed cook kettle equipped with a mixer, load cells, and a pump for fluid transfer. The mixture is heated to a set temperature before being moved to a cooling kettle. The material introduction process involves flowmeters, scales, and temperature instruments. The load cells on the kettle serve as a check on delivery systems. 2) The cooling tank lowers the mixture temperature to a specific point, where flavoring, gelatin, and "remelted" product are added. These tanks include mixers, temperature sensors, load cells for basic measurements, and a discharge pump. 3) The remelting and gelatin systems function independently to supplement the main process. 4) Once the cooling goal is met, the cream mix goes into a surge tank for batching. Subsequently, a continuous process begins with air injection, creating a "marshmallow" product. The marshmallow is whipped, further cooled, extruded, coated in corn starch, cut, tumbled, bagged, boxed, and palletized. You now have a basic understanding of marshmallow production. ------------- Here are some key questions reflecting my confusion: How do we determine which equipment is "critical" in the described process? If criticality means the inability to produce the product without it (referred to as "production-critical"), then almost all equipment would fall under this category, which is unrealistic. In a facility with multiple cook and bag lines, are individual machines considered non-critical if the overall production can continue without them? Is a kettle, mixer, pump, conveyor belt, or even internal motor parts critical? Factors like microbiological issues, physical attributes, ingredient errors, shape, and size can all lead to non-conformance. Perhaps a simpler approach would be to evaluate the [potential for non-conformance] x [severity of non-conformance]. This methodology aligns with our current risk analysis practices in other areas. Thanks for bearing with my detailed explanation of our challenge. Any insights to share, or did I overwhelm everyone?</p>

            <p>While using RCMII or FMEA can be complex, the process is essential for identifying critical equipment in production plants and facilities. It is important to focus on safety-critical equipment first and assign high criticality to them. In a production plant like mine, where methanol is produced from natural gas and crude oil, it is crucial to determine which equipment is production-critical. This includes equipment that is insured, has expensive replacement costs, or lacks ready spare parts. Such equipment may be assigned medium criticality, while equipment that can be repaired onsite within acceptable completion times may be assigned low criticality. Consider the environmental and reputation damages that could occur if equipment fails or leads to loss of containment or overpressure. By evaluating the criticality of equipment based on these factors, you can improve the overall efficiency and safety of your operations.</p>

            <p>When considering the criticality of equipment in a manufacturing facility with multiple cook lines and bag lines, one must evaluate the impact of each machine's potential failure. Is a kettle critical? What about a mixer, pump, or conveyor belt? Should we assess the importance of bearings and seals within a motor or gearbox? Ultimately, the overall functionality of the production lines must be maintained. To determine criticality, one must consider the consequences of equipment failure, the likelihood of failure, and methods of detecting issues. For a visual representation, consider referencing the RCM flowchart, which can be customized to fit your specific needs.</p>

            <p>In response to the questions posed, the following points are outlined:

1. It is noted that there is a lack of a critical equipment list, which is crucial for identifying key assets within the organization.
2. The absence of defined criteria for determining what qualifies as "critical equipment" is acknowledged, prompting the need for the establishment of risk assessment parameters.
3. In addressing the issue of not having a flowchart to guide the definition of critical equipment, it is suggested to refer to exemplars found in resources such as the RCMII book.
4. Limited historical data on equipment failures is acknowledged, with the suggestion to leverage pre-existing maintenance records or industry publications to assess the likelihood of failures. 
5. The potential for utilizing the CMMS program for comprehensive maintenance management is proposed, given its recent implementation and prior focus on preventive maintenance scheduling. 

Is there a possibility of integrating all maintenance activities through CMMS for better organization and data management?</p>

            <p>quote: Josh originally suggested focusing on the most profitable product line, considering your site's multiple cook lines and bag lines. However, our three lines have the same production capabilities and do not specialize in one specific brand or product. As I was outlining the operations earlier, I realized the importance of prioritizing certain areas for production criticality. For instance, if one cook line goes down, we'd lose 33% of our capacity since all lines produce the same products. Therefore, I believe the raw material and utility systems (such as steam, compressed air, and water) are the most critical for production, as they are essential for the entire facility's operations. Do you agree with my assessment of production criticality so far?</p>

            <p>Phil, you're headed in the right direction. Once you pinpoint the key factors affecting production volume and their importance, you have determined their criticality. The question we pose is, "What impact does a 10% decrease in (one of) these factors, like power supply, water supply, or the absence of a packer, have on overall production?" Some factors may not affect production, while others could have a significant impact. The factors that result in the greatest decrease in production are the most critical. If all factors impact output similarly, we can reduce the decrease from 10% to 5% and repeat the analysis to observe the effects on production. Continue this iterative process until each factor results in a notably different decrease in output. This method provides a substantial measure of criticality. To carry out such assessments, we utilize Reliability Block Diagrams and/or Simulation Models. The underlying principle remains the same, although the initial process may be laborious.</p>

            <p>Vee made a great point about utilizing Reliability modeling for evaluating criticality. One of the main benefits of Reliability modeling is the ability to rank systems/items based on their impact on production. Additionally, simulation modeling software can provide the most likely outcome for production efficiency at a plant. This means that by using simulation modeling, you can transition from exploring "what's possible" to assessing "what's probable". Vee, I'm curious about your book "Case Studies in Maintenance and Reliability" that I ordered on Amazon.uk in August 2012 but still haven't received. Has it been published yet, or has there been a delay in the publishing process?</p>

            <p>While crafting the detailed description, I realized the importance of considering varying levels of criticality in operations. For instance, having multiple baggers to handle products from each cook line is crucial to maintaining production efficiency. With three cook lines at similar capacities, losing one line would result in a significant 33% reduction in output. The most critical areas for production are the raw material and utility systems (such as steam, compressed air, and water) as they are essential for the entire facility. It seems that your focus is on the criticality of process systems, particularly the parallel cook and bag lines, in contrast to the support systems like raw materials and utilities. Have you identified any key equipment in each system that is insured or backed up with standby units? It's also important to consider if the entire plant is insured for potential equipment failures.</p>
