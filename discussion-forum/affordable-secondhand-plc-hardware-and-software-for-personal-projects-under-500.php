            <p>I recently encountered a challenging situation while working on a Micro 8xx telemetry master PLC that had been programmed by others. The PLC was utilizing Modbus RTU over serial radio modems, and despite being programmed well overall, the setup of the Modbus Message instruction was less than ideal.

I considered replacing it with a Click PLC, but the prospect of dealing with the redundant iFix servers connected to it deterred me. The software provided by the customer frequently crashed on their computer, eventually becoming corrupted and requiring a reinstall (Version 12, if I remember correctly).

Overall, the experience was frustrating, and I found myself preferring the reliability of Click Plus for my projects.</p>

            <p>OkiePC strongly advises against using CCW software and instead suggests using Click or Click Plus with Ethernet for optimal performance. CCW is deemed subpar compared to other options. For small projects without specific manufacturing requirements, Productivity 1000 is the preferred choice, though Click Plus offers the best value for money in my opinion.</p>

            <p>While Mark deserves credit, as Scottryan03 suggested, Automation Direct may be the perfect solution for the original poster's needs. The factories I worked in aboard my last ship were powered by Automation Direct PLCs exclusively. It seemed like my predecessor had a vested interest in the company, considering they had AD drives and HMIs integrated into every system. Although AD was efficient and user-friendly, I personally prefer working with Allen Bradley products. For more information, visit https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/home/home.</p>

            <p>For those looking to get started with programmable logic controllers (PLCs), I typically recommend a Siemens S7 starter kit. Unfortunately, the popular S7-1212 CPU, KTP400 Basic HMI, and TIA Portal with Step7 Basic software included in the kit have been out of stock for quite some time. This has caused the price to go overbudget due to the HMI component. However, you can still purchase the PLC and software separately for around $500. Just be sure to avoid the S7-1211 CPU if you plan on adding extra modules in the future, as it is not expandable.</p>

Personally, I may be partial to this platform due to my frequent use of it, but it's hard to overlook the affordability of the hardware and the complimentary programming software. Additionally, the package comes with device drivers that facilitate interfacing with various industrial communication protocols.</p>

            <p>Explore CCW for free using a simulator to determine if it aligns with popular opinions. While some users describe CCW as resembling a Fisher-Price toy and encountering bugs, it surpasses AD Click in user experience. Additionally, consider trying RSLogix Micro Starter Lite (RMSL) for a visually appealing option. Utilize an emulator as demonstrated in a video tutorial to access these applications effectively. RMSL stands out for its aesthetic appeal, potentially setting high expectations for other options. eBay offers a reliable resource for affordable, pre-owned PLCs like MicroLogix 1100s compatible with RMSL programming.</p>

            <p>Ken Moore inquired whether the free AD Click software offers simulation features, expressing interest in exploring them. After downloading the software, he was impressed and considering purchasing a processor for experimentation. To get started, it seems a processor, power supply, and possibly a USB cable are needed. However, having a 24VDC power supply eliminates the need for a click power supply. Additionally, for newer processors with an ethernet port, only an ethernet cable is required. Conversely, for basic units with two RJ12 ports, a specific cable is needed. Ken Moore personally recommends investing in a processor with an ethernet port over RJ12 for enhanced functionality.</p>

            <p>As a training genius in the field of programming, I must say that the latest software updates are making things more complicated. Gone are the days when you could easily click on instructions like 'XIO, XIC' directly from the ladder. Now, editing or entering commands has become a tedious process of navigating through a long list on the side of the screen.

            <p>Ken Moore questioned whether the free AD Click software includes simulation capabilities. Unfortunately, there is no simulator, trending, or offline viewing of data values. While the software does allow for PID tagging and functions effectively in that aspect, there are limitations in terms of trending other tags. Moore has suggested the addition of this feature to enhance the software. He has also expressed frustration with the fact that some tags are not retentive by default, leading to data loss on power cycle. Despite these shortcomings, upon downloading the software, Moore was impressed and considering purchasing a processor to experiment with. To get started, a processor, power supply, and possibly a USB cable are needed.

Regarding setting up the Ethernet port, using a USB cable is recommended, especially for updating firmware to match the software version. Click with Ethernet or Click Plus outperforms Micrologix 1400 in various aspects, such as storing all comments on the PLC, editing MSG instructions live, and providing a superior PID instruction with advanced scaling and an effective Auto-tune feature.</p>

            <p>I recently purchased the most affordable Click Plus PLC, which requires 24 VDC, features (1) option slot, and includes Ethernet, serial, and microB-USB ports. The PLC does not have on-board I/O, but at just $97, it fits my needs perfectly. I plan on experimenting with it and do not require physical I/O. According to the specifications, it supports 2000 Coils, a significant improvement over older TI controllers with only 512 Coils. I already have a power supply and USB cable, so I believe I am all set. Additionally, I will receive free 2 day shipping. I have a small piece of plywood and din rail ready to go. I am excited to dive back into ladder logic and explore the possibilities, especially after working primarily with Siemens PCS7 function blocks in recent years.</p>

            <p>One of the standout features of Click that I love is its user-friendly interface for creating custom Ethernet/IP I/O tables and the option to export a customized .EDS file for easy integration with other software programs. I often utilize Click for remote I/O applications due to its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional remote I/O systems, while still offering full programmability capabilities. This is especially useful for advanced fault handling scenarios that require a more sophisticated response beyond simple output control in case of communication failures.

However, when it comes to regular PLC applications, I find Click to be somewhat lacking in polish. It serves well as a learning tool, but for more complex projects, especially those on a tight budget, I prefer using Productivity PLCs. While a P1000 may cost twice as much as a Click, the investment is still relatively affordable, and the software is provided at no extra cost. In my experience, programming with Productivity PLCs is more efficient, making it a worthwhile investment for professionals whose time is valuable and seek to maximize productivity. Ultimately, opting for a P1000 PLC can lead to cost savings in the long run.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, it's worth investing a little extra in a processor with an Ethernet port rather than just an RJ12. The Ethernet-only option is more cost-effective compared to other choices, especially when adding an IO card. In my view, there's no reason to settle for a standard Click anymore unless saving a few bucks is a major consideration.

It's frustrating to see the usability of CLICK programming software regressing with each update. Users have reported increased sluggishness and bugs in the latest versions.

Could this be the first well-known vendor to offer support for CODESYS? While there are other options available, having a single IDE is a huge advantage.
