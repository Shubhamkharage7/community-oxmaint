            <p>When you have the project open, it is automatically saved as downloaded. If you close the IDE (GXWorks) and reopen it, you should be prompted to enter the password. If not, the password may not have been set correctly. This ensures the security of your project and its data.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to protect your PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) by limiting downloads and uploads, consider adding a user in the user management function to safeguard the project from unauthorized access. This step will allow you to control access to key functions and prevent data tampering.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When working on a project in GXWorks, the software remembers the password once it has been downloaded. However, if you close the IDE and reopen it, it should prompt you for the password again. Make sure the password has been properly set up before downloading the ladder program to the PLC. I experienced an issue where the import ladder checkbox was disabled when trying to read from the PLC online. This led me to believe that the project was being protected. Despite this, an error message indicated that the project was uncompiled. Clicking next eventually brought up the ladder program.</p>
