                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Good evening everyone! I hope you are all doing well. I have a situation with my Kinetix 5500 running a robot with two axis of motion, involving Joint 1 and Joint 2. Joint 1 requires significant braking, and increasing speeds to keep up with product flow have revealed that the internal shunt resistor is inadequate. In the short term (2 days), I plan to temporarily raise the thermal threshold to 120-130% to manage the issue. However, I am wary of potential damage to the drive unit by taking this step.

For a long-term solution, I intend to install an external resistor 2097-R6 and no longer rely on the internal shunt resistor, as the stock internal resistor is only rated at 50W while the external resistor can handle up to 150W. I have ruled out any mechanical or electrical issues and have conducted numerous tests to pinpoint the problem occurring only after prolonged operation at high speeds.

I am seeking feedback from experienced individuals to ensure I am heading in the right direction, as my experience with Kinetix systems is limited. Any insights or alternative viewpoints would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Looking to optimize energy consumption at the end of a cycle? Consider this resource from Rockwell Automation for a more efficient solution: https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/in/2198-in004_-en-p.pdf. This option helps maintain cooler temperatures and could potentially save you money in the long run. While the payback period may be lengthy (around 100 years), it is a sophisticated and effective choice for energy management. Keith</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why is the internal shunt resistor in the Kinetix 5500 not sufficient for two-axis motion involving Joint 1 and Joint 2?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The internal shunt resistor in the Kinetix 5500 may not be adequate for applications involving significant braking and increased speeds, particularly when running a robot with two axes of motion such as Joint 1 and Joint 2.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  What is the short-term solution mentioned in the discussion thread for managing the issue with the internal shunt resistor?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The short-term solution proposed in the thread is to temporarily raise the thermal threshold to 120-130% to address the inadequate internal shunt resistor. This is a temporary measure to manage the situation for a short period of time (2 days).</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How does the external resistor 2097-R6 offer a long-term solution for the Kinetix 5500 drive unit?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The external resistor 2097-R6 provides a long-term solution by offering a higher power rating (up to 150W) compared to the stock internal resistor (rated at 50W). By installing the external resistor, the system can better handle the demands of prolonged operation at high speeds without relying solely on the internal shunt resistor.</p>
