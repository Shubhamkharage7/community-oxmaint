                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>It's been a while since I last checked in. I wanted to ask a question about my small sand blasting facility that is linked to our powder coating operation, equipped with a Van Air Systems Model RA-250 Air Dryer. I am unsure of how old this equipment is, and I fear it may start causing issues soon. I recently ordered two Solenoid Drain valves for maintenance. The unit is currently skid mounted, but we will be relocating our facility soon. Considering the unknown age of the Air Dryer, I am contemplating investing in a new unit of similar quality. Any recommendations or suggestions from those familiar with this equipment? Thank you for your input.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The air dryer features a twin tower regenerative unit, after cooler, moisture trap, oil separator, and automatic drains. Currently, I am in the process of replacing the auto drain valves and filter. However, minimal maintenance has been conducted, and I am concerned that I may end up spending more on maintenance than required. Therefore, I am considering investing in a new air dryer unit for optimal performance and cost-efficiency.</p>

            <p>Bill, are you experiencing issues with your air dryer related to moisture problems? The only moving components in this equipment are the stems of the solenoid valves. Can you provide details on the type of desiccant you have inside?</p>

            <p>Hello Steven, I haven't received any reports of moisture issues. The dessicant being used is activated alumina. I recently received an update from the Drain Valve supplier stating that the new drain valves will arrive next week. I plan to install them and conduct some routine cleaning and maintenance to assess any improvements. Thank you for your message. I have found this forum to be a valuable resource. Have a great day!</p>
