            <p>After 40 years of commissioning h/w from top brands like RA, Siemens, IFM, Keyence, Cognex, Festo, Fanuc, ABB, and Nachi, I have yet to require a tool like this.</p>

            <p>This versatile tool is perfect for Ethernet Network configuration, especially within ControlLogix modules. While USB is now more commonly used, setting octet 4 with switches can be highly beneficial. It's particularly handy for setting IPs on Micro 820 devices. Being able to read unknown IPs is a major plus. Although I have mainly used it with L8xE modules, I believe it can work with any module. I purchased mine from GIT, although it originates from TW.</p>

            <p>I have personally used the device sold by TW Controls and found it to be highly beneficial. One key feature that stands out to me is the Read Unknown function, which allows me to easily connect it to an ethernet network and identify and read information from every connected device. This tool not only provides me with the manufacturer and part number of the devices, but also offers firmware revision details for Rockwell products. It is particularly useful in situations where troubleshooting a PLC with limited documentation is necessary.

Furthermore, I find this device handy for configuring IP addresses on VFDs, especially when manufacturers place important information on stickers located in hard-to-reach areas. With this tool, I can quickly connect to a drive and set its IP address accurately without the need to gather MAC addresses beforehand.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, using software like Bootp or Wireshark can be challenging compared to the ease of using Ethernet/IP once you grasp its capabilities. Setting it up for specific tasks can make finding or changing an IP address in just a minute possible, or configuring an IP for a new component straight out of the box. Keep in mind that not all devices are compatible with Ethernet/IP, so it's important to understand its limitations. However, it's still a valuable tool that can complement other networking tools in your toolkit.</p>

            <p>I am particularly interested in scenarios where I am dispatched remotely for a FAT or FCO, dealing with numerous devices requiring IP addresses but lacking a pre-established network for bootp configuration. During my recent assignment at an FCO, I spent two days manually assigning IP addresses to E300 smart bucket controllers by connecting a laptop. In retrospect, utilizing a handheld device would have been a more efficient approach than struggling with bootp setup on the E300.

According to geniusintraining, customers have been satisfied with the handheld device, as it simplifies the process compared to the cumbersome BootP method. Additionally, there is a 60-day money-back guarantee for dissatisfied customers. Tim has produced helpful instructional videos, and the manufacturer/designer has implemented notable improvements.

I have encountered difficulties setting the E300 IP address through Linx in the past, typically resorting to web page configuration. However, I now have an E300 available for testing to explore potential uses of Linx for IP configuration. My assumption is that the handheld device sets the IP using the ENET CIP object, and I am optimistic that it also supports the TCP/IP CIP object for newer devices.</p>

Regarding the E300s, we are uncertain about its capabilities with the new Profinet support. Can it also assign the IP to an S7? Let's explore this further to understand its full potential.</p>

            <p>Below, you can find information about the capabilities of the current firmware for modern Logix controllers and modules. The E300 model was introduced in 2017, with Profinet support added in 2022 and GigECam support implemented in late 2023. 

Specifically for the E300 firmware version 6.xxx, we extensively utilized the address increment feature when commissioning over 30 E300 units. This feature proved to be essential for efficient operations. 

For contemporary PLCs, the firmware supports dual IP and DLR on CompactLogix, as well as multiple ports on the L5480 model. In terms of compatibility, we conducted tests with S7-300, S7-1200, and S7-1500 models for the S7 series.</p>

            <p>geniusintraining mentioned that the current firmware is capable of supporting all modern Logix controllers and modules, with E300 compatibility being added in 2017. Profinet support was introduced in 2022, followed by GigECam support in late 2023. An important detail to note is the extensive use of E300 FW 6.xxx, particularly the addition of address increment when commissioning over 30 E300 units, recognizing its necessity.

For contemporary PLCs, it offers dual IP and DLR capabilities on CompactLogix, as well as multiple ports on L5480. Compatibility has been tested with S7-300, S7-1200, and S7-1500 for Siemens S7 systems.
