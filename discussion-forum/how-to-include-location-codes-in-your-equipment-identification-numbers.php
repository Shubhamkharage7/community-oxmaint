            <p>Certainly! We have utilized the Location field in the equipment master to denote different plant operating units. This allows users to easily search for work orders within a specific unit by entering values in the Location field during their selection process. Additionally, do you also input other information such as date installed, initial price, and more?</p>

            <p>Back when we were dealing with our older equipment and plant, we had a well-thought-out numbering system in place. While we didn't have the convenience of a CMMS at that time, we made do with tables in Paradox and some creative thinking. Looking back, I now realize that our system was indeed very logical - much like the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) for FORD vehicles. When we constructed an oil refinery, we applied this numbering system to the PFD's and P&ID's, complete with area codes for easy identification. Thanks to advancements in CMMS technology, creating equipment and system hierarchies for various purposes has become a breeze. Ensuring that the installation date is included is crucial, as CMMS systems rely on this information. Additionally, valuable insights such as pricing and cost centers can be effortlessly accessed through the purchasing history and CMMS records.</p>

            <p>A strategic approach to equipment numbering incorporating location codes can be beneficial for static equipment setups. However, it may not be ideal for mobile equipment. I have provided a detailed equipment coding and numbering system that I developed previously, which you may find useful. Download the document titled "Data Formatting and Naming Convention" for more information.</p>

            <p>Josh inquired if other data such as date installed and initial price are also populated. Yes, we utilize the location code and various other fields found in the SAP R/3 equipment master record. The location code is part of the equipment ID number, as explained by Svanels and Brian. For instance, the third Air Handling Unit installed in building 150 would have the equipment ID 150AHU003. Brian brought up the next question regarding how to manage portable or fixed equipment that may be relocated. In one plant, a logical numbering system was used where the location code "900" denoted "portable." For relocation cases, the original equipment number was deactivated and a new one was assigned with the new location code. A note was added in the CMMS and physical equipment history record to reference the old record number for previous equipment history. Are there any alternative solutions available?</p>

            <p>Eugene, you highlighted a common issue faced in CMMS systems regarding the inclusion of physical locations in identification codes. While it may seem beneficial initially, it can lead to confusion and inefficiency in the long run. Avoiding the inclusion of physical locations in ID codes can prevent future users from struggling to understand how equipment was categorized in the past. It's important to steer clear of reincarnating existing equipment and being bound by outdated practices.</p>

            <p>It is important not to solely rely on memory; always write down and cross-reference records. Utilize the custom field in the CMMS equipment master record by adding notes such as "Previous ID 010AHU012" during the reborn process and "New ID 150AHU003" when changing the equipment status to "Inactive". Additionally, keep a copy of the "death certificate" of the previous equipment in the hardcopy history record for reference.

In certain industries, changes in CMMS records require documented approval before being implemented. For those not following this procedure, a print screen of the inactivated record may suffice. Also, ensure to document the reinstallation of the equipment in a new location with its new equipment ID number in the hardcopy history record. Before all these steps, confirm that the equipment is truly back in operation and not a "zombie" or "mummy" that should have remained inactive.</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene, we have implemented a system that closely aligns with the structure you outlined for your "fixed" equipment items. For instance, each item is identified by a specific code that includes information such as the facility number, process area, and equipment type (e.g. 91PMP1234 = facility #9, Process area #1, pump #1234). In contrast, rotating assets such as motors, lift trucks, and portable pumps are assigned a distinct "rotable" number like MTR-9876. These rotables are linked to a parent code, such as 91PMP1234, or other relevant grouping. This organized approach enhances tracking and management of equipment throughout the facility.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Our fixed equipment structure follows a specific format: .P-106 = site (TLF), where P represents the pump and 1 denotes the process unit with a sequential number. This format is derived from existing Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and does not include physical location details, focusing on the core of the subject. While it is essential for a competent CMMS to have a location field, the key question is the benefits it brings. It is crucial for operational, maintenance, engineering, and reliability teams to easily locate assets. For example, using the location field to identify the owner or department of an asset allows for efficient grouping and analysis based on numerical accounts. This could be particularly useful for tracking maintenance expenses, such as how much was spent on air conditioning for the Sales Department during summer months, enabling better decision-making.</p>
