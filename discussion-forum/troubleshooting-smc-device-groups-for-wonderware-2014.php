                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am encountering an issue with SMC not updating my device groups. I am utilizing the OI-ABCIP server, which has been reliable for WW 2014. However, on this new computer I am configuring, it is not recognizing the device names. I have replicated the setup from the previous computer, including the same device names, yet SMC is not acknowledging these device groups. The log viewer has not provided any useful information, as there are no indications of connection issues. I may have overlooked something at this point. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

The log viewer does not show any yellow or red messages, but there is an error related to WWSL.DLL not loading. This DLL is essential for SuiteLink, Wonderware's connection protocol. The failure to load WWSL.DLL is likely the root cause of the issue. Can you provide more details about the error message?</p>

            <p>I've never encountered this problem before, but after doing a Google search, I came across a mention of a hotfix for the WWSL.DLL file dating back over a decade. If you downloaded your installation files after that time, it's likely that the hotfix is already included. You could try repairing or reinstalling the software to see if that resolves the issue. Best of luck with fixing it!</p>

            <p>I encountered a challenging issue on Reddit recently and I am still puzzled by it. I discovered the importance of clearing the cache regularly, particularly when making changes online. While I don't believe the issue lies with you, it may be beneficial to check for and clear cache files to determine if the OI server detects the PLC. For more information on this issue and additional troubleshooting ideas, you can refer to the thread titled "Wonderware Intouch - Power outage and UploadTags Retriggered messages."</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response! I have reviewed the article you mentioned, but unfortunately, I am unable to make online edits. Despite running the slsping <host name> <application name>, the system is not recognizing view, DASABCIP, ABCIP as active processes even when they are in operation. I attempted to address this issue by applying the hot fix with the updated WWSL.DLL file, but it did not yield any improvements, which was disappointing. Additionally, I uninstalled the entire WW2014 program and SMC before reinstalling them, but the problem persisted. At this point, I am unsure of the next steps to take, aside from possibly considering a NAD as a troubleshooting measure.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is SMC not updating my device groups for Wonderware 2014?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - SMC may not be recognizing the device names due to a configuration issue on the new computer. Double-check that the setup has been replicated correctly, including the device names.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What could be causing SMC to not acknowledge the device groups?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The issue of SMC not acknowledging device groups could be related to misconfigured settings or setup inconsistencies. Ensure that all configurations are correctly replicated from the previous computer.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How can I troubleshoot SMC device group recognition issues in Wonderware 2014?</h4>
