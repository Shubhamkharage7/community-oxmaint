                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello there! Our website features a 10-ton overhead crane with an emergency braking system that was originally designed to operate in the event of an electrical power failure. However, for reasons unknown to us, this system was disabled twenty years ago. We are now looking to restore it, but unfortunately, we do not have the specifications for it. Can anyone provide guidance on where I can find this information?</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues with your emergency brake circuit, it's best to contact the manufacturer first. They have expert knowledge of the circuit's parameters and can provide the best guidance for troubleshooting. Remember to consult the manufacturer for any technical support related to your emergency brake system.</p>
