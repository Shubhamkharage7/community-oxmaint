                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I would like to revisit a topic that has been discussed both here and across the internet. When looking at a breaker, red typically indicates that it is closed, while green indicates that it is open or tripped. This color coding is based on the concept of red symbolizing danger because a closed breaker means it is energized, which is potentially hazardous. 

Although this color scheme is widely used in the field, my main customer has a different standard where green represents a closed breaker and running motor. While this system works for them, it can be confusing for others who are accustomed to the traditional color coding.

I am currently working on a project for a new company where the color scheme for alarm lights is inconsistent and confusing. I plan to simplify the design by eliminating "alarm" colors and using a black/grey/white palette. This will help operators easily identify the status of equipment without having to decipher complex color schemes.

For example, I am considering using black for closed breakers, white for open breakers, and grey for status discrepancies. I may also include text indicators like "TRIP" or "CLOSED" next to the breaker symbols for clarity. Additionally, I am exploring options for representing motors and valves with text labels.

Overall, I am seeking suggestions and ideas to streamline the visualization of equipment status on the interface. Your input is appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I highly appreciate your suggestion to "Add a box next to it with text TRIP / CLOSED?" I recently learned that color-coded HMIs can be challenging for color blind employees, as statistics show that around 10% of males and a smaller percentage of females are color blind to some extent. Different companies have varying standards for interpreting colors. For example, at a previous workplace, Red was used to indicate closed valves, which was confusing to me as I always associated Red with alarms or faults. However, the rest of the team was accustomed to this color scheme. It is important to consider the impact of color blindness on design choices.

            <p>I firmly believe that the HMI is crucial for identifying obstacles in the process or sequence, as it highlights them in red. However, it is concerning that there is a discrepancy in the color coding on the breaker. To address this issue, I suggest adding a note on the HMI stating that a green position on the breaker signifies disconnection, while red indicates connection - opposite of the HMI status display. As a solution, I have started using a red X to signify any hindrances in the process, which is also beneficial for individuals with color blindness. This approach enhances clarity and efficiency in operations.</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, JesperMP brought up the confusion surrounding the term "closed" in reference to letting energy through. This terminology can be counterintuitive for those unfamiliar with its meaning. This confusion is why JesperMP's main customer prefers to use "Closed/Tripped" instead of "Closed/Open" for breakers. This ensures that "Tripped" specifically indicates "de-energized," making "Closed" the obvious opposite. While the reason for this choice is unclear, it often leads to misunderstandings, especially among newcomers. This miscommunication can potentially result in dangerous situations, emphasizing the importance of clear and consistent terminology in the electrical industry.</p>

            <p>When it comes to displaying circuit breaker status on my Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), I typically opt to show the power status instead. Typically, green indicates the power is on, while red signifies it is off. However, for motors, red may indicate a fault, while grey, dim blue, or dim green all signal the power is off. Bright lime green indicates the power is on. Additionally, I have always disagreed with using red to indicate that a circuit breaker is on, as this is not a standard practice for other components.</p>

            <p>After experimenting with different approaches, I came to realize that human understanding of facial expressions is generally universal. Therefore, I incorporate colors to visually indicate the status of various situations. For instance, I use a green happy face for things that are working correctly, orange annoyed faces for issues, red sad faces for major problems, and grey neutral faces for ambiguities. While words can be useful, they may need to be translated for non-English speaking users or machines. 

I could expand on this concept by including visual cues for: individuals who skip training, those who blame system malfunctions on external factors, and the end of each shift. For example, I recall a colleague using happy turkeys on a screen to signify when a turkey plucking machine is functioning efficiently.</p>

            <p>After reading a whitepaper from ABB, I learned that a recommended approach for HMI design is to use color, specifically red, to highlight disturbances while keeping the rest of the display in grayscale. This helps to quickly identify issues without overwhelming users with multiple colors and distractions, minimizing information fatigue during regular operation. The key idea is to streamline the visual cues for efficient troubleshooting and operation.</p>

            <p>According to I_Automation, in the world of industrial automation, the color green typically signifies "On" or "Powered Up," while red commonly signifies "Off." This color-coding system is crucial for operators to quickly understand the status of machinery and processes. For example, I recall working at a power station where the entire Distributed Control System (DCS) was programmed with the rule that red meant danger and green meant stopped. It was initially disconcerting to see the operator faced with a screen filled with red symbols, indicating that everything was actually running smoothly.</p>

            <p>Puddle recounted an interesting experience working at a power station where the entire DCS was programmed with the rule that red signifies danger and green means stopped. It was initially odd to see the operator facing a screen filled with red symbols indicating everything was running smoothly. Just like how you wouldn't run a red traffic light, red indicates stopped or fault, while green means go. The concept of "less is more" applies here, where using fewer colors can actually be more informative. This allows for clear indication of faults with just one color (whether it's green, red, or blue).

            <p>In a recent whitepaper, possibly from ABB, it was suggested that HMIs should only highlight disturbances in color, preferably red, while the rest should be kept in grayscale. This approach ensures quick identification of issues without overwhelming users with excessive colors and distractions during normal operation. I concur that using a limited color palette is less confusing and more effective.

I adhere to a similar principle when designing HMIs, using colors like green to indicate GO or RUNNING and red for STOP or FAULTED. Additionally, I always include a designated fault screen or message box to provide a detailed explanation of the issue. It seems like there is a consensus on this approach, as mentioned by mad4X4 above.</p>

            <p>In my previous experience working with pharmaceutical clients, it was common practice for HMI designs to accommodate color blind employees by including text indicators along with color cues. I have since implemented this practice with other clients as well. In my current workplace, I have noticed that many individuals solely rely on color cues, however, I have yet to encounter anyone who is unable to differentiate between green and red. The higher-ups appreciate the inclusivity of incorporating text indicators, as it requires minimal extra effort on my part. When it comes to using red and green indicators, I have seen both approaches utilized. Personally, I prefer having a green overview screen to indicate when operations are running smoothly, and red for when there are issues. Adding text alongside the indicators helps to eliminate any potential confusion.</p>

            <p>According to creativepaper, my previous pharmaceutical clients insisted on HMI designs that accommodated color blind employees. This meant including text alongside color indicators. Surprisingly, my clients in the Detroit area have a significant portion of non-literate employees, about 20%, operating machines. These clients prefer minimal to no text on HMIs, entrusting non-literate employees with machine operation. Additionally, two clients with foreign ownership have 75% of their employees unable to read English, requiring notices in multiple languages and frequent translation assistance. This raises concerns about the safety and efficiency of operations.</p>

            <p>Recently, we completed a SCADA system design adhering to a specific style guide. This guide designated normal running conditions as white, inactive status as grey, manual control as yellow, and faults as red. One of the requirements included removing all branding and graphic elements from the interface. While I wasn't particularly fond of this approach, I did recognize its importance. The reasoning behind using white for running conditions is to minimize distractions for operators who spend extended periods monitoring SCADA displays. By reducing unnecessary stimuli, we help prevent operator fatigue and ensure their attention remains focused on crucial information.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is red traditionally used to indicate a closed breaker and green to indicate an open or tripped breaker?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Red is commonly associated with danger, making it a suitable color choice for closed breakers that are energized and potentially hazardous. Green, on the other hand, is often used to signify safety or normal operation, hence its association with open or tripped breakers.</p>
</div>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can I simplify the color coding for breaker status in my HMI interface?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - One approach to simplifying the color scheme is to use a palette of black, white, and grey. For example, using black for closed breakers, white for open breakers, and grey for status discrepancies can help operators easily identify the status of equipment without confusion.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What are some additional visual indicators that can enhance equipment status visualization on the interface?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - In addition to color coding, incorporating text indicators like "TRIP" or "CLOSED" next to breaker symbols can provide clarity. Exploring options for representing motors and valves with text labels can also further streamline the visualization of equipment status on the interface.</p>
