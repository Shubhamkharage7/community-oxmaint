            <p>If you're looking to purchase the standard package, consider opting for the annual subscription. However, you also have the option to negotiate with your distributor for a permanent license. For example, when I purchased my S5k Full Edition a couple of years ago, it cost me $5,200.</p>

            <p>In an era where many software companies are moving towards the subscription model, Rockwell is also embracing this trend. Why settle for selling a customer an app for a one-time fee and have no further interaction when you can instead have them pay you annually? If you prefer a "perpetual" license, it's important to note that Rockwell may eventually phase out this option. To learn more about the differences between perpetual and subscription versions of Studio 5000, check out this informative link: Studio 5000 – Pricing, Packages, Features & Bundles.

            <p>When selling software products like Studio 5000 Standard + Legacy version 9324-RLD300ENE, it is crucial to transfer ownership to the buyer through Rockwell. This will ensure that the new owner can utilize the software without any issues. Don't forget to specify the price of your software as well. Contacting Rockwell to transfer ownership is essential for a smooth transition of the software to the new user.</p>

            <p>I recently checked and found that I currently have 16 active Rockwell licenses. These licenses are permanent, however, it is important to note that I have accumulated them over a span of at least 30 years. To ensure their continued activation, I am required to maintain an annual Techconnect contract which allows me to access updates, upgrades, and technical support. It is crucial to keep your software up to date, especially if you are actively working in the field. In the past, I learned the hard way when I had to pay a premium to reinstate my license after failing to upgrade with a new PLC version release. With the release of Studo5000, I was prepared as I already had Logix5000 and an active Techconnect contract, allowing me to easily download the update. When considering your options, it is recommended to consult with your distributor to discuss the available choices and pricing. While you have the option to sell or transfer permanent licenses, the buyer will need to purchase a Techconnect contract to access upgrades and the current version. Ultimately, you must evaluate your circumstances and choose the best course of action. As I contemplate my future plans, I am considering transferring these licenses to a relative who is entering the field of programming. It is valuable to consider the worth of these licenses now and make a decision accordingly.</p>
