                    <p>I am currently facing an issue with my 1769-L24ER Q1B1 Series B controller, which is only compatible with programs from version 30.00 and up.

I have tried changing the controller type in the properties to version 30, but Logix Designer displays an error message with an invalid file path. Is there another method to open the program on version 30 without encountering this issue? Thank you for any assistance provided!</p>

            <p>The success of accessing this file may vary depending on the location you are trying to open it from. I have encountered difficulties when trying to open files that are not stored directly on my computer - files located on a network drive or remote media can sometimes have issues with converting. It is recommended to save the file to your desktop or a local location before trying to open it again to avoid any potential complications.</p>

            <p>Androcci expressed gratitude for the assistance regarding converting a program from version 20 to version 30 on different platforms. Transitioning from RSLogix 5000 to Studio 5000 involves changing the processor and version. If issues persist, attempting a conversion to versions 21 or 22 may help identify the root cause of the problem. Any ideas on how to kickstart the conversion process?</p>

            <p>When upgrading the processor version, the software undergoes a few changes. Initially, your current application is renamed to reflect the new version, such as renaming "Conveyor.ACD" to "Conveyor.ACD_V20". Subsequently, a new file is created for version 30 under the original file's location, seemingly appearing as the same file but actually a fresh iteration. If encountering issues with file creation, error messages may provide insights, particularly if the file or folder is set as Read Only. Identifying and addressing such errors can help resolve any hindrances to creating the new file.</p>

            <p>Arpus4KM mentioned that transitioning from RSLogix 5000 to Studio 5000 is a simple process of changing the processor and version. However, encountering other issues may arise. It is suggested to upgrade from version 20 to versions 21 or 22 to troubleshoot the problem.

Personally, I find it strange that when I modify the controller type in RSLogix5000, I am only presented with versions 20, 30, and 32. When switching from controller type 20.04 to version 30, Studio 5000 launches but an error message appears. Please refer to the attached screenshot for further clarification.</p>

            <p>An issue arises when changing the controller type in RSLogix5000, as only versions 20, 30, and 32 are available. An error occurs when attempting to switch from version 20.04 to version 30, prompting Studio 5000 to open with a message stating the file is currently in use by another process. To address this, it is recommended to start afresh by retrieving the original V20 file, giving it a new name, and restarting the computer to clear any cached data. Store the file in a desktop folder to avoid permission complications and then attempt to convert the newly named file. This approach may resolve the issue at hand.</p>

            <p>Operaghost explained that changing the processor version is a simple task, but there are a few important steps involved in the process. The software will rename your current application, such as changing "Conveyor.ACD" to "Conveyor.ACD_V20", and create a new file for version 30 named "Conveyor.ACD" in the same location. Despite appearing the same to the user, it is actually a completely new file. If you encounter any errors during this process, it could be due to the file location settings, such as Read Only permissions, or admin access issues. This is a common issue when trying to open or work with files that are not stored locally in Studio. It's important to ensure that Studio can handle working with files from different locations to avoid any complications. By checking for error messages and adjusting file permissions, you can resolve any issues that may arise.</p>

            <p>After troubleshooting, I discovered a solution to the issue by changing the controller type in Studio 5000. Now, I simply keep my finger on the "End Task" button in Task Manager, and as soon as Rslogix 5000 pops up in my menu bar, I end the task. It may seem a bit unconventional, but it effectively resolves the error I encountered.</p>

            <p>Androcci pointed out a strange issue with changing the controller type in rslogix5000. When switching from version 20.04 to version 30, Studio 5000 opens with an error message. The only versions available are ver 20, ver 30, and ver 32. A screenshot of the error is attached below. The problem may be due to the file path being over 128 characters long.

            <p>I encountered a similar issue due to lack of Administrator rights. To resolve it, locate the Launcher and v30 Designer programs (along with any other installed versions). Access the Properties/Compatibility settings for both programs and set them to Run As Administrator. I recommend adjusting the compatibility settings for all users. The project is typically saved in your User folder, and V30 may require admin rights to access it. The In-Use popup error could be a common issue when a file cannot be opened. I have faced similar difficulties with other software, such as A-D DirectSoft.</p>
