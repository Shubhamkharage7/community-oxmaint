                    <p>Greetings everyone, I am a new member of this forum and am impressed by its interactivity and wealth of information. I am currently overseeing a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) program for a gas plant and am seeking advice on the essential requirements in SAP PM for collecting RCM data. So far, I have identified two prerequisites: maintaining a Catalogue profile and utilizing a downtime indicator. Can anyone suggest additional prerequisites for this process? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Nilesh, the question you raised is quite intriguing. In order to generate a reliable report on reliability, besides the Downtime indicator and Catalogue profile, there are several additional components that need to be set up. SAP offers a partner product from Meridium, which is seamlessly integrated with SAP's PM & BW modules. The attached presentation was recently presented at the Mastering SAP PM event in Australia, providing essential steps and processes for a successful RCM project. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you require further assistance. Regards.</p>

            <p>Dear Bob, I've completed the second presentation, but unfortunately, the first part seems to be corrupted. Currently, we are not in the market for a software-based RCM solution. Our plan is to integrate RCM using our existing CMMS (SAP PM), and most of the initial work will be done manually on paper. I reviewed the presentation you sent and I'm having trouble understanding the necessary updates and checks required in SAP PM for RCM data integration. During a recent meeting, I was informed that grouping technical objects is crucial for generating accurate MTTR/MTBF reports in SAP, but the reason behind this was not explained. It's crucial for me to understand these requirements in order for our pilot RCM project to be successful. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>When considering CMMS/EAM programs, it is important to proceed with caution as many software systems may not be fully populated or set up correctly. Despite vendor promises of these programs providing all necessary information, this is often not the case in reality. I have attached a brief essay from my ongoing series on the future of workforce and communication in maintenance management. A key factor in successful implementation is to involve input from the technicians and operators of the equipment. Best regards, Howard.</p>

            <p>Hello Nilesh, I apologize for any confusion caused. The presentation I sent was not meant to promote a specific software, but rather to illustrate the process flow. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of the overall process you wish to establish, starting from the RCM evaluation setup to analyzing the impacts and benefits of its implementation.

It is advisable, as MotorDoc suggested, to involve operators and maintainers in creating these processes utilizing the support system. Whether you choose an EAM solution from SAP or ABC should not be a deciding factor. However, I may not agree with some points mentioned in the "corporate communication". Many failures of COTS-based CMMS/EAM systems occur due to misunderstandings. These systems are merely tools developed by technology experts based on customer requirements.

If the processes within some companies are not properly aligned, a CMMS may not be effective. Feel free to email me at bvental@yahoo.com for the attachments, as they are too large to upload here. Thank you, Bob.</p>

            <p>We appreciate everyone's support as we move forward with incorporating maintenance technicians and operators in our Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) deployment plans. We are closely following the RCM2 methodology recommended by John M. In our research, we have reviewed the SAE JA1011 and SAE JA1012 standards, which bear similarities to RCM2, with the main difference being the decision diagrams. Unlike SAE, RCM2 does provide decision diagrams for guidance. As we prepare for RCM implementation, we are evaluating our readiness and looking into any necessary adjustments in SAP to ensure accurate input data for RCM analysis, including MMTR, MTBF, repair costs, asset history, and more. We also acknowledge the challenges highlighted in the insights shared by MotorDoc regarding the disconnect between CMMS and RCM requirements in the industry.</p>

            <p>It's great that you've confirmed we're discussing the standard RCM process. While I'm not an RCM expert, I do have experience with SAP PM. I'm curious about the specific raw data needed for RCM input, such as MMTR and MTBF calculations. I know there's a need for data filtering, and repair costs can be tracked through work orders. Could you clarify what is meant by "asset technical history"? By clearly stating the required raw data for RCM, the CMMS community may be able to better meet your RCM needs and bridge any existing gaps.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure the effectiveness of your CMMS, it is crucial to establish a solid maintenance work process and adhere to it consistently. Neglecting to follow the data collection and storage process can be more detrimental than not having any system in place at all. The term "asset technical history" can refer to equipment specifications in the equipment record or the maintenance and repair history recorded in notifications. For instance, Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) can be tracked by entering the Malfunction Start and End date/time in the Malfunction Report or Activity Report under the Malfunction Data tab. To calculate Mean Time Between Repairs (MTBR) or Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), you can utilize the Breakdown box on the same report. The Items tab on the report can help monitor failing parts, causes of malfunction, and actions taken. Retrieving this data for analysis may not be as straightforward as inputting it. While SAP PM offers standard reports, they may require specific database configurations to function correctly. Utilizing SAP BW (Business Warehouse) and knowledgeable personnel can help create customized reports by extracting data and integrating it with other sources. Remember, databases are valuable tools, but the insights of engineers, operators, mechanics, and technicians are essential for a comprehensive RCM analysis. They hold valuable information on how systems operate on a daily basis. Whether implementing RCM for new equipment/processes or optimizing existing systems/plants, prioritizing input from these individuals is crucial for a successful RCM program. Best of luck with your RCM endeavors!</p>

            <p>Greetings Nilesh,

I am Kevin Sutherland, a Solutions Engineer at Meridium located in Roanoke, Virginia. I see that you have received positive feedback on our RCMO product from your initial request, which included slides provided by BobV. It is crucial to establish a solid CMMS foundation, conduct asset assessments to identify high-risk assets, select an appropriate RCM/FMEA methodology based on asset risk, and involve a diverse group of Subject Matter Experts in each analysis. At Meridium, we emphasize the significance of following these steps diligently. 

Our RCMO product was designed with three key objectives in mind:

1. Effective implementation of RCM/FMEA outcomes into your CMMS (such as SAP) is essential for successful results.
2. Organizations investing in RCM initiatives seek a clear understanding of the returns on their investment.
3. Maintenance strategies need to evolve alongside the dynamic nature of plant environments, as opposed to being treated as one-off exercises.

If you require any assistance with your RCM projects, feel free to reach out to me at ksutherland@meridium.com. 

Best regards,
Kevin Sutherland
