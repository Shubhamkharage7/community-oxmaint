                    <p>Are you searching for the best formula in Excel to determine the first stoppage after a PM job, using raised by dates and coded columns? Any helpful examples would be appreciated. I often spend a significant amount of time trying to find the most effective formula to display the initial workorder with a BK code following the closure of a PM workorder. Tracking the reasons for failure after servicing is crucial for improving work quality in the field of reliability.</p>

            <p>What is a BK code and does it signify a breakdown? I'm a bit confused by your question â€“ perhaps you could provide some clarification. Are you trying to determine the initial work order with the breakdown code marked as complete? Is my interpretation accurate?</p>

            <p>I am currently exploring ways to utilize Excel for identifying the initial issue following a scheduled PM service. Does anyone else employ this approach and could provide a sample of the formulas utilized in Excel for this purpose? Currently, I export the data to a spreadsheet but aim to streamline the process with a formula. I am curious about alternative methodologies in use.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Apologies for the confusion! In the system, different codes are used to indicate various types of work orders, such as Breakdown (Bk), Accident Damage (AD), Planned (PL), Warranty (WR), and System Generated (SG). 

If we have a list of work orders sorted by date, I am looking to have another cell in the same row but a different column display the first Breakdown (Bk) work order that occurs in date sequence after every Planned (PL) or System Generated (SG) type. For example, if an underground Haulage truck returns to work after leaving the workshop and then requires repairs for loss of power 20 hours later, the new column will show the header for the loss of power work order following the PM service. 

I hope this explanation clarifies things. Thank you! - Dusted.</p>

            <p>Hello Dusted, 

I have attached an Excel file containing data for 50 events, with codes in column B and dates in column C. This should meet your requirements. If not, please let me know so I can make any necessary adjustments. The spreadsheet includes an example with 20 events already filled in. The time intervals in column D are automatically calculated for the BK-PL events. Columns G and H are for additional calculations and can be hidden during regular use. If you are satisfied with this solution, the coding in columns D, G, and H can be expanded to cover a longer time period. 

I hope this information is helpful. 

Best regards, 
Rui

            <p>Hello Rui, I am looking to enhance my spreadsheet by adding columns for work order number, work order description, and Equipment Reference. With an average of 700-1000 work orders per month across 4 major workgroups due to the significant amount of equipment we have, I want to ensure that your formulas remain intact when I input my data. Additionally, I plan to analyze historical data to establish trends for FSAPM (first stoppage after PM), with approximately 16,000 work orders in our database. Thank you for your assistance.

            <p>Hello Dusted, You have the flexibility to add as many additional columns as needed, but make sure not to insert them between columns G and H. It is important to keep these two columns together to avoid having to manually adjust formulas in column D. However, you can easily move them to a different location within the spreadsheet or even to a new sheet. Any other modifications made to the spreadsheet will automatically adjust the formulas accordingly. Unfortunately, the spreadsheet shared in your previous post is password-protected and cannot be accessed. Please feel free to ask any further questions. Best regards, Rui.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. How can I use Excel to find the first stoppage after a PM job based on dates and codes?
- You can achieve this by utilizing Excel formulas to search for the initial workorder with a specific code following the closure of a PM workorder. 
   
2. Can you provide an example of an Excel formula for identifying the first stoppage after a PM job?
- Certainly! One way to do this is by using a combination of functions like INDEX, MATCH, and IF to locate the first occurrence of a specific code after a PM job's completion date.
   
3. Why is it important to track the reasons for failure following servicing in the field of reliability?
- Tracking stoppages and failure reasons after PM jobs is vital for improving work quality and reliability in the field. It helps in identifying trends, addressing recurring issues, and enhancing overall maintenance processes.
   
4. How can Excel formulas assist in improving work quality by tracking stoppages after PM jobs?
- Excel formulas can streamline the process of identifying and analyzing stoppages after PM jobs. By automating the search for specific codes and dates, it saves time and provides valuable insights for continuous improvement in work quality and reliability.</p>
