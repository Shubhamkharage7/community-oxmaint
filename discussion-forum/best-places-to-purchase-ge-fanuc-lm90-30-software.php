            <p>As mentioned by others, there is no need to purchase LM90-30 software as it can be easily downloaded from the GE Fanuc support website. However, it is important to consider why LM90 is being used despite being an outdated, DOS-based system. While it may still be possible to run and communicate with your PLC using the latest Microsoft operating systems, issues may arise.

If you are looking to make a purchase, consider investing in Cimplicity Machine Edition Logic Developer PLC, part number IC646MPS001, with a list price of $800 US. This software requires a computer with at least a 500 mHz pentium-class CPU and 128 meg of RAM (although they recommend 1 GHz and 256 meg). Alternatively, you can opt for VersaPro, part number IC641VPS300, also priced at $800 US. Keep in mind that salespeople tend to promote CME due to its long-term support for future products. It is advisable to choose a package based on your computer's capabilities, as newer products will only be supported by CME.

If you are located in Barbados or the Caribbean Islands and seeking to purchase GE products, contact the Miami sales office of GE Industrial Systems at 1-305-551-5177 or fax them at 1-305-551-5129.</p>

            <p>One common issue I encountered is that the processor firmware on the Versa-Pro may not be compatible. I'm unsure if the processor is capable of being upgraded in the field. When this occurred for me, I didn't have the time to troubleshoot it, so I opted to use LM instead.</p>

            <p>What makes LM90 the perfect choice? It's cost-effective, compatible with all Windows versions, and far superior to the now outdated VersaPro. Plus, LM90 doesn't require high-end hardware - it can run smoothly on any machine, from a 386 to a P4. And the best part? It's completely free!</p>

            <p>Rick, the issue of compatibility between VersaPro (VP) and firmware revision levels is significant. Older firmware versions may stop executing the program when accessing fault tables in certain conditions. This can be the most serious problem, although there may be other issues to consider.

VersaPro offers options to prevent downloading to outdated firmware versions by default, warn users about attempting to download to older versions, or unconditionally allow the download.

In retrospect, there is a case study waiting to be written on how not to manage software at the University of Virginia School of Management. The transition from the fine DOS software LM90 to VersaPro was not executed well by GE Fanuc, as it was delayed and eventually mismanaged. Especially with VersaPro being considered too little, too late, it is evident that CME has the potential to be a great package but is currently a resource-intensive application.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick response! We require the LM90-30 for an upcoming GE Fanuc PLC training course, as our machines are powered by the GE Fanuc Series 90-30. The program documentation we have is specifically for the LM90-30. Thank you all once again!

            <p>The DEMO version, lm9030d.zip, is fully functional with a size limit of 750 bytes for _MAIN and 750 bytes per program block. To run LM90-30/20/Micro from a disk without the software, set up the $PLCROOT environment variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT to specify the location of the LM90 software. The 9.05 Special 1 and 2 versions are mainly designed to address download issues. Although I currently use VersaPro more frequently, I still have access to LM90 when needed.</p>

            <p>Bernie, I recently downloaded lm9030d.zip and installed it on an extra hard drive I had on hand. The installation creates a directory named LM90demo and it is launched using lm90demo.bat. A typical installation would be in a directory called LM90, with LM90.bat launching the program. This version is 8.02, with the latest version being 9.05. Please note that the service packs for v9.05 on the GE Fanuc support site may not be compatible with the demo v8.02; you need to be on v9.05 for proper functionality.

With version 8.02, the highest level CPU you can configure is a CPU352. CPUs 360, 363, 364, and 374 were not available when v8.02 was released, so they may not be supported. In terms of program size, I was able to open folders with _MAIN blocks exceeding 2 Kbytes and communicate with a 90-30.

I vaguely recall from my time selling this product line that renaming the directory to LM90 and editing some DOS files to change references from LM90DEMO to LM90 could potentially bypass restrictions on file size. However, I cannot provide further details on this.

Ultimately, it's important to weigh the value of 'free' software against the time investment required. Results may vary, and some users have reported mild side effects. If you experience any concerning symptoms, please consult your distributor for assistance.</p>
