            <p>Finding the perfect definition for a word can be quite challenging, as evidenced by the numerous definitions provided on dictionary.com. When it comes to the term "corrective," two definitions stand out: one that emphasizes restoring something to its normal state, and another that focuses on fixing what is not working properly. The word "corrective" is rich in synonyms, with "punitive" being a particularly interesting choice. Are you familiar with the concept of punitive maintenance?</p>

            <p>In a discussion started by Jim Maslach on 12 July 2005, the topic of failure interpretation in RCM was addressed. A key point made by Vee highlighted the importance of distinguishing between Functional Failure and incipiency conditions. Corrective Maintenance (CM) was defined as any work done post-incipiency, whether initiated by condition monitoring or inspection. Breakdown Maintenance (BM), on the other hand, occurs when failures are sudden and unexpected. RCM helps identify on-failure tasks, which are categorized as BMs. By effectively managing performance indicators, organizations can reduce breakdowns, trips, and failures that impact safety, asset value, and profitability. V.Narayan (Vee), author of 'Effective Maintenance Management: Risk and Reliability Strategies for Optimizing Performance', emphasizes the need for a strategic approach to maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>I have been grappling with the concept of corrective maintenance for some time now. Despite the challenges, reflecting on different definitions has provided some clarity. It is crucial to determine a definition and stick to it consistently, even if it may vary globally. Keeping the definition consistent within your organization is key to avoiding confusion and challenges. Corrective maintenance is essentially an action taken in response to a measured or observed condition, whether before or after functional failure.</p>

            <p>Hello Terry and Everyone, 

I have been immersed in the world of plant maintenance, and the term "Corrective Maintenance" has been a topic of frequent discussion. This term can hold various meanings depending on the type of industry or plant being discussed. According to Tokutaro Suzuki, a Senior Consultant at JIPM, in his book "TPM in Process Industries," Corrective Maintenance is defined on page 149 as the process of improving equipment and its components to enable more reliable preventive maintenance. This is especially important for equipment with design flaws which need addressing.

In Suzuki's view, Corrective Maintenance can also be seen as a proactive approach within the framework of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). However, in industries like power plants, Corrective Maintenance is often viewed as reactive, involving repairs after equipment breakdowns or failures.

When it comes to maintenance strategies, different terms are used. Reactive Maintenance, also known as Run to Fail, Breakdown Maintenance, or Unplanned Maintenance, involves addressing issues only after they occur. Preventive Maintenance, on the other hand, is conducted on a calendar-based or time-based schedule to prevent breakdowns.

Predictive Maintenance, also known as Condition-Based Maintenance, focuses on monitoring equipment condition to predict and prevent failures. Similarly, Proactive Maintenance involves modifications, redesigns, and maintenance prevention to improve equipment reliability.

In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all definition of Corrective Maintenance. It can be either proactive or reactive, depending on the context and industry.

            <p>In order to optimize maintenance procedures, it is beneficial to categorize corrective maintenance into two distinct groups: planned and unplanned. Planned corrective maintenance refers to work that is proactively completed before a breakdown occurs, while unplanned corrective maintenance is conducted in response to a breakdown. Introducing a separate category for work carried out after a deficiency is identified during a preventive maintenance check (PM) would enhance clarity and effectiveness. By tracking CMP (planned corrective maintenance) and CMU (unplanned corrective maintenance) occurrences, an organization can gauge the performance of their maintenance program. A higher number of CMPs and fewer CMUs indicates a well-functioning program, while a higher number of CMUs and fewer CMPs suggests a need for program improvement. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance efforts.</p>

            <p>Terry and others, in order to address an issue, we must first identify that something is not performing as expected. This determination can only be made through measurement using our senses or instruments, along with established performance standards. Prior knowledge plays a crucial role in distinguishing between corrective and preventive actions. Preventive maintenance involves proactive measures such as design calculations, historical data, expert opinions, or predictions. Breakdown maintenance can be triggered by predicting conditions or due to lack of prior knowledge. Wally's discussion on breakdown maintenance highlights the importance of differentiating between planned and unplanned maintenance. Mike emphasizes the significance of sticking to a consistent definition to avoid confusion. Remember, if a machine malfunctions, consider whether it was a planned preventive measure, condition monitoring, or an unplanned breakdown scenario. Predictive intervention falls under condition monitoring, while addressing a failure post-occurrence is categorized as planned breakdown maintenance. If the machine stops unexpectedly, it is considered unplanned breakdown maintenance.</p>

            <p>When using a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), it is essential to differentiate between various maintenance activities to ensure effective management. Breakdown Maintenance (BD) is utilized for unplanned total functional failures or planned run-to-failure scenarios. Corrective Maintenance (CM) addresses the ad-hoc normalization of partial functional failures not identified during Preventive Maintenance (PM). Alternatively, Corrective/Preventive Maintenance (CP) is employed to address partial functional failures discovered during PM activities, providing insight into the effectiveness of the maintenance program and personnel. Maintenance tasks identified during daily walkarounds are classified as CP if scheduled in the CMMS and as CM if not. Similarly, corrective actions for abnormalities reported by operators are categorized as CM tasks.</p>

            <p>Shared by Mac Smith, the definition of preventive maintenance (PM) is crucial for the upkeep of operating equipment or systems. This involves planned tasks like inspections and servicing at specific intervals to ensure optimal functionality. The key to proactive maintenance lies in the term "preplanned", which sets the foundation for a culture of preventive measures. Conversely, corrective maintenance (CM) deals with unplanned tasks to rectify equipment or system failures. These definitions encapsulate the diverse spectrum of maintenance practices according to the authors.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I would like to clarify the difference in perspectives on corrective maintenance between the East (Japan) and the West. In Japan, where Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is commonly practiced, corrective maintenance is seen as a positive way to improve processes. However, in Western countries, corrective maintenance is often associated with unplanned or unscheduled downtime. It's important to understand these differences in interpretation to effectively implement maintenance strategies. Best regards,</p>

            <p>In my opinion, Corrective Maintenance is simply one type of maintenance that should be carefully considered in order to address various organizational risks. These risks can impact Health, Safety, Environment, Profitability, Asset Life, and Reputation. The choice of maintenance strategy should be based on the level of risk associated with potential failures. For low-risk failures, such as run-to-failure or breakdown situations, it may be acceptable to allow the failure to occur. However, for high-risk failures, age-based (time, cycle, starts, etc.) or condition-based (PdM) maintenance strategies should be utilized based on the probability density curve. If a suitable task cannot be found for high-risk failures, it may be necessary to redesign processes, equipment, or provide additional training. It is important to focus on scientific methods rather than rigid dogma when determining maintenance strategies.</p>

            <p>Hello Vee, I completely agree with your thoughts. The terminology for maintenance tasks varies across industries, with no universal standard in place. My perspectives are shaped by my industry experience, where different terms are used to describe similar tasks. For example, in the mining sector, maintenance craftspeople refer to "Run To Destruction" instead of the more common "Run To Fail." Similarly, practitioners of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) at the JIPM awards level may use the term "corrective maintenance" to encompass modifications and enhancements. During my consulting work with power plants in our country, I discovered that "unscheduled outage" actually refers to corrective maintenance, regardless of the associated risk level. These observations are based on the diverse terminology employed in various industries, as highlighted by maintenance expert John Moubray. Have you finished writing your book? Is it available in the market yet? Warm Regards,</p>

            <p>In the Reliability Centered Maintenance Project Manager's Guide (PDF), there are key distinctions to be made in the terminology used within the Maintenance and Reliability (M & R) fields. Firstly, corrective maintenance, as outlined in the RCM Scorecard, pertains to unplanned maintenance activities aimed at restoring asset functionality. This includes any repeat maintenance necessary due to unsuccessful initial repair attempts. However, it does not encompass maintenance stemming from preventive or predictive tasks such as PM and PdM, which can be anticipated and scheduled. Corrective maintenance falls under the category of Emergency/Demand Maintenance. Secondly, in the context of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), corrective maintenance refers to efforts to enhance asset performance through modifications. Any labor and material costs related to these improvements, along with those enhancing asset maintainability, should be tracked separately and not factored into RCM Scorecard metrics unless a design enhancement recommendation arises from RCM analysis on a specific asset.</p>

            <p>Published on 11/01/2007, Maintenance Tips discussed the topic of Preventive Maintenance (PM) versus Corrective Maintenance (CM). A common source of confusion arises when a scheduled task uncovers equipment deterioration. This prompts actions to repair and restore full functionality to prevent unexpected operational issues. But is this action considered preventive or corrective? The answer is clear: if the purpose of the PM task is to maintain functional capabilities, then the repair/restore action is preventive. A well-structured PM task involves inspecting equipment condition and addressing any problems uncovered. This includes monitoring parameters for early detection of failures, identifying hidden issues, and restoring equipment that was allowed to fail. However, some CMMS programs may limit users from categorizing additional PM work as such, leading to inflated CM costs. This can cause management to question rising CM expenses despite recent improvements in the PM program. This insightful tip was provided by Anthony "Mac" Smith, the author of RCM - Gateway to World Class Maintenance.</p>

            <p>On November 6, 2007, we received feedback regarding the Preventive Maintenance (PM) Tip published on November 1st. The reader questioned the distinction between Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Corrective Maintenance (CM), disagreeing with the idea that items found during preventative maintenance should also be classified as preventive maintenance. They argued that preventive maintenance should be consistent and standardized to effectively schedule work. The reader suggested using a coding system to differentiate between PM and repairs found during PM inspections. By tracking PM costs, PM-repair costs, and CM costs, an effective maintenance program can be established. Analyzing the data can help identify the optimal balance between PM and CM activities. Clint Mileur, Maintenance Manager at JamesHardie Building Products in Peru, IL, provided this insightful feedback.</p>

            <p>There is a decision to be made when major defects are discovered during preventive maintenance (PM) as to whether they should be repaired immediately, which may increase the PM cost. Minor defects, on the other hand, do not necessarily need to be addressed right away. PM workers should determine whether to address defects immediately within the same work order, work permit, and by the same person, or to schedule a corrective/preventive maintenance work order for a later time. A general rule of thumb is to rectify defects promptly if it can be done within 1 or 2 hours, such as addressing cleanliness or looseness issues. A note should be added to the CMMS indicating that the operation has been completed. However, for more extensive repairs that require an overhaul after condition monitoring, a separate work order should be created. In terms of Equipment basic care, it is recommended to tackle any problems found immediately, rather than delaying or passing them on to someone else.</p>

            <p>In response to the query, Ramesh Gulati from ATA provided insights on Maintenance Work Classifications. Maintenance activities can be categorized into four main groups: 1. Preventive Maintenance (PM) 2. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) also known as Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) 3. Corrective Maintenance (CM) 4. Capital Projects –Maintenance (CPM). While Preventive, Predictive, and Capital Projects Maintenance are well understood, Corrective Maintenance often leads to confusion. Corrective Maintenance involves repairing assets either after preventive and predictive actions or in the event of breakdowns or failures. It aims to restore the asset to its original or acceptable condition. Corrective Maintenance can be further divided into three types: a) CM – Scheduled: includes repairs identified during preventive or predictive maintenance activities that can be planned and scheduled. b) CM - Run –to-Maintenance (RTM): this involves opting not to perform preventive or predictive maintenance on certain assets based on FMEA/RCM analysis and allowing them to run until they fail. This is a cost-effective strategy and planned repairs are carried out when needed. c) CM – Unscheduled (Run-to-Failure): also known as breakdown maintenance or reactive maintenance, this category involves fixing assets after they have failed. These repairs are considered urgent and usually disrupt the regular maintenance schedule. It's important to clarify the distinction between different types of maintenance work and emergency response protocols to ensure efficient management of assets. In some organizations, urgent maintenance may be labeled as breakdown maintenance but should still be completed within a specified timeframe, usually within 48 hours.</p>

            <p>Roger Harris, a Senior Business Consultant specializing in maintenance management, shared a strategic solution he implemented as a Maintenance Manager in a large automotive manufacturing plant. To address the challenge of measuring the effectiveness of their Preventive Maintenance (PM) system, he introduced a new work type called PMO (PM Originated work). This initiative had two significant impacts on the organization. Firstly, it enabled them to assess the performance of their PM system by identifying the proportion of repairs carried out by qualified Maintenance Crafts Personnel. Secondly, it established a distinct category for analyzing work management costs compared to the expenses incurred from running equipment to failure.

By emphasizing the importance of clean, lubricate, and inspect tasks within PM routines, the organization was able to improve the accuracy of scheduling PM tasks and anticipate equipment downtime more effectively. This approach helped strengthen relationships with equipment stakeholders, minimize unscheduled downtime, and streamline maintenance operations. This shift from reactive to proactive maintenance practices was essential for achieving scheduling accuracy goals and maximizing the value of preventive measures.

To streamline the process further, Harris recommended separating PM originated expenses from repair costs by closing PM work orders and creating dedicated PMO work orders. This not only improved cost tracking but also enhanced equipment uptime by allowing for quicker repairs with spare parts readily available. For organizations seeking to optimize their maintenance management systems, consulting with experts in EAMS/CMMS software is crucial to implementing such strategies successfully. Failure to do so may hinder the realization of the full potential of the workforce and the benefits of proactive maintenance practices.

For organizations facing similar challenges, exploring innovative solutions like the PMO work type can lead to significant improvements in maintenance operations and cost management.

            <p>Jeff Wahl recently responded to the Preventive Maintenance Tip featured in the latest edition of the Maintenance-Tips from Reliabilityweb newsletter. In his feedback, he suggested considering subdividing Corrective Maintenance (CM) into two categories: CMP and CMU to distinguish between Planned and Unplanned Corrective Maintenance. This segmentation would help differentiate CM work identified during preventive maintenance inspections from CM work initiated during day-to-day operations. Jeff also proposed the idea of labeling CMP as PMC for added clarity. Thank you, Jeff Wahl.</p>

            <p>Hello Terrence, I appreciate the engaging discussion you have initiated. After reviewing the group's responses, I believe it is important to delve deeper into the topic. Understanding whether work is Corrective or Preventive is crucial for enhancing reliability performance. Corrective actions are necessary to restore equipment to its optimal design capacity, indicating potential weaknesses in reliability that require further attention. By categorizing corrective measures in this way, it becomes easier to compare similar assets and identify models with the lowest operating costs over their lifespan. This information can not only assist the purchasing department in making informed decisions but also aid in managing the maintenance department by recognizing proactive and reactive tendencies. Planned corrective maintenance should be seen as a proactive element within the maintenance program, while unplanned corrective work can have negative implications on equipment reliability and maintenance department efficiency. It is essential to avoid unplanned corrective work whenever possible, unless it is part of a predetermined plan for run-to-failure equipment. When measuring corrective work routines, it is important to consider their impact on Maintenance Operational Performance and Equipment Reliability scores. Both aspects play a significant role in the overall continuous improvement process and require specialized training and meticulous planning of EAMS/CMMS configurations. Achieving clarity on these issues is key to resolving confusion surrounding corrective maintenance practices. Thank you for sparking this enlightening conversation.

            <p>Hello Josh, The PMO category does not currently have a set target that I am aware of. In my experience at an automotive company, the majority of man hours were spent on reactive work such as breakdowns (CM) and emergencies (EM), accounting for over 70% of our time. Only a small portion of time was dedicated to projects and preventive maintenance (PM), which was less than 5% initially. Despite PM representing 35% of work orders and only 5% of man hours, it was evident that our PM routines were not as effective as they could be, with a high percentage still being allocated to reactive work. It took us over 6 months to increase our PMO percentage from less than .001% to .02%, as we focused on changing work attitudes and increasing supervisor involvement. By the time I left the company a year ago, we had achieved a 6% PMO work type rate, with reactive work accounting for less than 30% of man hours. This improvement was a significant milestone for our facility, emphasizing the importance of tracking trends rather than fixating on specific numbers. This transformative process unfolded over a 3-year period. I trust this insight proves useful to you. Best regards, Roger Harris CMRP CPMM</p>

            <p>Josh, I provided examples of useful splits within the CM category, such as CMP for CM Planned and CMU for CM Unplanned. Another potential type is PMC for PM Corrective, which involves follow-up work by the PM that is not originally planned. This additional work, as you mentioned, could potentially be grouped under CMP. It would be beneficial to track when a CM directly affects production scheduling, in contrast to repairs initiated during operator rounds or PM activities. In my batch plant setting, there are numerous opportunities to address equipment issues without disrupting production. Since PdM repairs, operator rounds, and pre-run checks are crucial parts of maintenance, the CMMS system should have enough detail to demonstrate when repairs were made outside of the production schedule. While this level of detail is not currently available where I am, I can see the potential value in implementing it. J-</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, transforming organizational culture presents various challenges. In the past, we struggled with being proactive due to a lack of understanding. One major hurdle we faced during our culture shift was pinpointing specific areas for change. You recently inquired about the ideal percentage of PM Originated work, and I emphasized the importance of observing trends, although this approach has its limitations. According to industry standards, it is recommended to have at least 1 corrective work order for every 8 PM work orders. This ratio serves as a benchmark to gauge the effectiveness of PM practices. If this ratio is not met, it indicates either ineffective PM practices or excessive PMing. I hope this information proves valuable to you. Regards, Roger Harris CMRP CPMM</p>

            <p>These posts cover an important topic in great detail. The subject matter is vast, with countless books devoted to it. Adding to the discussion, here are some key points to consider:

1. Planning serves various purposes, but creating a weekly schedule is a crucial outcome. Surprisingly, a majority of websites struggle to generate a resource-leveled schedule automatically from their CMMS/EAM software.
2. Properly categorizing work within the CMMS/EAM system is essential.
3. Certain fields, such as Worktype, Workorder Priority, Asset Priority, and Job Status, hold more significance than others.
4. Inaccurate maintenance backlog data can lead to ownership issues. Some organizations appoint a "gatekeeper" to effectively manage this.
5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are valuable for management decisions, relying heavily on accurate database information.
6. Defining and measuring Reactive maintenance is a crucial KPI, highlighting its importance in maintenance operations.

As an experienced CMMS/EAM consultant, I've observed various system designs and approaches to integrated planning and scheduling. Not all organizations have qualified Job Planners or schedulers, necessitating creativity in strategy development. Consider the following checkpoints for evaluating your maintenance system:

1. Do you have a structured WEEKLY SCHEDULE process?
2. Can you analyze weekly compliance effectively?
3. Is over 90% of your backlog planned at any given time?
4. Are you tracking Reactive maintenance effectively?
5. Do you have a plan to transition from reactive to proactive maintenance?

While I have not authored a book, I did publish a white paper in Maintenance Technology in March 2006, focusing on The Elusive Weekly Schedule. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Contact me at Synterprise Solutions for further insights at 423-267-5363.</p>

            <p>Tracking follow-up maintenance after a preventive maintenance (PM) operation or procedure is crucial for getting a return on investment. Any additional corrective work that arises as a result of PM activities should be documented on a separate work order and coded properly. This proactive approach is essential for a lean maintenance program, with follow-up corrective work ideally making up 12% to 20% of total PM activities. Efficient Work Management systems are key to the success of any Reliability and Lean Maintenance Program. All work must be recorded and classified into specific categories for analysis, including Proactive, Reactive, and Other. It's important to differentiate between work codes and problem codes when categorizing activities. By consistently recording, measuring, and analyzing work data, improvements can be made continuously. If analysis reveals an excessive amount of corrective work or emergency maintenance after PM activities, it may be necessary to adjust the frequency of PM tasks. Aim for the 12% to 20% Sweet Spot to optimize your maintenance program. This valuable advice is shared by Leon Reed Sr., a seasoned Reliability Engineer at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, IN.</p>

This includes considering the addition of new check points or revisions to existing instructions, especially for equipment units. It is also advisable to conduct a Pareto analysis to identify the number of corrective work orders resulting from PM findings. What are your thoughts on a PM program that yields less than 12% of corrective maintenance?</p>

            <p>In order to improve efficiency and record-keeping, any additional corrective work should ideally be documented on a separate work order. While this is a must for major projects, for smaller tasks it may not be necessary as they can simply be added to the existing preventive maintenance work order. This approach is more practical and time-saving. When it comes to follow-up work, experts suggest that it should ideally account for 12 to 20% of the total work orders. This figure is based on industry standards and best practices. Have you found this to be accurate in your plant's operations?</p>

            <p>Engaging and informative discussions have taken place surrounding the team's experiences in Saudi Arabia, particularly in relation to ISO 14224:1999(E) definitions of corrective/preventive maintenance. Corrective maintenance refers to maintenance performed post-fault recognition to restore functionality, while preventive maintenance is carried out at set intervals to reduce the likelihood of failure or degradation. 

For over 8 years, CMMS has been utilized in various steam/gas power plants in Saudi Arabia, incorporating a user-friendly classification system. Preventive maintenance (PM) orders are system-generated, triggered either automatically or manually based on predetermined criteria approved by Technical Support Division Engineers. In contrast, corrective maintenance (CM) orders are created by maintenance planners post-fault recognition.

Traditionally, some plants classified Major Preventive Maintenance/Testing & Inspections (T&I) as PM, while others categorized them separately. Efforts are being made to standardize this classification method. Fault recognition is typically carried out by Operations personnel, leading to the creation of Work Requests classified as CM in CMMS.

Condition Based Monitoring (CBM) data is collected by specialized crews or trained operators in different power plants, with corrective actions based on CBM reports addressed through CM work orders. There have been debates regarding the utilization of the CMMS CBM work type solely for automatically generated orders based on CBM data uploads.

In 2006, technical issues arose post-CMMS upgrade, prompting ongoing resolution efforts with the vendor. Data from the latest version running since June 2006 show that PM, T&I, and CM constitute the majority of orders created. Other order types include special projects, commissioning, non-equipment related tasks, and Condition Based Maintenance.</p>

            <p>Hello Ganesh, thank you for sharing your valuable experience with us. I would like to address a few points based on your input:

a) It seems that you include bills of materials in your PM tasks, such as overhauling rotating equipment.
b) Planned outages during shutdowns or turnarounds should be classified as PM activities, regardless of when they are scheduled. It may be beneficial to differentiate between PM tasks carried out during regular maintenance and those done during shutdowns for analysis purposes.
c) How do you categorize unplanned/accidental breakdowns and planned/intentional breakdowns (or run-to-failure)? Are they all grouped under CM, or do you find it necessary to distinguish between them?
d) I suggest adding a new work type, CP for Corrective/Preventive, to address follow-up tasks identified during PM and CBM activities. This will help demonstrate the effectiveness of your maintenance and condition-based monitoring in detecting defects or anomalies.
e) Our definition of PPM (Planned Preventive Maintenance) includes fixed time maintenance, predictive maintenance (or CBM), inspections, and testing. This aligns with the ISO definition, which emphasizes maintenance according to set intervals or criteria. Therefore, a separate work type for CBM may not be essential. We have a plant change (PC) category for project-related tasks, including modifications and commissioning. Are temporary plant changes tracked under this category? Additionally, we allocate a non-core maintenance category for miscellaneous and standing instruction tasks.</p>

            <p>Hello Wally, I completely agree with your suggestion to standardize work types. We have come across numerous interesting references, both local and international, such as SMRP, ERPI (referenced in the 'Optimizing Power Plant Maintenance' article by Patrick Abbott in POWER magazine, December 2004 issue), various ISO standards, discussions on this forum, Saudi ARAMCO's General Instruction on Maintenance Work Orders, SABIC/UNITED SAP-Plant Maintenance Work Order Types, and more. However, it appears that there is no universal standard for classifying maintenance work types across industries. With over 40 power plants spread across Saudi Arabia, some of which are power and desalination plants, our team has been working towards harmonizing the plant maintenance and project system business processes for almost a year now. One key aspect we are focusing on is standardizing plant maintenance and project systems work types, which is only halfway accomplished. Regards.

Dear Josh, Thank you for your in-depth feedback. Here are my responses to your comments: a) I find your comment unclear. Our T&I work includes both rotating and stationary equipment like heat exchangers, condensers, steam generators, etc., covering main equipment, their auxiliaries, and balance-of-plant. Terms such as 'Shutdown Maintenance during Planned Outages', 'Testing & Inspection', 'Turnaround', 'Annual Maintenance', 'Annual Overhaul', etc. all fall under 'T&I'. b) I agree that maintenance performed during planned outages (T&I) is also a form of PM. While some of our power plants have historically classified this as PM, others considered it a separate work type (T&I) until a recent decision to align it with PM after a heated debate. T&I requires advance planning and budgeting for resources like long-lead materials, capital spares, T&I contractors, and specialized equipment. The complexity and cost of T&Is justify classifying them separately for better planning, budgeting, control, and analysis. c) Unplanned breakdowns were previously classified as CMs with 'A' or 'Very High' priority. Some had tried labeling this as 'Emergency Maintenance' in the past but reverted back as it falls under CM regardless of urgency. There is a proposal to introduce 'RTF' (Run-to-failure) as a sub-type of CM for planned/intentional breakdowns. d) A proposal is being discussed to create a sub-type of CM for corrective work identified during PM/CBM activities. There is debate whether such corrective work should be classified under PM/CBM or CM. e) Referring back to item-b, using 'fixed-interval' instead of 'fixed-time' would be more appropriate for PM or T&I activities based on intervals like EOH. Practical definitions from ISO 14224 are being considered. f) 'Plant changes' may be better categorized under 'Improvements/Modifications/Upgrades' work type instead of the current 'special projects/modification' CMMS type. Possible sub-types could include various project types like capital modifications/upgrades, non-capital modifications/upgrades, engineering studies, proactive work from audits or studies, etc. Temporary plant changes, such as bypassing interlocks due to instrumentation issues, are typically addressed through multi-task CM work orders. g) The separate 'commissioning (new equipment)' work type may be removed as it was mostly used for tracking warranties in new/upgrade projects, with a sub-type for warranties remaining. h) 'Non-core maintenance' could be a more appropriate term than 'non-equipment related' work type. The concept of 'standing work instructions jobs' will be further discussed with our team, as we currently have 'standing work orders' but they are not classified as a work type. Regards.</p>

            <p>a) Do you include spare parts in the PM plan itself? I believe the answer is yes based on your statement that the quantity of component requirements is known. Can you explain what is meant by "zero-based maintenance budgeting"? Is T&I an abbreviation for Turnaround and Inspection? b) If you want to monitor T&I work orders, we can utilize a different PM work type or utilize the work center or a separate project budget code within the cost center. c) It's great that you are interested in implementing RTF. I previously mentioned RTF, and the initial response was questioning whether we want to complicate things. d) I agree that corrective/preventive work from PM should be categorized under PM. Personally, I am curious to see the actual percentage in practice. e) Using "fixed interval" is a more comprehensive term to refer to fixed calendar time and fixed counter time like running hours. f) Your explanation of plant changes is thorough as it encompasses engineering studies, continuous improvements, energy/environmental studies, and more. Temporary changes can include bypassing interlocks, which is crucial for managing changes in DCS, BMS, PLC systems. Additionally, some piping repairs may fall into this category as outlined in the UKOOA integrity management document. g) I believe SAP PM has the capability to track warranties for new/upgrade equipment if configured appropriately, although I have not yet utilized this feature. h) I suspect that standing work instructions and standing work orders are essentially the same thing but with slightly different terminology.</p>

            <p>Dear Josh, Thank you for your prompt response and for addressing some of my concerns. Here are the key points:

a) In our Preventive Maintenance (PM) plans, we do include the necessary spare parts/materials. However, not all PM plans require parts/materials. For some plans, materials are withdrawn from the warehouse in practical amounts and stored near the workshops, such as lubrication oil/grease. Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB) is an approach to budgeting that prioritizes justifying all costs and activities for the upcoming budget period, rather than relying on previous budget figures. Traditional incremental budgeting only focuses on changes from the previous year's budget. The proposal to update work types for Testing & Inspection (T&I) activities at some power plants has gained approval in principle, with the decision pending on whether they will be classified as sub-types of PM or as separate work types.

b) Regarding tracking T&I work orders, it is beneficial to use separate project budget codes in the cost center, as demonstrated by a Saudi company utilizing SAP-PM. In our plants, T&I tasks are carried out by a combination of contractors and employee groups. There is ongoing discussion about classifying Real-Time Follow-up (RTF) tasks, with a proposal to classify it as a sub-type of Corrective Maintenance (CM) gaining traction.

c) There is ongoing debate about classifying faults and implementing Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) and Predictive Maintenance (PdM) data collection methods. One suggestion is to trigger CBM/PdM work orders using the Preventive Maintenance Master Data. We have introduced a standardized process for handling follow-up work orders from PM/PdM/CBM/T&I activities, emphasizing the importance of creating CM work orders for corrective actions.

d) According to the "6 to 1 Rule," the ratio of PM to CM work orders should ideally be 6 to 1, indicating that if the ratio deviates significantly, adjustments may be needed to the maintenance program.

e) We are making strides towards standardization, aiming to streamline processes and procedures. This will benefit our operations and ensure consistency across the board.

f) Managers have historically been reluctant to use interlock bypass registers in control rooms, preferring to rely on CM work orders instead. I will review the "UKOOA Integrity Management" document as recommended.

g) Some companies using SAP-PM implement Warranty Work under PM activity type M11 in work orders.

h) Thank you for encouraging me to participate in the forum. I appreciate the guidance from our project coordinator and team lead. Best regards.</p>

            <p>Ganesh, you are quite the prolific writer compared to me. Your in-depth explanations can sometimes take a while to absorb fully. However, studies have shown that explaining a subject to others can enhance our own understanding. Therefore, your active participation in this forum is certainly a positive step. 

a) I now have a better grasp of Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB). 
b) Within SAP Plant Maintenance (PM), each work order type can be linked to multiple Maintenance activity types through configuration (i.e., a one-to-many mapping). It's important to note that some Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS) may not have Activity types, resulting in multiple work types instead. The assignment of work centers to internal staff groups overseeing contractor work execution is crucial for efficient management. 
c) Understood. 
d) Corrective and preventive work orders can be distinguished and tracked separately, although some tasks may fall in between. This is where the Corrective/Preventive (CP) work type comes into play. In some cases, corrective actions may also be considered preventive measures. 
i) Is there a specific reason for differentiating between faults and incipient faults? 
ii) Work Orders (WOs) should be generated for all maintenance tasks, regardless of who performs them. 
iii) WOs should also be created for tasks carried out by operators. Some organizations emphasize operator-driven maintenance for improved reliability and efficiency. While this may be out of your comfort zone, operators in our case are already submitting notifications, so transitioning to processing WOs should be a smooth process for them. 
iv) Standardizing all plant maintenance activities within the CMMS provides a centralized data center for analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs). This eliminates the need for separate databases, which can complicate data integration and analysis. 
v) Can you clarify the concept of a discovery Work Order (WO)? Does it refer to tasks identified after equipment inspections, such as during shutdown periods? If so, these emerging tasks can be classified as corrective or preventive maintenance actions as needed. 
vi) Is there a specific rationale behind the 6 to 1 rule? Does it suggest that for every 6 preventive maintenance tasks, one follow-up work order should be generated? While the idea sounds promising, implementing it effectively may pose challenges. 
f) It is advisable to document interlock bypasses and all software changes in the CMMS for comprehensive maintenance tracking. 
g) The PM Activity Type is a subset of the PM Work Order type. Some plants using SAP PM may utilize standard codes like PM03 and M11 instead of direct abbreviations for work types, creating a potential challenge for users to memorize them without detailed definitions within the system.</p>

            <p>Dear Josh, I appreciate your timely response. I'll keep it short this time! Thank you for clarifying the relationship between Maintenance Activity Type and Order Type. We can discuss work-centers later. Your use of CP (Corrective/Preventive) code is effective. Some alternatives like 'PM-Repair', 'PMO' (PM originated work), and 'PMC' have been suggested as well, aligning with Leon's recommendation to separate follow-up maintenance in a distinct work order. SMPR also proposes a similar approach. If you use CP type, what is the ratio of CP to total PMs? Leon suggests that follow-up maintenance should constitute 12% to 20% of PM work in a lean maintenance setting, in accordance with John Day's 6:1 rule. I have come up with more code ideas while reviewing forum discussions: FM (Follow-up maintenance to PM, PdM, Testing & Inspections, etc.), and DW (Discovery Work). Regarding classifying minor follow-up maintenance as PM by incorporating operations/tasks in the same work order, do you still follow this practice in your organization? Will it complicate cost tracking? I brought up Mike's concept of differentiating between BM & CM based on the 'incipiency' condition. We believe that all CM work orders, except those with '1' or 'A' priority, are scheduled. Even less critical equipment intentionally allowed to run-to-failure like circulating water pump traveling water screen motors are classified as CM. The RTF sub-type needs approval. Our team has decided to stop 'minor' work requests for maintenance tasks carried out by operators without a work order due to cost tracking concerns. Your suggestion to create work orders for operators aligns with modern maintenance practices but may require significant change management efforts. Are you implementing this in your organization and since when? Regarding Discovery work being equivalent to CP, I agree. Best regards.</p>

            <p>The success of any system depends on how well it is utilized by its users. The key principle of keeping it simple (KISS) is crucial, especially when all tradesmen are responsible for creating work orders. This is why we only use common abbreviations like SF for service fitting, CR for corrective repair, BR for breakdown repair, and CP for capital projects, and PM for preventive maintenance routines. However, mistakes can still occur due to carelessness or accidents. Having a dedicated maintenance planner enter data can make a difference. It is important to choose a system and ensure user buy-in to maintain consistency. Stick to the chosen system for optimal results. - Mike.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, We are currently evaluating all forum posts as part of our efforts to streamline maintenance business processes through flowcharts in Saudi Arabia. It is more practical to prioritize follow-up maintenance in the same order as it saves time compared to creating a new plan. If the actual costs of follow-up maintenance exceed the planned costs, it can be seen as a disadvantage, as preventive maintenance (PM) orders are usually planned accurately. Some managers believe that PM work orders are included in an approved PM program rather than being created by planners, which I personally agree with for ease of implementation. A common issue we have observed is that operations sometimes create additional 'minor' notifications for small maintenance tasks like cleaning or filter replacement, impacting productivity calculations. We have a dedicated CMMS champion and have already begun discussions on change management within our group. Please review the attached presentation at your convenience. In our operations, the work type is indicated in the CMMS work request, with the planner having the flexibility to make changes when creating the order. It is crucial for technicians to input closing comments accurately rather than generic statements like 'PM done' or 'job completed'. We are considering the idea of standardizing our system and are in the process of deciding on potential changes as we transition to a new system. I will be applying for a KISS waiver. Best regards, Mike.</p>

            <p>Thank you for sharing your detailed and helpful work, VJG. I have some suggestions regarding Priority definitions. When it comes to maintenance, the goal is to minimize the risk of failure (Probability x Consequence). Therefore, High Risk should equal High Priority. Both Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Corrective Maintenance (CM) should be considered High Priority if they impact critical equipment downtime. Increasing the proportion of PM tasks in the list can help maintain control and is a desirable objective. It's important to note that 'Emergency' should only be used for unplanned events, not for routine PM tasks. Priority rankings may need adjustments if the reliability of Standby equipment decreases while a Duty item is being repaired. Urgent tasks should not be automatically equated to High Priority if the urgency is due to administrative reasons rather than high risk. It's crucial to align Priority approvals with Authority levels to ensure a focus on managing risks effectively. Aim to eliminate administrative urgencies where possible and utilize SAP to identify inefficiencies.</p>

            <p>I concur with your insights, Vee. The concept of prioritizing equipment upgrades with redundancy is commonly practiced by operators when submitting work requests. It is crucial to note that equipment criticality escalates when one piece of equipment is inoperable. By conducting a Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) exercise first, the risk assessment (probability x consequences) can be effectively ranked in the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). There is often confusion between high priority and emergency or urgency, making it challenging to clarify.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, I wanted to clarify that all preventive maintenance (PM) work orders are approved before being created by planners. As mentioned in my initial post on August 27, 2008 (item-2a), PM packages must first be approved by Technical Support Division Engineers and configured in the CMMS system. Once configured, PM orders do not require planning efforts, but scheduling efforts will still be necessary. Your question and Mike's comments prompted us to conduct a survey to determine the number of PM work orders manually created by maintenance planners versus those created by the system. After analyzing historical data from 15 power plants in the Eastern Sector over 27 months, we found that 5% of work orders were manually created, while 95% were created by the system. This data sheds light on the varying philosophies and practices within our organization. We also confirmed a previous finding that some power plants consistently create Major Preventive Maintenance work orders manually instead of utilizing the PM program. This aligns with our discussions regarding T&I work type in my previous post. As for RCM implementation, it may take some time for personnel to grasp concepts like 'probability of failure' and 'consequences of failure'. Some power plants have not accurately filled out criticality fields, despite the fact that criticality can change dynamically. Thank you for sharing these concepts and philosophies – they will be discussed further to enhance the 'priority' field in our system.</p>

            <p>It is important to understand the significance of the 5% representation in creating a formal PM program. Once the PM is established by the planner, it should be integrated into a structured PM program for future execution. This step is crucial in rectifying any "missing or overlooked" PM tasks or those deemed unnecessary during the initial mass creation of PMs. Ideally, this should be addressed before the first production as part of the pre-operational readiness program. Such initiatives are essential components of PM change management and continuous improvement programs within manufacturing plants.</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, Vee & Mike,

In December 2000, a Technical Report titled "Plant Maintenance Optimization Assessment Guideline" by M. Perakis for EPRI (ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE, INC.) Project Manager was discovered by my colleague, Frank H. Gagaring, online. This report was previously mentioned in an ERPI article in POWER Magazine during our research. The following points from the report are pertinent to our discussions:

a) Corrective Maintenance (CM) involves reacting to equipment breakdowns that lead to operational losses. This can be categorized as "reactive," "breakdown," "corrective," or "run-to-failure" maintenance. Corrective maintenance can be effective for certain equipment but may result in high repair costs for others. It is crucial to apply this technique appropriately to develop an optimized maintenance strategy, especially for fossil plants.

b) Different categories of corrective Work Orders include:
- CM-RTF Run-to-Failure (Pre-planned strategy from RCM analysis)
- CM-CDM Condition-based Maintenance (Work resulting from PM, PDM, PAM)
- CM-CDM-P1&P2 Condition-based Maintenance with urgent or emergency priority
- CM-U Unplanned Work

c) Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) programs assist power producers in optimizing maintenance practices.

d) Four main approaches determine maintenance work: Preventive (PM), Corrective (CM), Predictive (PDM), and Proactive (PAM); all are essential components of maintenance strategies.

I trust that this information is engaging and relevant to our discussions. Best regards.</p>
