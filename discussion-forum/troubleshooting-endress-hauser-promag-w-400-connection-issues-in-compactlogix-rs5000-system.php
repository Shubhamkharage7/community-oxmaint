                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently integrating an Endress Hauser Promag W 400 into a plant-wide monitoring system controlled by a CompactLogix RS5000 system. The process of adding it to my I/O tree was straightforward thanks to the ability to download an .eds file through the browser application. By navigating to Tools -> EDS Hardware Installation Tool, I was able to seamlessly incorporate the device into the system.

The PLC has an IP address of 192.168.1.2, while the Promag 400's IP address is 172.17.41.186. I have successfully pinged and connected to the Promag from my laptop. However, when attempting to go online with the PLC, I encountered an error message stating '16#0204 Connection Request Error: Connection Request Timed Out'. Based on my research, this issue may stem from a physical problem, such as a network switch.

Troubleshooting this error is proving to be challenging due to the size of the plant and the numerous switches between the panel and the unit. I am seeking guidance on how to address this issue and determine if it is indeed caused by a physical obstacle. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! -Matt</p>

            <p>In the demonstration video for the electromagnetic flowmeter Proline Promag W 400-5W4C by E&H, the individual showcases using an application to adjust the IP address of his PC to align with the Promag's subnet. The default subnet appears to be 192.168.1.xxx, as shown in the video. Since the connection was point-to-point via a cable, a gateway was not required. It is important to note the subnet of your PC in relation to the Promag's IP address. If your Promag is at 172.17.41.186, your network may require routing through a gateway router. For simple configuration purposes, it is recommended to set up the Promag locally, ensuring both the PC and Promag are on the same subnet as demonstrated in the video.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the delayed response. I appreciate the information, danW, but I believe the issue lies in the communication between the PLC and Promag, not my PC->Promag connection. My goal is to transfer inputs to the PLC and display them on a HMI. The Promag controller tags have automatically included various inputs like volume flow and total flow, but they are all displaying a value of 0.0. Additionally, the 'Connection Faulted' input shows a value of 1.</p>

The issue could likely be related to cable connectivity or incorrect IP address/subnet mask settings. While I agree it may be an IP address/subnet mask issue, I will further explore this path.

            <p>I hate to keep repeating myself, but are your programmable logic controller (PLC) and ProMag device on the same subnet? This is crucial for seamless communication and integration between the two devices.</p>

            <p>The IP addresses for my devices are as follows: PC LocalIP is 192.168.1.180 with Subnet 255.255.255.0 and Gateway information. The PC WirelessIP is 172.17.41.188 with Subnet 255.255.0.0 and Gateway details. The PLC has an IP of 192.168.1.2 with Subnet 255.255.255.0 and Gateway settings. The Promag's IP is 172.17.41.186 with Subnet 255.255.255.0 and Gateway at 172.17.41.1. 

Currently, I can successfully connect the PC to Promag wirelessly. However, I need to establish a connection between the PLC and Promag, which are located across the plant from each other. Both devices are connected to hubs on the network. 

I am wondering if the issue lies in the mismatch of their IP addresses. Would changing the Promag's IP to 192.168.1. help resolve the connectivity problem between the PLC and Promag?</p>

            <p>When setting up your device IP addresses, it's important to ensure that the highlighted octets match for seamless communication between devices. In this case, consider adjusting the PC and Promag IP addresses to match the PLC (192.168.1.x) for optimal connectivity. Here are the current IP addresses for your devices:

- PC LocalIP: 192.168.1.180 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: ...
- PC WirelessIP: 172.17.41.188 Subnet: 255.255.0.0 Gateway: ...
- PLC: IP: 192.168.1.2 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: ...
- Promag: IP: 172.17.41.186 Subnet: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 172.17.41.1 

Remember, a matching configuration is essential for smooth communication.</p>

            <p>OkiePC mentioned that in order for devices to communicate effectively, the highlighted octets in the IP configuration must match. It is advisable to keep the PLC unchanged and adjust the PC and Promag to match the IP configuration, specifically setting them to 192.168.1.x. The next step will involve changing the Promag to a 192.168.1.x configuration to optimize communication.</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, user LeslieMatt mentioned the importance of setting a unique IP address for the Promag device on a network. To do this, consider changing the IP address to 192.168.1.x, ensuring that the 4th octet is different to avoid duplicate IP addresses. Before assigning the address, ping it from a command prompt to confirm that no other devices on the network are using it. It's crucial to prevent network issues that can arise from identical IP addresses. Always verify network connections and ping the address for certainty. This precautionary step is essential to avoid potential problems.</p>

            <p>I am struggling to make this work successfully. Is it necessary for a RS5000 plc and every connected device to share the same IP address - for example, PLC: 192.168.1.2 and Device: 192.168.1.176?</p>

            <p>It would be beneficial to include a network sketch in order to troubleshoot the issue between the PLC and flow meter. How many gateways are in place, as they may be blocking the Ethernet traffic? Try disconnecting the Ethernet cable from the PLC and connecting it to your laptop to ping the flow meter and access its webpage. This could help determine if the gateway configuration is the cause of the problem.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I want to express my gratitude for all the assistance provided. I recently resolved the issue that was affecting my system and wanted to share the solution. The individual who initially configured the system mistakenly ran the network cable through an Anybus before connecting it to the plc/hmi switch. As a result, the new module is using a standard IP address while the rest of the devices are utilizing Modbus TCP. I appreciate all the support received during this process.</p>
