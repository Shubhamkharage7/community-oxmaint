                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Dear brothers,

We are reaching out to address an issue we encountered while using a piece of equipment we recently purchased. A PLC company in Korea identified a possible problem with the PLC, but due to a password restriction, they found it challenging to resolve. The equipment company suggested changing the communication line, but progress has been slow. Even after replacing the communication cable, the same issue persists.

After researching online, it appears that our Allen Bradley PanelView Plus may be stuck in remote mode, which aligns with our current situation. However, taking action based on this information has proven to be difficult.

The model of PLC we are using is the 1766-L32BXB. We are unsure how to proceed without the password, as the equipment company is reluctant to share it. Do you have any suggestions on how we can overcome this obstacle?

We appreciate your attention to this matter and eagerly await your valuable feedback.

Thank you.</p>

            <p>In a PLC, the DINT tag dictates which page the HMI displays. When the DINT tag is set to 0, the HMI can be changed using the HMI interface. However, if the value is not 0, the HMI will display the specified page or a default page if the specified page does not exist (e.g. 6734). If you attempt to change the page when the value is not 0, you will encounter the mentioned error. Unfortunately, the MicroLogic family does not support a master password. If you are unable to access the PLC to alter the tag value, is it possible to reprogram the HMI to reference a different tag? In the past, I have reprogrammed welding cells to display the status of turntable sensors for just one second during the AUTO cycle before reverting back to 0. This allowed operators to quickly check other machines without having to switch modes. Previously, they would have to switch to service or teach mode to view a different screen.</p>
