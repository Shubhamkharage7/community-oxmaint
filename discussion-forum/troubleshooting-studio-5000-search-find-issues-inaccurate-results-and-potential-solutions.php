                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Have you encountered any issues with the Search > Find feature in Studio 5000 being unreliable? Despite having used Rockwell software for almost a decade, I do not recall experiencing difficulties in locating instruction tags within routines using this feature in the past. When searching with one or more routines open, the search results may not display all the instruction tags used in the program. The number of tags found each time varies - sometimes it returns zero, other times two or three, and occasionally it misses an instruction on a branch even though it found the same instruction on the same rung of the same routine. To ensure accuracy in tag search results, I have discovered that closing all open routines, highlighting the main routine (without opening it), and then conducting the search yields the best outcomes. It is unclear whether this issue is a bug in Rockwell software or if there is a configuration error on my end, but troubleshooting our refrigeration system was quite challenging due to this. The provided screenshots illustrate the different search results obtained using various methods. Perhaps the search direction setting needs to be adjusted to scan through all routines from bottom to top for more comprehensive results. Have you also encountered this issue, or is there something I should address on my end before reaching out to Rockwell for assistance?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After further experimentation, I discovered that the Search/Find feature in my routine only searches from the highlighted point down to the last routine listed, ignoring any routines above it. I'm curious if this has always been the case, as I don't recall it functioning this way before. Could there be a glitch causing this issue?</p>

            <p>If you are looking to conduct a tag search instead of a cross-reference, visit your Controller Tags, locate the specific tag, right-click, and choose "Go to Cross Reference." This will display all regular occurrences of that tag within your project. It seems like this is the function you are attempting to perform. Personally, I rarely use the search feature, except perhaps to locate comments rather than tags.</p>

            <p>The Wrap feature should have been automatically selected, but it seems to remember the previous selection. If it was deselected before, that may be the reason. Personally, I prefer the Text Only search option over Exact Match. This option searches through descriptions as well, resulting in more comprehensive results. Additionally, when using the Find Within option, I make sure to select all options under Ladder Diagrams. This ensures that instruction types and tag comments are included in the search, making it easier to find specific instructions. While this may lead to more results than desired, it's better to have an abundance of results than none at all.

For newcomers to the Logix platform or those returning after a hiatus, I recommend utilizing the Cross Reference feature. It proves to be much more beneficial when searching for specific tags or instructions within the logic. Furthermore, bookmarks are a handy tool for efficient searching. By placing bookmarks on certain rungs, you can easily cycle through them using the Bookmark Toolbar, which may need to be enabled through the View menu. Keep in mind that bookmarks are a computer-specific setting and may not be visible on a different device.

In conclusion, the Cross Reference and Bookmarks features are essential tools that I frequently utilize in my work with Logix programming.</p>

            <p>When utilizing the bookmark feature in my first project, everything was running smoothly. However, when I attempted to access the bookmark feature in a second project while the first project was still open, I encountered Fatal Errors that caused my application to crash. Fortunately, this occurred while I was offline. Our refrigeration system runs on CO2 instead of Ammonia, and a crash while it is fully loaded would be less than ideal. I am puzzled as to why this happened. One interesting observation is that the error message mentioned Windows 8 64 bit, even though I am using Windows 11 on my PC. I tried closing the first project, reopening the second project, and accessing the bookmark feature again, only to encounter the same Fatal Error. It seems that this particular project is not allowing the bookmark feature to function properly. While it's not urgent for me to use this feature right now, I am curious about the cause of this issue, especially since I need to make some online changes to the project. Hopefully, this problem is specific to the bookmark feature and not indicative of a larger underlying issue. Thus far, I have not encountered any other problems with the project.</p>

            <p>If your Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is still running following a computer crash, there may be a solution to the issue in versions 31 and 32 according to a Tech Note. This known issue may be related to DPI scaling on your display. If you have a Tech Connect account, you can access the note. If not, the first suggested solution involves editing a registry setting. In Windows 10 or 11, you can do this by accessing the Registry Editor and deleting the Logix Designer key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Rockwell Software\Logix Designer. Before deleting, it is recommended to export and save the key for future use.

Another solution is to adjust your scale and layout settings to 100% by accessing Display Settings on the desktop. For users of version 31, another solution involves navigating to the LogixDesigner.exe file location and adjusting high DPI settings in the Compatibility tab to System (enhanced). As version 31 is the latest, there are no updates available.

These suggestions may help resolve the issue you are experiencing with your PLC connectivity.</p>
