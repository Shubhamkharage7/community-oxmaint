            <p>Are you looking to improve your maintenance processes and reduce downtime in your plastic packaging factory in Yucatan, Mexico? Transforming from corrective to preventive maintenance is crucial for optimizing equipment reliability and minimizing costs. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Begin by preparing a preventive maintenance (PM) plan to increase equipment reliability.
2. Analyze PM plan compliance to ensure all maintenance tasks are being carried out efficiently.
3. Identify equipment prone to repeated failures based on availability, number of failures, and manpower expenses.
4. Conduct Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for each equipment failure, creating a comprehensive list for the year.
5. Develop an action list based on RCA findings and implement necessary changes.
6. Monitor the Corrective Maintenance (CM) to Preventive Maintenance (PM) ratio to track progress.

            <p>Hello Jose, it seems like your maintenance department is primarily focused on reactive maintenance, with many work stoppages for corrective maintenance. To break free from this cycle, it is essential to implement three key strategies: effective planning & scheduling to boost productivity, implementing a robust preventive maintenance program, and establishing a Root Cause Analysis process. While this sequence is typically the best approach, it may vary depending on your specific situation. Feel free to message me for an eBook that delves deeper into the importance of these practices.

            <p>Hello Jose, it appears that your maintenance strategy lacks a proactive approach. To address this issue, I recommend the following steps. Begin by performing an asset criticality analysis to prioritize your assets. Analyze your downtime from corrective maintenance to pinpoint the most problematic assets. Utilize the failure modes of your assets to conduct a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for developing predictive and preventative maintenance plans. This analysis will serve as the foundation for a preventive maintenance (PM) program. It is essential to monitor compliance with the PM program and consider implementing Root Cause Analysis (RCA) or defect elimination to sustain improvements over time. To streamline asset management, consider implementing a CMMS/EAM system. I hope this guidance is helpful. Best regards, Veiko.</p>

            <p>Jose, in order to transition from corrective maintenance to preventive maintenance and reduce costs, it is essential to have access to a comprehensive bearing database to identify inventory duplication. Additionally, utilizing bearing vibration frequency data is crucial for establishing maintenance routes. The Bearing Expert tool can greatly assist you in developing a comprehensive plan and organizing your data effectively. Give it a try today by visiting https://sourceindex.com/trial/. If you are looking to optimize your maintenance strategy and reduce corrective work, this tool is a must-have. ------------------------------ Sue Martini ------------------------------ Original Message: Sent: 06-09-2023 18:06 From: jose ramon ramirez noriega Subject: How to change of corrective maintenance to preventive Hello, I am Ramon Ramirez from Yucatan, Mexico, working as a maintenance professional at a plastic packaging factory.
