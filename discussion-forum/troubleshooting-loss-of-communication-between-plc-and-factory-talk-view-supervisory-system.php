            <p>For users seeking information on device tags, try checking the Diagnostics folder instead of the online folder. It is likely to contain tags indicating communication failures from Linx.</p>

            <p>In the FactoryTalk Live Data connection, you can monitor predefined items such as @IsPresent and @mode that originate from the FactoryTalk Linx application's status. These items are thoroughly explained in the RSLinx Classic Help file. If you are looking to customize the wireframing behavior of a screen object when it loses connection to its data source, you may be describing a modification to its functionality.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach mentioned that there are "Predefined Items" available for monitoring the connection between FactoryTalk Live Data and the controller. @IsPresent and @mode are commonly used, originating from the FactoryTalk Linx application status. These are well explained in the RSLinx Classic help file. However, perhaps you are looking to modify the "wireframing" behavior of a screen object when it fails to retrieve data from its source. Thank you. Indeed, I need a tag to animate an object on the FT screen when communication with the PLC is lost.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach mentioned the use of "Pre Defined Items" for monitoring the FactoryTalk Live Data connection with the controller. Popular tags like @IsPresent and @mode are sourced from the FactoryTalk Linx application's status, as detailed in the RSLinx Classic Help file. If you're looking to customize a screen object's behavior in the absence of data from its source, consider making modifications to the "wireframing." Additionally, a tag on FT can indicate when the plc is offline.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach explains the use of "Pre Defined Items" for monitoring the FactoryTalk Live Data connection to the controller. Popular options include @IsPresent and @mode, which are derived from FactoryTalk Linx application's status and well-documented in the RSLinx Classic Help file. Perhaps you are seeking to customize the behavior of a screen object when it loses communication with its data source, also known as "wireframing." In that case, you may require a tag for animating objects on the FactoryTalk screen during PLC communication disruptions.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  What could be causing the object in the Factory Talk VIEW supervisory system to remain a neutral color instead of becoming transparent when communication with the PLC is lost?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The issue could be unrelated to the watchdog function and may be due to other factors affecting the communication between the PLC and the supervisory system.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Are there specific internal tags within the Factory Talk VIEW supervisory system that indicate a loss of communication with the PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: It is possible that there are internal tags within the supervisory system that are designed to indicate a loss of communication with the PLC, helping in troubleshooting and identifying the root cause of the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How can I troubleshoot and resolve the loss of communication between the PLC and the Factory Talk VIEW supervisory system if the object does not change color as expected?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: In such cases, it may be necessary to investigate other potential causes of communication interruption, review network settings, check for software configurations, and consider any hardware issues that could be impacting the connection between the PLC and the supervisory system.</p>
