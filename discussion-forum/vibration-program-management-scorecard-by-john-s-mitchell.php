                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to bring attention to a thread related to vibration in the reliability section that might have been missed by some interested individuals. I have been involved in developing the Vibration PROGRAM Management Scorecard, which was partly authored by John Mitchell and drawn from various sources. It is important to note that this scorecard is focused on program management and not technical reviews or measurement audits. I am in the final stages of preparing the document before converting it to a PDF. The draft will be shared with those interested in participating, although some ideas may be rejected after discussion. It is essential to give credit to all contributors. For a copy of the PDF when it is ready (around April 9th or 10th), please email me at fgagnon@vibra-k.com with your name and affiliation. A discussion thread may be started here for further exchange on different topics.</p>

            <p>Hello Terrence, I wanted to let you know that he has just returned from Australia. I jokingly refer to these trips as being "scraped out of your seat" because they are like forced convalescence. Currently, we have a limited number of participants for the project. I apologize if it seemed like I was trying to control the draft distribution. I did what I could. But ultimately, we all hope to have more people read the project and offer their feedback.</p>
