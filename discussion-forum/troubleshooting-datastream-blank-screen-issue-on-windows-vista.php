                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings everyone, I recently started a new role as Facility Operations Manager at a company using "Datastream 7i". I had difficulty finding online support for Datastream until I discovered this forum. As a newcomer to Datastream, I am attempting to access it from my home via the internet. Everything was running smoothly until I upgraded to Windows Vista. Now, I can log in to Datastream, but the initial matrix screen remains blank. However, when I boot up in safe mode with networking, the application functions properly. Despite trying to disable all "pop-up stoppers" and adjusting my security settings, I still encounter a blank screen in full mode. Has anyone encountered this issue before? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Tom Fitzgerald from Savannah, Georgia.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a secure way to access your office computer remotely, consider using logmein.com. I haven't personally tested it with my Vista machine on MP2, but I'd advise against networking a home computer with a business one. Logmein allows you to control your office computer from anywhere as if you were physically present, without the risk of software conflicts or data contamination. This can help ensure the security of your sensitive information while working remotely.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion. I have never encountered any issues while working from home using Windows XP. In fact, the majority of our company's employees work remotely to stay on top of their tasks. I often wish I had an assistant to handle all my administrative work, as I am constantly busy throughout the day. The only time I can dedicate to computer work is in the evenings when I am at home. If not for this, I would have to work more than 12 hours a day. Unfortunately, as a manager, I am not eligible for overtime pay.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the group of individuals who work remotely from home. I am one of those people who manage a SQL database for MP2 at two different manufacturing facilities across two states. While one facility is up and running, the other is currently transitioning from Access. To navigate the challenges posed by Vista, I rely on tools like LogMeIn or RealVNC to access my work desktop remotely. Despite its unpopularity, I must admit that I actually like Vista. However, MP2 doesn't seem to share the same sentiment. As a result, I have to access my databases through my work desktop to continue my work effectively. It's a workaround that allows me to stay productive.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding. I also prefer Vista, which is why I don't want to switch back to XP for login purposes. Since experiencing the initial issue, I have successfully used a Vista laptop without any problems. I can access Safe Mode with networking on the desktop and face no issues, although navigation can be challenging. However, the problem arises in normal mode. I believe it is another program within Vista causing this abnormal behavior.</p>

            <p>quote: In response to TomFitz, I appreciate your feedback. Personally, I prefer Vista over XP, which is why I'm reluctant to switch back. Since encountering my initial issue, I've had no problems using a Vista laptop or booting my desktop into Safe Mode with networking. However, navigating in Safe Mode can be cumbersome. The issue arises in normal mode, leading me to believe that another program in Vista is causing the problem. Which version of a web browser do you use to access 7I? In our case, 7I is not compatible with Firefox or Internet Explorer 7.0 (which Vista utilizes). Internet Explorer 6 works smoothly.</p>

            <p>Need a quick fix for your Datastream software not working after attempting to fix Windows Media Player? Try turning off your User Account Control (UAC). While disabling UAC might improve performance, it also comes with security risks. We recommend only toggling UAC settings as needed. To disable UAC, go to Start, Control Panel, and then User Accounts. From there, click on User Accounts, then Turn User Account Control on or off. If prompted, click Continue. Uncheck the box next to Use User Account Control (UAC) to protect your computer, then click OK. Restart your computer to apply the changes immediately.</p>
