                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,

Currently, I have a Laser device on my workstation that I communicate with using Putty over Ethernet IP. The Putty has been configured with a RAW connection and an assigned IP address. I am able to successfully control the Laser using string commands.

Now, I am looking to integrate this setup with a compactlogix PLC. In the past, my string communications have always been through true serial ports, so I am unfamiliar with setting up a generic module to send out strings. I have searched extensively for a solution but have not found one that fits my requirements.

Has anyone encountered a similar situation before and successfully resolved it? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Holmux</p>

            <p>What model of CompactLogix are you currently utilizing? I am not a fan of the "raw sockets" feature unless absolutely necessary; it can be quite complex to implement the logic, and I often find myself spending a significant amount of time trying to remember how and why I used it in the past. The Prosoft MVI69-GEC module is a reliable option for sending "ASCII over TCP/IP" strings to and from the controller. Alternatively, a Red Lion DataStation would also be among my top choices.</p>

            <p>I am utilizing a 1769 L33ER processor in conjunction with a Linx CSL30 laser printer from Linx Printing Technologies Ltd. The TCP/IP setup details can be found in the manual under the following designations: AL-SAR511392180-02 for Ultimate 3 TCP/IP and AL-SAR511392180-04 for Ultimate 4 TCP/IP. The configuration includes setting up the TCP/IP communication between the server (Laser) and the client (Customer Network Device) with a Listen Port of 20001. These were the specific settings I configured using Putty for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>The 1769-L33ER seamlessly integrates with the established 1769 I/O platform, making it a perfect match for the Prosoft MVI69-GEC module. Utilizing the Prosoft Configuration Builder and a helpful add-on instruction example, the complexity of the sample code is greatly reduced. Once the module is configured, sending a data string to an Ethernet device is a simple process:  
1. Create your data string
2. Transfer the data string to the Output data tags for the module
3. Specify the data length value
4. Increment the "Transmit Counter" register.  
If using the DA10 or DA30 Red Lion DataStation, a slightly more C-like programming approach would be needed, but it could potentially be more cost-effective and versatile.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach inquired about the model of CompactLogix being used. For sending "ASCII over TCP/IP" strings in and out of the controller, the Prosoft MVI69-GEC module is a recommended choice. Alternatively, a Red Lion DataStation also stands out as a good option. While considering a generic setup, incorporating a module such as the Prosoft MVI69-GSC serial module may be necessary. However, with Prosoft modules not readily available in Europe, having a spare module on hand for servicing customers becomes crucial. Therefore, opting for a module is seen as the last resort in this scenario.</p>

            <p>Within the Knowledgebase, you can find sample applications along with a programming guide for utilizing the Open Sockets feature, referred to as "Application Technique." The 1769-L33 family is equipped to support this feature, unlike the previous generation models such as L32E and L35E. You can access more information on this feature and how to implement it by visiting https://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/at/enet-at002_-en-p.pdf. Additionally, you have the option to easily set up your computer with a terminal program like RealTerm to troubleshoot and analyze the data being sent by the CompactLogix while simultaneously editing and monitoring the program within the PLC.</p>

            <p>After upgrading our system from L32 to L30ER and L33ER, we have streamlined our printing process by utilizing Ethernet TCP socket communication (telnet). We have implemented a device server to convert Ethernet output to serial for our kiosk printers. The sample code provided by Rockwell served as a solid foundation for replacing the serial port functionality. It is also possible to have multiple outputs for more sophisticated setups. For laser printers like the Brother HL-5100, there are specific guidelines that must be followed with some additional programming:

1. Adjust the output message speed to approximately 100ms per line to ensure data is not missed by the printer.
2. Implement monitoring for communication errors and include a timeout reset instruction to clear all sockets in the event of a transmission interruption.
3. Utilize a string array as a buffer to open, transmit, and close sockets similar to a standard print function.
4. Laser printers typically use 80-character lines with a default Courier New font featuring evenly spaced characters. Therefore, maintain string lengths at 80 characters unless additional font or color control characters are incorporated into the output strings.</p>

            <p>Holmux mentioned that the next task on the agenda is fixing error codes. Although the system is operational, it is a bit delicate, so adjustments and crash tests are necessary for optimal performance. Which laser and socket communication implementation did you employ? Previously, I created my own socket code, but I recently discovered that the AOI/examples in KB50122 are efficient and user-friendly. Sending a single ASCII string is plug-and-play, while adding a few extra lines of ladder logic enables seamless transmission of multiple ASCII strings.</p>

Here is the breakdown of the data I used: creating a socket requires 12 bytes, opening a connection message takes 32 bytes (8 plus the length of the destination string), encountering an error results in an error code of 16#0013 (indicating configuration data size is too short), writing a message through the socket requires 16 bytes plus the length of the string, encountering another error gives an error code of 16#00ff, with an extended error code of 16#0000_0039 (a general error), deleting a socket message requires 0 bytes, and reading a socket message requires 8 bytes.</p>

            <p>For troubleshooting Error 13 and Error 39 in your Ethernet/IP communication, it is important to understand their specific causes. Error 13 typically indicates that the source data calculations are inaccurate and that the User Defined Type (UDT) has fewer bytes than what is being transmitted. If you are utilizing the Add-On Instruction (AOI), it will assist in accurately calculating the source length. On the other hand, Error 39 is often related to the instance number not being properly copied from the Create message. Without reviewing your code, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue. The AOI, however, is designed to handle these calculations correctly. Therefore, it is recommended to utilize the AOI for efficient and error-free communication.</p>

I also modified the addressing to include the Ethernet port of the CPU and the IP address for the port. The PC socket server is set to 192.168.0.157 with Port 20001, while the PLC is configured at 192.168.0.81.</p>

            <p>Just a few days ago, I utilized this AOI in V30. Were you able to successfully implement the code by either copying and pasting it or importing it? It is essential to note that if you copy and paste the code, all values, including MSG structures and tags, will be initialized, which may cause functionality issues. However, by importing the AOI, the following steps are all that is required: 1) Utilize SKT_MSG_Client_Create.Path is$01$00, 2) Implement SKT_DATA_Client.Create_Source.Addr.Port as 20001, 3) Configure SKT_DATA_Client.Connect_Source.DestAddr to be 192.168.0.157?port=20001, 4) Adjust your Client_Data.Timeout in the AOI Configuration Dialog (e.g. set it to 20ms), 5) Ensure the client is enabled, and 6) Begin writing the data. It is crucial to carefully select the program for checking communications, as using different programs may yield mixed results. Hercules has been proven to work effectively in this regard. See how this implementation works for you.</p>

Jeev mentioned that they had used this AOI in V30 recently. Did you copy and paste the code, or did you import it? If you copied and pasted it, all values, including MSG structures and tags, will be initialized, leading to improper functioning. Importing the AOI requires the following steps:

1) Set SKT_MSG_Client_Create.Path to $01$00
2) Configure SKT_DATA_Client.Create_Source.Addr.Port as 20001
3) Specify SKT_DATA_Client.Connect_Source.DestAddr as 192.168.0.157?port=20001
4) Set the Client_Data.Timeout in the AOI Configuration Dialog to 20ms
5) Enable the client
6) Write the data

When checking the communication, be cautious with the program used as different programs may yield mixed results. Hercules has been found to work well in such cases. Give it a try and see how it goes.</p>

            <p>For those searching for detailed instructions, refer to KB QA29502 for information on sending Message (MSG) instructions through different ports on 5380 controllers. The enterprise port (Port A1) is used for connections to the enterprise network, while the device-level port (Port A2) is used for the device-level network. When setting up MSG instructions on a CompactLogix 5380 controller in Dual-IP mode, use the paths: Port A1 - 3, IP address and Port A2 - 4, IP address. In Linear/DLR mode, the path is 2, IP address. Always ensure the path is correct to avoid error code 16#0009 extend 16#0000_000c. For slot-based controllers, add 1,0 after the destination IP address to reach the backplane. Additional details can be found in the CompactLogix 5380 Controllers User Manual (5069-UM001) and the Ethernet Message Path Between Older CompactLogix Controllers guide. For specific paths to other controllers like SLC500 5/05, ML1100, and ML1400, follow the format: 4, IP_of_controller. Remember to enable both channels if the controller is in dual IP mode.</p>
