                    <p>I am looking to launch an in-house reliability program with an initial investment of $6000. The plan is to invest in vibration measuring equipment and a temperature probe. I am seeking advice on how to choose the right equipment for our needs. Should we invest in an FFT analyzer, a shock pulse vibration meter, or a simple vibration meter that can indicate if the vibration levels are within acceptable limits? Can anyone recommend a reputable source for the recommended equipment?</p>

            <p>As someone who works in a machine shop with over 60 horizontal machining centers specializing in compressor machining, I highly recommend investing in a simple vibration detector. Machine spindles are meticulously balanced by manufacturers, so any slight vibration could signal a serious issue. With each spindle costing $15,000, this investment is crucial for optimal performance. Termography may not be necessary unless you also oversee the electrical distribution system. Best of luck in your endeavors.</p>
