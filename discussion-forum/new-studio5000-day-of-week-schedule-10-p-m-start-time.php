            <p>Upon examining the DOW L5K Rockwell supplies (version v17), it appears that the GSV is utilizing the DateTime attribute instead of LocalDateTime. This indicates that the calculation is based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) rather than adjusting for your specific time zone. As a result, there may be a five-hour discrepancy from Eastern Standard Time, rather than the expected two-hour difference. It was anticipated that the day would transition at 19:00, not 22:00. Additionally, after reviewing another version (v28), the issue persists as it continues to use DateTime instead of LocalDateTime.</p>

            <p>It seems like OP may be utilizing one of the seven Day-of-Week tools available on the RA site, or possibly the sci-math-faq formula. These tools typically require the input of year, month, and day to calculate results. The change in the day value triggers a recalculation. One potential issue could be the use of WALLCLOCK/DateTime instead of WALLCLOCK/LocalDateTime, which may result in incorrect time offsets. The recent observation of the day changing 2 hours earlier than usual raises questions about what may have caused this shift since the beginning of the year. Additionally, the mention of conflicts with local date time hints at potential discrepancies in logic. To verify the accuracy of the calculations, real-time values such as .Hour from the TestDateTime structure should be compared with the Windows clock. A simpler formula for determining the current day of the week could involve calculating the microseconds since 1970 local time and applying specific calculations. This method may be challenging for CompactLogix due to the absence of LINTs, but it could be achieved using DINT pairs.</p>
