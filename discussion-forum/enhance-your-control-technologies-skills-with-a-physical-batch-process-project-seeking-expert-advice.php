                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello engineers and technicians of PLCS.net! I am seeking your expertise and guidance for a project I am working on after graduating from University. The project involves creating a physical, simulated batch process to enhance my skills in control technologies and to bolster my portfolio for potential employers.

The batch process concept consists of a compact mixing station using tanks ranging from 5-15 gallons. The system allows for the creation of RED, BLUE, and PURPLE products by mixing water, red dye, and blue dye in varying proportions. The finished product is then sent to a recycling tank for dye removal using a chlorine/bleach solution.

To control this process, a Siemens S7 PLC/IPC will be utilized. The system will include solenoid valves for controlling ingredient input, ultrasonic level sensors for measuring tank levels, and a touch-screen HMI for user interaction.

I have a few concerns regarding the project, such as the use of solenoid valves for control, the safety of using chlorine for dye removal, the best method for filtering out chlorine from the water, and the overall feasibility of the project.

Any feedback or advice on improving the design and functionality of the system would be greatly appreciated. I aim to create a visually appealing and educational model that can be used for demonstrations and presentations. Your input will be invaluable in ensuring the success of this project. Thank you for your assistance!</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When considering how to control the input to a mixing vessel, utilizing solenoid valves may be the most effective method. Gravity feeding ingredients may seem like a good idea, but it can lead to inaccuracies in the mixing process. The accuracy of the mix will depend on your desired precision level. While adding liquids like water and liquid concentrates may work well, achieving consistent control over Parts Per Million in the water can be challenging. Using dry powder dye can present even more difficulties, as it tends to clump and disrupt the gravity feeding process. To maintain a more consistent feed rate, consider using a large-diameter, low-height feed tank positioned at the highest point possible. This can help reduce the impact of varying tank levels on the feed pressure. Keep in mind the potential for toxic byproducts, such as chlorine gas, when mixing chlorine with water/dye. In general, using distilled water instead of city water can help prevent premature fading of colors. Proper ventilation, such as operating under a lab hood with an exhaust fan, can help mitigate the risks associated with chlorine fumes. Operating in a closed tank system can also help minimize exposure to harmful gases.</p>

            <p>One innovative solution is to purchase several color-sensitive photosensors with analog outputs. By setting a predetermined color level and adding dye into the mix tank until the color matches the set level, you can achieve precise control over the mixture. Although the photosensors may be a bit pricier, they will greatly enhance the accuracy of the blending process.</p>

            <p>Lancie1 suggested an interesting method that involves purchasing color-sensitive photosensors with analog outputs to achieve precise control over the mixture. By setting a color level and adding dye into the mix tank until the desired color is attained, you can ensure accurate results. While the photosensors may come at a slightly higher cost, they offer superior control compared to other methods.

I greatly appreciate the recommendation and will look into using color-sensitive photosensors for my project. Additionally, thank you for your insightful suggestions, Lancie1. Your input has been invaluable.

In terms of dye selection, it is advisable to opt for liquid solutions or tablets instead of dry powder. Dry powder dye can lead to inconsistent feeding due to clumping and sticking issues. To maintain a steady feed rate, consider using a large-diameter low-height feed tank positioned vertically to minimize pressure variations as the tank level decreases.

I am considering implementing an automated system for feeding dye tablets into my ingredient tank, along with adding water as needed. However, I am still exploring the mechanical aspects of this setup. Would using chlorine tablets be a viable option for removing dye from the final product, or should I stick to a liquid chlorine solution? I am concerned about the rapid dissipation of liquid chlorine at room temperature.

Your thoughts on the filtration process would also be appreciated, Lancie1. Thank you once again for your thorough solutions to my challenges. I am committed to exploring all possible angles to ensure the success of my project.</p>

            <p>Considering an upgrade to the system, but further evaluation is needed to source the necessary mechanical components. One potential idea is to create a tablet dispenser using a cylinder configuration, with a solenoid-operated pusher to release tablets individually. The drawback of this method is the limitation on color variations compared to using liquid dye. Consideration is also given to using chlorine tablets to eliminate the dye component from the final product, which may present a more feasible alternative over a chlorine liquid solution. Liquid mixing is easier, requiring no additional equipment, unlike tablets which may need a stirrer. Utilizing a home water pitcher filter, such as the Pur filter, could effectively remove chlorine from water. Additionally, integrating color-sensitive photoelectric sensors, like the Allen Bradley Colorsight 45CLR, could enhance color detection capabilities within the system. Further research is needed on the sensors to determine compatibility with the current PLC setup.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Looking for a cost-effective solution to improve mix accuracy? Consider implementing a Loss-in-Weight (LIW) system by measuring the amount of dye and/or water used in your process. This can be achieved by installing 2 or 3 affordable load cells or strain gages with milivolt PLC inputs. Omega Engineering Karma strain gages in the 1 to 5 lb range are a budget-friendly option at around $31 each. Mount your tanks on a single-point hanger, attach the strain gages, and connect them to your PLC. Ensure you have a 10 or 12 VDC supply for the strain gages.

With a LIW feeder, you can set up an initial routine to input the starting weight of each tank into the PLC. Then, program the LIW routine for a specific amount of dye or water to be fed. Open the solenoid for water or dye and monitor the weight by comparing it to the initial reading. Once the desired weight is reached, close the solenoid to control the flow accurately. This cost-effective method can greatly enhance your mix accuracy.</p>

            <p>Lancie1 suggested a cost-effective way to enhance mix accuracy by using a Loss-in-Weight system with load cells or strain gages connected to a PLC. The strain gages are reasonably priced (around $31 each), and setting up the system involves attaching them to the tanks and connecting to the PLC. This setup allows for precise measurement of dye or water being gravity fed, ensuring accurate mixing. By following an initial setup routine and monitoring weight changes, users can control the flow of dye or water with solenoids. This innovative approach offers a new method of control and direction for improving mixing processes.</p>

            <p>Are you considering creating a tablet dispenser for your project? Picture a sleek design where tablets are neatly stacked in a cylindrical container with a bottom cover and slot. Imagine a solenoid-operated pusher that smoothly dispenses one tablet at a time. However, keep in mind that when using tablets, your color options may be limited compared to using liquid dye. 

In addition, while accuracy in color concentration may not be top priority initially, there are plans to fine-tune the system in the future. Potential adjustments could include incorporating visual control elements to ensure consistency in batch production.

The concept involves utilizing the tablet dispenser to add tablets to ingredient tanks once they reach a certain level. Subsequently, water can be pumped or gravity-fed into the tank to achieve the desired mix. Although tablets dissolve effectively, there may be some variability in the mixture.

The goal is to keep the system relatively straightforward at this stage to allow for future modifications and upgrades. This approach will enable future project teams to introduce enhancements and refine control mechanisms as needed.

Embarking on this project may be a new experience, with a focus on programming logic and HMI proficiency rather than design and construction expertise. Starting from scratch offers the opportunity to explore and innovate in this new field.</p>

            <p>In order to determine how to create a specific color, more detailed information is required. This may include a chart outlining the use of different colors in varying proportions to achieve the desired outcome. It is essential to understand the ratios of colors used in order to create a color recipe effectively. Consider how the colors will be added - by weight, volume, or using a flowmeter. It is important to note that colors cannot be accurately determined without knowledge of the base colors being utilized.

When mixing paint, a subtractive method is typically used, except when white is added to create lighter shades. For example, mixing red and blue will produce a darker shade like purple. Additive mixing refers to light, where red, blue, and green combine to create white. To establish a proper batching system for color creation, it is necessary to understand the ratios of colors to be mixed.

If you are considering a batching process, a solution is to create recipes based on a set batch size, such as 20 liters. These recipes can be adjusted when a different batch size is chosen, ensuring the correct proportions are maintained. This approach can be easily implemented with the use of a programmable logic controller (PLC). By following a structured system, color creation can be efficiently managed.</p>

            <p>Calculating color percentages for a batch of paint can be a straightforward process. For example, let's say you're making a 100kg batch with red at 10%, blue at 20%, white at 60%, and pink at 10%. Simply divide 100kg by 100 to get the kg per 1%, then multiply that by the percentage of each color to determine the amount needed. 

Here's a recipe for a 60.0 kg batch of Mucky Brown paint using red (21.0%), blue (30.5%), green (25.0%), white (23.5%), and black (0.0%). 

Using the same calculation method:
Red: 21.0% of 60.0kg = 12.6kg
Blue: 30.5% of 60.0kg = 18.3kg
Green: 25.0% of 60.0kg = 15.0kg
White: 23.5% of 60.0kg = 14.1kg
