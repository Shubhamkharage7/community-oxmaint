            <p>Hello mech29, the error message you received indicates that there are transactions linked to the user in question. In order to delete the user, all records associated with them must also be removed. To address this issue, you can choose to "disable" the user account instead.</p>

            <p>Thank you for responding. In order to delete a user, will disabling them first be necessary? If not, how can I go about removing all records associated with that user's account? mech29</p>

            <p>Hello mech29, I don't believe that simply disabling a user account is the best solution. While disabling the account prevents the user from logging in, there may still be lingering records associated with the account. Deleting the user could result in inconsistent data within the database. It's unclear if DSTM 7i offers an archiving tool that safely removes user data without causing any issues.</p>

            <p>At a certain juncture, it is inevitable to have inactive records within your system. It appears that some of these records are bound to be obsolete. Simply deactivate the users or indicate that the employees are no longer in service and proceed. If no one can access the system using the outdated user IDs, and employees are still visible in the List of Values (LOVs), then there is no need to worry. It is not always necessary to attempt to delete everything.</p>
