                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently facing an issue with the logic in a 90-30 PLC (364 CPU). Despite having three Machine Edition backups with different names, all showing Config=NE and logic=NE on Connect, I have tried uploading the logic without any errors. However, the issue still persists as Config=NE and logic=NE. I have checked the validation, which appears to be clean. I may need to consider stopping the CPU to resolve the Config error, but the logic issue is still puzzling me. I am running ME 10.2, and it seems that the older backups were from a previous version of ME. It may be necessary to download the Config in order to clear the error, but the logic problem continues to be a concern. Are there any other suggestions or ideas on how to address this issue effectively?</p>

            <p>In case the PLC program was developed using a different version of the programming software than the one installed on the connected PC, it will be necessary to download in order to synchronize logic or configuration settings. Before proceeding with the download, you can generate a comparison report in the programming software to ensure that both versions match. This report will highlight any discrepancies between the version on the PC and the one in the PLC, providing peace of mind before making any changes.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why am I experiencing Config=NE and logic=NE issues on my 90-30 PLC despite having multiple backups?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The Config=NE and logic=NE errors on a 90-30 PLC could be due to discrepancies in the software version used for backups and the current version in use. It is recommended to ensure compatibility between the backups and the current Machine Edition version.</p>
