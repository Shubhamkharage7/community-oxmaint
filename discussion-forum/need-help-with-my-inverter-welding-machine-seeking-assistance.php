            <p>Dear AMP,

I appreciate your prompt response. As per your request, I will provide more details about the issue I am facing with my welding machine. The Cemont TX 165 Lift Tig Inverter I own is capable of both Flux Coated stick welding and Arc welding. The problem arose when I was trying to build up a bearing journal on a gearbox shaft - the Arc strength suddenly started diminishing. Despite trying various current settings, I was unable to resolve the issue. It seemed like the machine was struggling to maintain a good Arc, losing it almost immediately.

The agents who sold me this machine 20 years ago examined it and concluded that the electronic P.C. board was faulty. Unfortunately, they mentioned that the board is sealed, making it impossible to repair. They also assured me that the machine has a built-in thermal overload protection, ruling out overheating as a possible cause. They suggested replacing the variable resistor (reostat), but upon checking, the existing one was found to be functioning properly. The capacitors were also checked and found to be in good condition.

To improve the situation, I decided to clean accessible P.C. boards with a toothbrush, which resulted in a slight improvement. However, the Arc strength still does not seem to be at its full capacity. Despite searching online and attempting to reach out to Cemont for assistance, I have been unsuccessful in finding a solution. The machine is relatively new and has been mainly used for DIY projects. My admiration for this machine stemmed from witnessing its durability in action at a previous workplace, where it performed flawlessly even under tough conditions.

I would greatly appreciate any advice or help you can provide.

Thank you,
Charles Whittal (Chaz)</p>

            <p>One common issue to be aware of is a drop in line voltage during welding. It is important to check the line voltage regularly to ensure smooth operation. Another possible issue could be a malfunctioning transformer not generating the necessary voltages. Thank you.</p>
