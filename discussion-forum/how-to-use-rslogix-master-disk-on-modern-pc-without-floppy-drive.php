                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Are you unsure how to use the RSLogix Master Disk on a modern PC without a floppy drive? I am facing a problem trying to install RSLogix on my new PC, as it requires a floppy disk in the (A) drive for the program to start. Despite having an external USB floppy drive, it is not being recognized as drive (A). RSLogix appears to be searching for the activation file on the "C" or "A" drive from the floppy disk. Is there a way to make the program search for the activation file on a different drive, such as drive "E" or "F" corresponding to the external floppy drive? Thank you.</p>

            <p>To change the drive location for the activation file in EVMOVE, simply navigate to the initial window that appears when launching the program. Ensure that your external drive is connected and recognized by your computer before proceeding with EVMOVE. If you do not have an external drive available, and your new computer is connected to a network, you can use another computer on the network with an internal floppy drive. Share the floppy drive, insert the activation disk, browse for the shared drive, map it to a specific drive letter, and select that drive letter in EVMOVE.
Alternatively, you can download a version of EVMOVE from the AB knowledgebase that allows you to transfer the activation from a floppy disk to a USB thumb drive, and then to your hard drive. This process provides more flexibility and convenience for managing your activation files.</p>

            <p>I realize now that I need to clarify my issue further. My problem is not related to moving the activation from the master disk, which is what the EVMOVE function is for. Instead, I am trying to use RSLogix on a second computer. The activation file has been transferred from a floppy disk to the "C" drive of my primary computer for copy protection purposes. It seems that RSLogix can be installed on multiple computers, but only one computer can run the program without the master disk. The other computers where the program is downloaded require the master disk to be inserted in the floppy drive in order to run Logix. This is the issue I am facing with my new computer. I appreciate any suggestions that have been shared and I believe they may still hold the solution to this problem. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you relocate the activation from the master disk to the C: drive, the master disk will no longer function on any computer. To do this, access rslogix and select help->copy protections for instructions on adjusting the search path for the master disk. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining the proper functionality and security of your software.</p>

            <p>One way to ensure continuous access to programming software is by creating a shared folder on a server or another computer that can be easily accessed. To do this, each computer with the software installed should have a network drive permanently mapped to the shared folder, such as drive letter J: for consistency. Additionally, the environment variable CHECKDRIVES must be configured with the parameters C and the mapped drive letter (e.g. J). Using the EVMove utility, the activation file can then be moved to the shared folder, allowing any connected computer with the correct drive mapping and environment variable to run the software. In instances where network connectivity is not available, the EVMove utility can be used to transfer the activation to the specific computer where the software will be used. This method ensures seamless software operation across multiple PCs within the network.</p>

            <p>Running multiple computers on the same software license is against the law, as you are likely aware. Remember, software licenses are designed for use on a single device only. It's important to comply with these regulations to avoid any legal issues.</p>

            <p>The software restricts the activation file to one PC at a time. The file becomes locked until the first PC releases it by closing the program, preventing it from being used in another installation. Installing the software multiple times is permissible as long as the licensed number of simultaneous instances is not exceeded. This practice is legal and compliant with the software's licensing terms.</p>

            <p>Thank you to everyone who has offered assistance. In order to address the legality concerns, I contacted Rockwell Automation directly. Once the activation has been transferred from the floppy disk to a single computer, that designated computer becomes the primary one. It is then possible to use RSLogix on this primary computer without the need for the floppy disk to be inserted. However, if you attempt to open the program on any additional computers without the master disk present in the drive, a fatal error message will be displayed and the program will not launch. This situation will persist unless the master disk is inserted. Even though the activation has been transferred to the primary computer, the master disk can still serve as the activation key for an extra computer. Therefore, apart from the primary computer, only one other computer can run the program simultaneously. It is worth noting that some individuals may attempt, or have already succeeded in, circumventing these restrictions by duplicating the content of the master disk onto another floppy disk - an action that is unequivocally illegal and strongly discouraged. I am committed to utilizing the software within the confines of the law. I appreciate the cautionary advice.</p>

            <p>I received some clarification regarding running master disks on industrial products. For products featuring physical master disks, it is possible to have two disks running simultaneously. However, with newer web-activated packages, this capability is not available. Additionally, while Logix products can support two simultaneous runs, RSLinx may have limitations in this regard.</p>

            <p>Of course, the Master disk can still serve as a key for activating RSLogix even if the Activation File has been relocated. It simply needs to be inserted into the drive. Mickey's guidance on the Keydisk and Checkdrives environment variables is proven effective and widely utilized by countless users daily.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I want to clarify that the setup involving a shared network drive that I recommended is completely legal. The activation file is programmed to only allow the number of installations that were initially purchased, preventing any extra instances from running simultaneously. This will result in the fatal error mentioned earlier. For instance, if you have an activation file for 3 licensed installations but have the software installed on 10 PCs, you will only be able to use the software on 3 of them at a time. I hope this explanation addresses any uncertainties you may have.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to jshiepe, the software has restrictions in place to prevent multiple activations. Once one PC has activated the software, it cannot be used on another installation until it is released by closing the software. It is permissible to install the software on multiple devices as long as the number of simultaneous instances does not exceed the licensed amount. If Master Disk activation is set up on Server 2003 with Terminal Services enabled, the software can be run an unlimited number of times. Additionally, older versions of Master Disk software were licensed to the machine rather than the number of seats or instances in use.</p>
