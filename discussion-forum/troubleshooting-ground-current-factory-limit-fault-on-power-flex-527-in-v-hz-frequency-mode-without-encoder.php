                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am facing an issue with my PF 527 setup that uses motion instructions in frequency mode without encoder, with the frequency mode set to V/hz. Whenever I stop the motor, I consistently encounter a "Ground Current Factory Limit Fault" (S 16). The motor is able to start and run without any issues, but the fault only occurs when it comes to a stop. In my experience, a "bad" motor (having a shorted ground to any phase) would trigger a fault as soon as you attempt to run it. So, my question is whether this issue could be due to a faulty motor, or if there are parameters or instructions that need adjusting to resolve it. Could the fault be related to the speed at which I am stopping the motor? Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you disconnect the motor and initiate the same start/stop command, check if the drive still indicates a fault. This fault may be caused by a current detected in the ground path, potentially linked to regeneration. This issue could be attributed to a faulty motor, wiring, or the drive itself.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>This is a fresh installation with a brand new drive that operates without a motor issue. The new wiring connected to the motor eliminates the possibility of faulty wires. Despite changing the motor to rule out any issues, the fault (S16 fault) persists, which is unusual. The fault occurs after running the motor for 10-15 minutes and stopping it.</p>

            <p>On the contrary, the most common cause of motor issues is often attributed to newly installed wires. With just a single nick in the insulation, arcing inside the conduit can occur. Have you performed a megger test on the motor leads? If you don't have a megger on hand, consider running temporary wiring outside of the conduit to conduct a motor test. This simple step can help identify and address any potential issues with the motor's performance.</p>

            <p>The initial step I take is conducting a MEG test on the motor and the connections between the VFD and the motor. Afterwards, I proceed to disconnect the wires at the bottom of the VFD.</p>

            <p>Robertmee pointed out that new wires installed on a motor are often the culprit behind issues, as even a minor nick in the insulation can cause arcing within the conduit. Have you performed a megger test on the leads and motor? If not, consider running temporary wires outside the conduit for testing. It's worth noting that while the VSD and motor are likely fine as they were tested before leaving the factory, the wires from a drum that has been handled roughly for months may be the source of problems. In this scenario, the wires are the most likely component to be damaged or malfunction.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  What could be causing the "Ground Current Factory Limit Fault" on my Power Flex 527 in V/Hz Frequency Mode without Encoder?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The fault may be related to parameters or instructions that need adjusting, rather than a faulty motor. It's possible that the fault is triggered when the motor comes to a stop, so investigating the stopping speed and other settings could help resolve the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How does the "Ground Current Factory Limit Fault" differ from a typical fault caused by a bad motor in a Power Flex 527 setup?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Unlike a fault triggered immediately by a bad motor, the "Ground Current Factory Limit Fault" in this case occurs specifically when the motor stops. This suggests that the fault may be related to the stopping process or specific settings rather than an inherent motor issue.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Is there a specific troubleshooting process recommended for addressing the "Ground Current Factory Limit Fault" on a Power Flex 527 operating in V/Hz Frequency Mode without Encoder?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: It's advisable to review and potentially adjust the parameters and instructions related to the motor's operation, particularly focusing on the stop sequence and speed. Checking for any anomalies in the ground connections or potential motor issues is also recommended as part of the troubleshooting process.</p>
