                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings all, Our company is gearing up for a crucial meeting to strategize on the development of a SCADA and MES system. Currently, we rely on a mix of WonderWare and custom-built applications for our operations. We are interested in gathering insights from integrators, engineers, and technicians on various SCADA and MES systems available in the market. Moving forward, we are looking to move away from our in-house applications and explore more cost-effective solutions. With a total of 15 buildings on site and an additional 5 buildings in different states, the majority of our PLCs are Rockwell, with some Siemens PLCs also in use. While we are considering Ignition for its cost-efficiency compared to WonderWare, we are open to suggestions on other platforms that may better suit our needs. We appreciate any input on the advantages and disadvantages of the systems you use to help us make an informed decision on the way forward. Thank you for your contributions in advance.</p>

            <p>Experience seamless integration with Allen Bradley and Siemens through Ignition all day with WonderWare. Choose to communicate with Siemens devices such as the 1200 or 1500 models over OPC-UA instead of using the Siemens device driver. Engage with older models like the s7-300 and 400 through their driver or utilize KepWare OPC. While the SepaSoft MES may lack polish compared to the IA core SCADA, Ignition allows for direct scripting of basic MES requirements like OEE.

For comprehensive block track and trace capabilities, consider enrolling in a SepaSoft training course. Enhance your Ignition skills at your own pace with the free resources available at "Inductive University". If transitioning from WonderWare, opt for the more stable Vision platform over the newer Perspective release, designed for mobile device compatibility.

Take advantage of the supportive IA forum for additional assistance and guidance.</p>
