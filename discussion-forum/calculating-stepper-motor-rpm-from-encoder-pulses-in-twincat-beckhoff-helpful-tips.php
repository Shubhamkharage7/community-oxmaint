                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I'm new to posting here so please bear with me if I miss anything. I am currently working on fine-tuning a PID controller by testing it on a stepper motor before implementing it on a real system. The real system I will be working on involves controlling a loading rate, measured in N/min, rather than velocity. Given the delicate nature of the real system and my beginner status, I want to ensure the PID controller performs well when decoupled.

To provide feedback, I am converting encoder A input pulses to RPM. Since the real system operates at speeds under 1 RPM, I have decided to use a pulse timing method instead of attempting to measure position changes. Interrupt-based methods were deemed inaccurate at low speeds.

The stepper motor I am using is an AS2023-0J10 model with an EL7047 driver card. The motor's incremental encoder can provide 1024 increments per revolution, but as it works in quadrature mode, this effectively means 4096 increments per revolution. However, tracking the A input pulse only yields 1024 increments, as it represents just one of the four states in quadrature mode.

I would appreciate any advice on how to calculate RPM from encoder pulses in TwinCAT3.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum, GRANDMAST3R5! If you have the EL7047 and AS2023 properly wired according to the documentation, setting up the NC Axis stuff (found in el70x7en.pdf) will allow you to control the motion of the motor using TwinCAT. By ensuring your scaling parameter is set correctly, you can directly monitor the position and velocity of the motor. The NC motion components offer a more precise RPM value compared to calculating velocity in PLC code. The default scaling for an Axis is typically Rev/s, as shown in the manual on page 151. However, when spinning the motor at speeds less than 1 rev/min and considering the encoder's limitation of only 4096 post quadrature pulses, deriving accurate velocity can be challenging. Additionally, the ability of the drive to manage the cogging torque of a stepper design may impact velocity readings, especially at low speeds. For further guidance on using the NC system, refer to the el70x7en.pdf. Good luck with your project! Regards, Patrick.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forum, GRANDMAST3R5! If you have the EL7047 and AS2023 set up correctly as per the documentation, the next step is to configure the NC Axis settings (found in el70x7en.pdf) in TwinCAT. This will allow you to easily control the motor's motion and accurately read position and velocity. The default scaling for an Axis is typically in Rev/s, but you can adjust it for Degrees of rotation as shown on page 151 of the manual.

However, when it comes to spinning the motor at speeds lower than 1 rev/min and considering the encoder's limited 4096 post quadrature pulses, there may be challenges in achieving precise velocity readings. Factors like cogging torque in stepper designs can also impact accuracy at low speeds.

If you decide to explore the NC system further, you can refer to the el70x7en.pdf for guidance. And to address any licensing requirements for using an NC motion system in the runtime, feel free to inquire. Thank you for considering this approach!</p>

            <p>GRANDMAST3R5 inquired about the licensing requirements for using an NC motion system during runtime. When deploying the system for end customers or on the production floor, a license for the NC PTP component is necessary, similar to licensing the PLC component for running PLC code. For bench testing and initial development, you can utilize the unlimited 7-Day trial licenses for most features. Licensing is only required upon system deployment. The TC1250 package includes the TwinCAT3 PLC/NC PTP 10 combined package, comprising both TC1200 PLC and TF5000 - 10 Axis NC PTP functions. If you already have the TC1200 license, you can simply order the TF5000 to add the NC PTP functionality. Adding this license to an actual Beckhoff Controller running TwinCAT 3 is reasonably priced and more cost-effective than purchasing licenses for 3rd Party industrial PCs. Regards, Patrick.</p>

            <p>GRANDMAST3R5 mentioned the need to find a way to determine motor RPM without additional expenses. One possible solution is to set a specific update frequency for RPM calculations. By running a task every second and calculating the difference in pulse counts since the last update, you can accurately determine RPM. This method involves dividing the elapsed counts by the task time (1 second) and then multiplying it by 60 (seconds per minute). It's important to monitor the count values to prevent rollover, especially for tags with limited sizes like 16 or 32 bits. As long as you stay within the proper count range, this approach will provide accurate RPM measurements.</p>

            <p>In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of updating RPM calculations, it is essential to choose the appropriate timeframe for this task. Instead of waiting a whole minute for updates, consider updating the RPM calculations every second to ensure precision in your measurements. By running a task every second and calculating the number of pulses logged since the last task run, you can determine the RPM more effectively.

To achieve this, keep track of the counts recorded during each task run and calculate the ELAPSED_COUNTS by subtracting the LAST_COUNTS from the CURRENT_COUNTS. Then, divide the ELAPSED_COUNTS by the task time (1 second) and multiply the result by 60 (seconds per minute) to obtain the RPM.

It is important to monitor the counts between task runs, as the count tag may roll over depending on its size (16 BIT, 32 BIT). By ensuring that your counts do not exceed half of the tag size, the integer math will provide accurate ELAPSED_COUNTS.

If you are considering implementing an interrupt-based method with millisecond execution for smoother PID control, it is crucial to determine the minimum motor velocity to prevent zero-RPM readings due to rapid interrupt execution. One alternative approach is to use a pulse period/timing method, where you measure the period of a single pulse and calculate RPM based on the frequency (1/period).

By utilizing this method, you can enhance the accuracy and reliability of your RPM calculations while ensuring smoother velocity control for your PID system. Thank you for your valuable input and assistance in optimizing this process.</p>

            <p>When it comes down to it, the most important factor is recording revolutions over a period of time. This can be done by counting at regular intervals as previously mentioned, or by measuring the time between counts which essentially achieves the same result. To calculate RPM based on the time of one pulse, the formula is RPM=((1/4096)/(MEASURED_TIME_IN_SECONDS))*60. However, it is crucial to have a precise and reliable speed reference. Setting an interrupt on each encoder pulse and accurately calculating the time between pulses can help achieve this. In cases where there may be occasional scans without any pulses, the data may fluctuate. As mentioned before, having a low number of pulses can pose a challenge. It was mentioned that this is a test - what will the impact be on the actual application? Ideally, utilizing systems like EnDat or Hiperface can provide a high count per revolution, possibly up to 32 bits.</p>

            <p>The primary source of feedback for the actual application is a load cell, which is used in conjunction with a motor to control the descent of a dead weight onto a test sample through a rod. The goal is to fine-tune the load rate, measured in Newtons per minute, by adjusting the motor speed to reach full load. Due to the small distance from no load to full load (only 0.8 mm), the motor operates slowly to ensure a controlled release.</p>

            <p>In order to achieve smoother velocity control, it is crucial to efficiently pass feedback from RPM to the PID controller each cycle. It is important to note that updating the PID faster than its scan cycle does not have any impact, as the PID only considers the value available at the time of update. Any previous values are disregarded. It is likely that a PID working on every scan cycle is not properly configured, unless the scan cycle is triggered by a timer interrupt, such as every 100ms.</p>

            <p>If you find yourself overanalyzing the situation, consider the number of steps per millimeter you have. Adding a gearbox between the motor and actuator can help regulate speed, ensuring that linear movements remain steady even when the motor is running at a high speed. Do you truly need to precisely control Newtons per millimeter, or is it sufficient to gradually apply the load instead?</p>

            <p>ndzied1 suggests that overthinking may not be necessary in setting up the motor and actuator system. By adjusting the step size and incorporating a gearbox, you can regulate the speed of the actuator to ensure a controlled application of load. Consider whether it is essential to precisely control the number of mm per N or if a gradual application of load is sufficient.

Currently, the motor is configured at 1/8 step, with plans to switch to 1/32 step during testing. Moreover, a 10:1 gearbox is in place, where 10 motor revolutions equate to 1 output shaft revolution. This shaft is linked to a screw with a 1mm pitch, resulting in a 1 mm/min movement of the dead weight for every 1 rpm of the output shaft.

The provided code has been tested so far, addressing the issue of erratic value jumps as mentioned. The code includes functions to capture system time, calculate RPM based on pulse triggers, and manage pulse time intervals effectively. By fine-tuning these parameters, you can optimize the performance of your motor and actuator system.</p>

            <p>What is the scan cycle time and system resolution of your system? If you are receiving 1024 pulses per revolution while running at approximately 1 RPM, this translates to about 17 pulses per second, with each pulse lasting around 60 milliseconds. When the scan cycle time is in the range of a few milliseconds, the aliasing effect caused by it could significantly impact the measured pulse duration. To address this issue, consider using the rising edge of the pulse to trigger an interrupt routine that logs the system time of the interrupt. This approach allows the continuous scan program to detect changes between the current pulse time and the previous pulse time efficiently.

By utilizing the F_GetSystemTime function, you can obtain a timestamp with a high resolution of 100 nanoseconds. A sample code snippet could be like the following:

(* Interrupt routine triggered on the rising edge of the pulse *)
ulint64_currTimestamp100ns = F_GetSystemTime();

(* Main routine *)
IF ulint64_currTimestamp100ns > ulint64_prevTimestamp100ns THEN
  lreal_rpm = (60e7 / 1024.0) / ULINT_TO_REAL(ulint64_currTimestamp100ns - ulint64_prevTimestamp100ns);
END_IF;
ulint64_prevTimestamp100ns = ulint64_currTimestamp100ns;

Additionally, there is a handy timing function FB_SimPastCpuCounterTicks available with a 100ns resolution, making the process even more straightforward. However, it returns two signed DWORDs, which may require some additional adjustments.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about your scan cycle time and system time resolution is crucial for accurate pulse measurements. If you are receiving 1024 pulses per revolution at approximately 1 RPM, you may be experiencing issues with aliasing due to the scan cycle time. A more effective approach could involve utilizing the rising edge of the pulse to trigger an interrupt routine that records the system time. This way, continuous scanning can detect changes between the current and previous pulse times accurately.

The recommended method involves incorporating F_GetSystemTime to capture timestamps with a resolution of 100 nanoseconds. By implementing this approach, you can calculate the RPM based on the time difference between pulse edges accurately. Additionally, consider utilizing FB_SimPastCpuCounterTicks for simpler timing calculations with 100ns resolution, although adjustments may be necessary due to the returned values requiring additional processing.

With a scan cycle of 1ms and system time resolution in 100ns increments, your goal of measuring the time between pulse rising edges to determine encoder increments is feasible.

            <p>Stepper motors operate synchronously, meaning they will move at the speed requested unless encountering pull-out torque. When measuring velocity by counting encoder pulses, I have utilized an encoder card designed for high-speed signals in Siemens systems. By polling the card with a timed interrupt (e.g. every 10 milliseconds), one can calculate the number of pulses that changed within that time frame. The accuracy of this method is dependent on the pulse rate during the time period. 
Accurately measuring the time between two rising edges can be challenging due to factors such as the response rate of the input card, the underlying I/O system, and program execution. While it may seem unnecessary to use a PID loop to control the velocity of a synchronous device, avoid running the loop faster than the input variable can change. Processing the same error multiple times can lead to over-integration, resulting in an inherently unstable system, as mentioned by others.</p>

            <p>In a programming forum, user drbitboy shared a code snippet for a main routine that calculates RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) based on timestamps. The code checks if the current timestamp is greater than the previous one before calculating the RPM. This calculation involves converting timestamps to real values and updating the previous timestamp for future calculations.

Is the variable lreal_rpm used as the Process Variable (PV) in a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller loop? How frequently should the main routine be executed? And how often should the PID controller procedure be called? These are key considerations for optimizing the system's performance.</p>

            <p>In the code provided by GRANDMAST3R5, the 100ns SYSTEMTIME is converted to string format which results in a drop in resolution to 1ms according to Beckhoff documentation. This loss of resolution occurs when the time is converted back to LREAL for rate calculation. The fbGetSystemTime call issued within the 1ms scan cycle retrieves the current time after the rising edge, not the time of the rising edge itself. Even if the code is modified to maintain the 100ns resolution, the measurement resolution would still be 1ms. Achieving a time resolution close to 100ns between consecutive rising edges would require an interrupt routine triggered by the rising edge of the input. Sampling the time of multiple rising edges and fitting those data to a line can improve resolution by "beating down" sampling alias noise. This approach applies a time filter to the measurement, resulting in reduced noise but slower response to rate changes and potentially affecting PID tuning.</p>

            <p>MaxK inquired about whether the lreal_rpm PID PV should be considered. How frequently should the Main routine and PID procedure be executed? It seems like these queries are directed towards the original poster (OP). Despite multiple posts, it can be challenging to gather enough information from forum discussions to provide accurate answers. However, based on the available information in Post #1 and a recent post by @Manglemender, it appears that the answer to the first question is affirmative, although there may be some uncertainty about whether that truly constitutes the PV.</p>

            <p>When it comes to controlling stepper motors, it's important to consider factors like pull-out torque and using a PID loop effectively. Stepper motors operate synchronously, meaning they will perform the number of steps per second you ask for, unless they reach their pull-out torque limit. While it may seem unnecessary to use a PID loop for velocity control of a synchronous device, it is crucial to avoid processing errors more than once by not exceeding the input variable's rate of change. This can prevent over-integrating and ultimately leading to an unstable system. One way to address concerns about speed is by using a gearbox with a larger reduction, allowing you to achieve the desired load speed. By designing around the desired speed, you can effectively utilize the stepper motor for its intended purpose.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How can I calculate RPM from encoder pulses in TwinCAT3 when working with a stepper motor like the AS2023-0J10 model?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - To calculate RPM from encoder pulses in TwinCAT3, you can utilize the pulse timing method to accurately measure the speed at low RPMs. Given the quadrature mode of the encoder on the AS2023-0J10 model, where 1024 increments are tracked for each revolution, you effectively have 4096 increments per revolution to work with. By tracking the A input pulse, which represents one of the four states in quadrature mode, you can derive the RPM of the stepper motor.</p>
