                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>We are currently experiencing an issue within the Planning Board related to resource requirements for outstanding, dispatched operations with past due dates being automatically rescheduled to the next available date. This issue is occurring while using Finite Scheduling. For example, when there is unfinished work from the current week, the Planning Board indicates an over-allocation of a work center for the current date (which is not permitted in Finite Scheduling). If the Planner attempts to reschedule a job for the following week, it defaults to a future date instead of the desired date (Monday). We are unsure if this is a common SAP feature or if there is a configuration issue within the Planning Board. Has anyone else faced a similar problem? Thank you.</p>

            <p>This is a typical scenario in SAP where work scheduling can be affected once a job has started. Each operation in SAP is assigned a specific amount of work and duration for completion. SAP assumes continuous work from start to finish and does not allow splitting work at the work center level. However, if the duration of an operation does not allow enough time to complete the remaining work in the next period, SAP may overload the work center and schedule the remaining work in zero hours. To avoid this issue, it is necessary to extend the duration of the operation into the new period to ensure adequate time for completion. In practice, it is common to encounter additional work beyond the originally requested scope, which may require creating new operations with updated hours and duration. Additionally, new operations may be created for work that needs to be split and completed in multiple non-continuous periods. Some companies have implemented user exits to automate this process. Andrew Barnard, your insights on this matter would be appreciated.</p>
