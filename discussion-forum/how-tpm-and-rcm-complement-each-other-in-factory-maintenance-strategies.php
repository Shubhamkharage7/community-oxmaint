            <p>Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) work hand in hand to improve equipment reliability and productivity. TPM encourages equipment owners to actively engage in maintenance tasks such as cleaning, lubrication, and minor adjustments, shifting away from the traditional "call maintenance" mindset. By promoting a proactive approach to maintenance, TPM supports a culture of accountability among operations team members.</p>

            <p>A few years back, I had the opportunity to work for a large wood re-manufacturing company that transitioned from reactive maintenance to implementing TPM, RCM, and JIT inventory. The key to cost-effective operations in a production facility is ensuring smooth operations, with everything in place when needed. Machines should operate seamlessly, with shipping schedules aligned with production output. TPM and RCM are crucial components of this process, as they work hand in hand to ensure optimal performance and reliability. For example, involving production personnel in TPM can lead to improved equipment ownership and proactive maintenance. RCM plays a vital role in identifying and addressing issues before they become bottlenecks. Ultimately, successful maintenance strategies require a cohesive team effort, with collaboration between production and maintenance departments at all levels of the organization.</p>

            <p>Hello Mike, while I may not be an expert in TPM, I have had hands-on experience with it in both operational and consulting capacities. Personally, I am a firm believer that implementing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) can greatly enhance the benefits provided by TPM. Specifically, RCM will enhance the co-management philosophy within TPM by defining routine maintenance tasks and contributing to the development of corrective tasks for both operations and maintenance teams to focus on. It will also add depth to existing maintenance regimes and promote further collaboration through joint analysis efforts. By providing a structured framework for addressing performance issues, RCM can complement the TPM process effectively. When considering implementing RCM, it is important to seek advice and understand the associated costs, time commitment, and integration with TPM across all pillars. I hope this insight is helpful to you.</p>

            <p>Hi Josh, we have been implementing Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) for nine years now, as part of our continuous improvement initiatives. We plan to continue this practice for the foreseeable future. While there are various TPM vendors in the market, Unilever has mandated all their factories worldwide to adopt TPM as a key part of their improvement strategy, with guidance from the original authors of TPM, the Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance (JIPM).

We receive support from a consultant and translator who visit us every three months to assist us on our TPM journey. While the process has been challenging at times, the results have been well worth it. Our productivity and efficiency have improved, and our factory now looks cleaner and more appealing. Visitors who have toured our facility have commented on the cleanliness and overall atmosphere, noting that a cleaner factory generally leads to better efficiency.

Adopting TPM has brought about a change in mindset among our team members, leading to improved morale, a sense of ownership, and a reduction in equipment breakdowns. While there are subtle cultural differences between how we have implemented TPM compared to the Japanese, adaptations have been made to suit our specific needs and circumstances. We Kiwis have a more laid-back approach compared to the more fervent working style of the Japanese.

In conclusion, the journey with TPM has been enriching and transformative for our factory operations. I may have rambled on a bit, but I trust that this information has provided you with valuable insights to ponder on. Mike</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, meeting the criteria for Level 1 is essential, but assessors also seek improvements demonstrated through performance indicators such as OEE, MTBF, and MTTR. These improvements can be achieved through one-point lessons, increased productivity, cost reductions, inventory management, maintenance efficiency, accident prevention, environmental compliance, and the promotion of a positive workplace culture. Level 3 involves extending these improvements throughout the supply chain, ensuring not only your factory is fully TPM'd but also your suppliers and partners. To compete for the prize, you must submit a comprehensive TPM implementation report detailing your actions and future plans. This report is evaluated as part of the assessment process. Implementing TPM is a journey that requires significant investment of time and resources, but the benefits are worth it. Mike.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I want to revisit a question raised by Mike and shed some light on the topic. How do RCM and TPM complement each other? TPM represents the holistic approach, while RCM is a specific component. In the grand scheme of TPM, which comprises 8 pillars including Training and Education, Autonomous Maintenance, Planned Maintenance, Focused Improvement, Initial Flow Control Activities, Office TPM, EHS Group, and Quality Maintenance Group, RCM aligns well with the final stages of Planned Maintenance. The decision-making process employed in TPM is applied in Phase 3, with Phase 4 focusing on Predictive Maintenance. RCM seamlessly integrates with Phases 3 and 4 of TPM's Planned Maintenance, showcasing their synergy. Best regards, Rolly Angeles</p>

            <p>From 2000 to 2001, we brought in a JIPM consultant who required a translator for communication since he did not speak English. This endeavor was costly, with the consultant visiting our plant quarterly over a two-year period. He focused on identifying issues, conducting line audits, and providing guidance for our next steps. Our team worked diligently, and thanks to the consultant, all managers were motivated to implement TPM practices. After his final visit, the consultant deemed our plant ready for JIPM Certification. Unfortunately, organizational changes prevented us from receiving the certification. Despite this setback, we are determined to persevere on our TPM journey. 

It's essential to remember that TPM follows a Top Down Approach, contrasting with RCM's Down-Up Approach. Mike, as your plant has achieved JIPM Certification, we would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer for industries pursuing the same certification. Your insight would be valuable based on your experience. Feel free to reach out for TPM training materials related to sales if you are interested.

            <p>MP design, short for maintenance prevention design, is a key aspect of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). Within TPM, there are two main activities known as Inital Flow Control Activities (IFCA) and Early Equipment Management (EEM) that focus on enhancing equipment performance. These activities involve Autonomous Maintenance, Planned Maintenance, and Focused Improvements to address any design weaknesses in equipment.

TPM emphasizes the continuous improvement of equipment design to enhance reliability and efficiency. The modifications implemented by these activities are carefully documented for future reference. This ensures that when new equipment is purchased, it already incorporates these enhancements.

IFCA specifically targets reducing equipment commissioning time, also referred to as vertical start-up time in TPM terminology. The goal of IFCA is to streamline the commissioning process to minimize downtime. By analyzing the factors that hinder the commissioning process, steps can be taken to expedite equipment set-up effectively.

Overall, MP design plays a crucial role in optimizing equipment performance and reliability within a manufacturing plant. Regards, Rolly Angeles</p>

            <p>Hi Rolly, I appreciate your responses. It seems like you went through a similar situation as us. Having a translator can add complexity, but we have full confidence in ours as she has a deep understanding of our plant after 12 years. JIPM is known as the leading authority on TPM in Asia, but there are other options available such as the Centre for TPM. Depending on your needs and budget, different vendors can provide quality products. While larger companies may have more resources, smaller businesses looking to implement TPM may benefit from exploring local vendors or consulting with professionals like yourself, Rolly. - Mike.</p>

            <p>Hi Josh,

I agree with Rolly's point about the importance of vertical startup. It involves a structured, ongoing review process during the planning and design stages, as well as testing the product during assembly to ensure a seamless commissioning and handover process. This is an area we are currently focused on improving, and it essentially involves gathering all necessary inputs. As Rolly mentioned, it includes integrating data from the first 3 pillars to prevent the repetition of errors when building new facilities. Vertical startup also plays a role in standardizing processes and minimizing inventory. 

Regards,
Mike</p>

            <p>Could someone provide a visual representation of your TPM pillar chart? I want to confirm my understanding of the concepts discussed earlier. Is it accurate to say that IFCA involves the processes of hooking up, commissioning, and starting up before transferring to operations? EEM (or MP) seems to cover maintenance planning and development, CMMS implementation, BOM, etc. FI (Focused Improvement) refers to initial modifications made after the transfer. QM (Quality Maintenance) focuses on enhancing staff competency and creating procedures to minimize workmanship and material defects, and to implement precise maintenance practices like alignment and lubrication.</p>

            <p>In the realm of Asset Management, terms like IFCA (Integrated Facilities Condition Assessment) and EEM (Enterprise Energy Management) play significant roles. These concepts encompass a range of information, including maintenance planning (MP), Bill of Materials (BOM), and Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). EEM goes beyond just maintenance, extending to commissioning, trials, and a recommended initial "running in" period before final handover. This should ideally lead to ongoing performance monitoring and feedback for future improvements. Focused Improvement (FI) is more operator-driven, focusing on increasing efficiency and minimizing breakdowns. While FI is not typically an engineering-led initiative, it plays a crucial role in optimizing operational performance.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It appears that the EEM process aligns with the post-construction phase known as Hook up & Commissioning, leading to start up and eventual handover after a successful performance test. The start up phase can span up to one year or until the initial warranty shutdown by the EPCC contractor. It is crucial to gather and share all information collected during this period as well as during the operational and maintenance phases with equipment manufacturers and other relevant stakeholders. The FI may resemble an operational excellence program focused on optimizing performance.</p>

            <p>Hello Mike, I have integrated a popular RCM methodology with the PM pillar to improve maintenance processes in our industrial factories worldwide. When TPM and RCM are implemented together correctly, the results can surpass what either method can achieve on its own. In my experience, the combined approach offers significant benefits by establishing a comprehensive maintenance program that addresses issues related to process, technology, and culture. While TPM instigates positive cultural changes, RCM provides valuable data to support maintenance management. If you would like to delve deeper into this topic, please reach out to me.
