                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Attached is a report detailing a VFD failure in a critical warm room application. The VFD lacks a bypass, so I am exploring ways to enhance system reliability and failure recovery time. The AHU system operates 24/7 at approximately 56 Hz. After a failure analysis by Rockwell Automation suggesting overload or shock load heating, one risk reduction option is to replace the VFD with an across-the-line motor starter. Motor starters have fewer risk-failure components compared to VFDs, resulting in lower failure rates. While there is limited data comparing the failure rates or MTBF of motor starters and VFDs, my personal experience supports this claim. Your insights are appreciated. - Jeffro.

            <p>I completely agree that in terms of component durability, a simple electromechanical starter is likely to be more reliable than a solid-state VFD. While I don't have specific data to support this claim, it is generally known that starters are more robust. Although there may be some efficiency trade-offs depending on the application, it seems that reliability is a top priority. Any modifications should be carefully evaluated. Two key considerations to keep in mind are: first, ensuring that the motor can safely handle the starting load on the power system when using direct-on-line starting. While a VFD may provide a gentler start for the motor, direct-on-line starting can put more strain on the motor, especially in cases of high load inertia or torque, low voltage, or high power system impedance. Secondly, it is important to assess whether the mechanical system can effectively handle extended periods of low heat load. Some systems, like centrifugal pumps or air conditioning compressors, may struggle to operate efficiently at low loads without the assistance of a VFD. For example, York 150 ton air conditioning units may experience excessive vibrations under low heat load conditions due to suction issues.</p>

            <p>I am seeking reliable data on the performance of electrical components such as VFDs, motor starters, and transformers commonly used in AHU systems. While our system is designed to handle a motor running at 60Hz, an unexpected failure has prompted us to consider installing a bypass. However, management is pushing for alternative solutions. We typically have redundant systems in place for critical equipment, but bypass options for our AHUs were overlooked. Your mention of failure data reminded me of a previous incident with a Liebert UPS, where a circuit board failure led to a shutdown and bypass tripping. Despite attempts to obtain specific failure data from Liebert, they only provided generalized MTBF figures. I emphasized the importance of detailed failure history for predicting future reliability, but received no further assistance. It seems that manufacturers are hesitant to disclose true failure data, leaving maintenance groups to create their own benchmarks. Your insights are appreciated. Thank you.</p>
