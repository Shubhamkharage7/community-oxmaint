                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I have successfully set up a project using TIA Portal WinCC Runtime Advanced on a PC station and activated its SmartServer for smart clients to connect. TIA is installed on the same computer, where the Runtime Advanced server also operates. However, I am confused about the IP address configuration for the PC station in the project. Should it match the IP address of my computer's network adapter?

Interestingly, upon testing different IP addresses in TIA Portal for the WinCC Advanced PC station, I found that smart clients could still connect using my computer's IP address. However, when they tried to connect using the PC station's configured IP address in TIA, they were unable to establish a connection. This observation leads me to question the relevance of the IP address set for the PC station in TIA. Does it truly play a significant role, or am I missing something?

To clarify, the IP address of the WinCC Advanced PC station set in TIA is 192.168.10.10, while my computer's network adapter uses the IP address 192.168.10.5. Interestingly, smart clients connect using my computer's IP address (192.168.10.5) instead of the one configured in TIA.

This situation prompts me to ponder the purpose of configuring the IP address in TIA for the PC station. While I understand its significance for an HMI panel, I am uncertain of its relevance when dealing with a PC station running on the same computer. How does this configuration impact the connection process for smart clients?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is not necessary for the IP address on the PC running WinCC Runtime to be identical to the one configured in the TIA project. However, the runtime PC must have an IP address that allows it to communicate with the PLC. If the IP address does not match the project settings, you have the option to manually specify the IP address when transferring the runtime to the PC. This ensures seamless communication between the devices.</p>
