                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Upon clicking on the "RSView ME Station" file (5,242 kb), it launches "View Machine Edition" (version 12) and prompts with the following options: 
1.) Whether to update the terminal's communication configuration with the application's. I choose "NO." 
2.) The application's FactoryTalk System Directory for users and policies will be loaded onto the Terminal. The existing System Directory will be archived and restored upon closing the runtime app. Opting for "YES" continues with loading the Application. 
It then displays the current application's name (.mer file) with options to: 
a.) LOAD Application 
b.) RUN Application 
c.) Application Settings 
d.) Terminal Settings 
e.) Delete Log Files Before Running 
To edit the application and view connections to PLC Display Objects, the best course of action is to choose "LOAD Application." This will facilitate the necessary modifications without initiating the live application in the remote session. This approach differs from using a separate Rockwell application to access a different file for editing.</p>

            <p>In order to access the *.mer file in FactoryTalk View Studio, ensure it was saved with a compatible version that allows for conversion back into a project. Alternatively, if you have the project.APP file, you can recover it with Factory Talk Application Manager. However, both methods require Factory Talk ME Development software and a valid license.</p>

            <p>As many have previously mentioned, a license for FactoryTalk View Studio is required to make edits to the file. If you possess the MER, you can utilize the Application Manager and select "Restore Runtime" to generate a project file. In cases where the program is locked, there may be a possibility to unlock it. A program designed for this purpose can be found on GitHub under the name "pv-unlocker" by Vadoola. After unlocking the file, you may proceed with restoring it. Without a View Studio license, editing the file will not be possible.</p>

            <p>Thank you! It appears that I have successfully opened the application and accessed a Display. However, I found it difficult to navigate further once inside. As I interacted with various objects, I was unsure of their functions. Despite this, I will persist and figure it out. I had hoped to easily access the PLC Object reference, but it seems that navigating through layers of graphics is a common challenge. Are there any simple ways to manage this? Perhaps I need to adjust my approach...</p>

            <p>If you layer graphics in FactoryTalk View, grouping them together can make it easier to manage and locate objects within the "Blob". By using the Object Explorer feature in FTView Studio, users can navigate through objects more efficiently once they have been grouped. While newer versions of the software have improved browsing capabilities, it may still require some adjustment for new users.

Some users opt to create a DIY Multi-State Indicator by stacking objects, but utilizing built-in objects can provide a more cohesive look and functionality. It is important to explore pre-existing objects before customizing them to ensure consistency in design and operation.

Recently, I came across hidden buttons created by stacking objects with Transparent backgrounds and no borders in FTView Studio. This made it challenging to locate them during runtime without thoroughly examining the screen. It's crucial to prioritize clear design and functionality to avoid confusion for future users.</p>

            <p>I understand the frustration. In my previous workplace, we managed 8 machines, each with more than 200 screens. Every screen and pop-up was clearly labeled with "Screen xxx" or "Popup xxx" in the upper left corner, making it easier to navigate. This system of labeling based on screen numbers and associated names proved to be much more efficient. - James</p>
