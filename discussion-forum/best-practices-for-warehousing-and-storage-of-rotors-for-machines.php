            <p>In an ideal world, I would suggest storing the rotors vertically to prevent any bowing. While this method requires a significant amount of space and caution during handling, it eliminates the risk of damage. It is important to ensure the rotors are clean and properly preserved during storage. Another option is to invest in custom-made, sealed containers for each rotor, which can be purged with nitrogen for added protection. These containers can be stored either horizontally or vertically, providing a more expensive but secure storage solution.</p>

            <p>In response to caveman-cheddar's comments, in Philadelphia PA there are numerous refineries that used to store spare rotors horizontally, resulting in balance issues. After sending the spare rotors to a balance shop for verification, corrections were often necessary due to a bow caused by horizontal storage. This led to vibrations increasing over time once the machine was in use. It took years to convince the refineries to store rotors vertically, following API recommendations. Alternatively, if storing horizontally, it is important to balance the rotor before storage and address any bow. When replacing the rotor, trust the previous balance and allow any residual bow to work itself out by slow rolling the unit. Additionally, when storing horizontally, be mindful of protecting proximity probe target areas and prevent them from becoming load-bearing while in storage.</p>

            <p>When storing motors, it is common practice to have lubricant in the bearings to prevent corrosion. Regularly rotating the bearings manually can ensure proper coating and prevent excessive bowing of horizontal rotors. While it may not be feasible for all types of rotors, periodic rotation can be beneficial in reducing bowing when stored horizontally.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Following my previous suggestion, it is imperative to check the balance of any rotor that has been stored, whether horizontally or vertically. For rotors stored horizontally, it is crucial to perform a thorough slow-roll with runout checks to ensure any bow has been eliminated before the balancing process. Any workshop that does not automatically check rotor runouts before balancing should be avoided at all costs.</p>

            <p>In the discussion about rotors, it may be beneficial to consider the practicality of periodic rotation to help limit bowing when stored horizontally. Vertical storage is often avoided due to space and safety concerns, especially for rotors weighing between 150kg and 450kg with lengths of up to 2.5m. One may wonder about the ideal frequency for rotating these rotors – should it be done yearly, bi-annually, or something else? Interestingly, balance checks before installation are typically not necessary, as balance issues are rare. Do you have any recommendations for creating a physical mark to track the rotation of rotors?</p>

            <p>It appears that you are referring to smaller rotors, which is a departure from what I typically work with. Failing to check the balance before installation is a crucial oversight that could have serious consequences. It is essential to invest the time and effort in ensuring the heart of the machine is functioning properly after investing so much time and money in opening and rebuilding it. Neglecting this important maintenance step is simply unacceptable.</p>
