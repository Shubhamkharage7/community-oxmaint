                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I have extensive experience with gas seal installations, but I am currently facing an issue that I can't seem to resolve. The new gas seal we just installed on a re-boiler pump, which serves to reheat the product being boiled off in a distillation column, is causing problems under heavy vacuum. The nitrogen gas flow to the John Crane 2874 Double Cartridge seals on the Durco Mark II 3X4X8 pump increases significantly during heavy vacuum, leading to a vacuum system breakdown. Despite inspecting the seal for damage and finding nothing significant, the production engineer is pushing to replace it. Have others encountered similar issues with gas seals in vacuum service applications?</p>

            <p>A seal serves its purpose but may not have enough evidence to determine any issues. Are there pressure gauges to monitor the seal's performance? It's important to consider the seal's capabilities in handling specific pressures. For instance, a double seal with one stationary seat on each end and a rotating element in the middle may operate differently depending on which seal fails. Checking for balancing holes in the impeller and listening for unusual sounds can provide clues to any potential problems. It's also essential to account for the pressure generated by the product being pumped. Analyzing various factors such as process data, gauge readings, and seal pot pressure can help troubleshoot any seal issues. Additionally, make sure the seal is suitable for handling nitrogen gas, a dry type of gas that could impact the seal faces if not appropriately sealed.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your email, Dave. I apologize for the delay in responding. I have been analyzing trends in our DCS to identify the cause of the heavy N2 leak. It appears that during deep vacuum operations, there is an increase in N2 flow rate, while during normal operation, a high amount of N2 flows through the seal. After discussing with the production engineer, it seems that we are pumping multiple fluids at or near their vapor pressure, leading to off-gassing and vapor entrainment issues during deep vacuum. 

Our double seal in Tandem operation consists of two stationary rings and two rotational rings made of Tungsten on Carbon. The size of a dry gas seal is larger than a wet seal to provide enough surface area for hydrodynamic lift. The seal gland covers the connection port to the seal chamber, which is why I have requested it to be machined to accommodate a 3/8" pipe for a pressure gauge attachment.

By monitoring the stuffing box pressure, we can better understand the seal pressure correlation. While we have calculated the stuffing box pressure theoretically, there may be discrepancies. Balancing holes could help remove gas from the seal cavity, but I would need assistance from an expert in this area for our current pump. John Crane recommends maintaining N2 pressure 30-50 psig above the seal chamber pressure, although our in-house N2 pressure is limited to a maximum of 40 psig. 

Booster pumps have been installed to increase pressure, although their reliability is a concern. The nitrogen gas used is filtered with a coalescing filter to remove moisture and is suitable for the seal. Despite not seeing significant damage, it is possible that the seal faces are being pulled open, causing the leakage issue. For further details, please refer to the attached Seal Drawing document.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>For more information, please refer to the documents provided below:

- Check out the impeller with "balancing holes" on Page 5 of this document: https://www.sulzer.com/en/-/me...ngleStage_E10083.pdf 
- Find out about the stuffing box pressure difference with balancing holes on Page 8 of this presentation: http://peg-az.com/wp-content/u...TAR-PRESENTATION.pdf 

Another option to consider is a throttle bushing, which is a machined flat washer that is mounted on the back side of the impeller. This component helps maintain stable stuffing box pressure by providing clearance between the rear cover shaft opening. For more details on how throttle bushings work, check out this article: http://www.fluidsealing.com/sealingsense/aug08.pdf 

In addition, if you are dealing with high temperatures, be sure to account for vapor pressure in your calculations. Based on my calculations, the Total Dynamic Head (TDH) should be around 17'. To ensure a 30-50 psi increase, you should aim for a minimum of 47-50 psi to be 30 psi higher than the discharge pressure. 

If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out. Thank you, Dave.</p>
