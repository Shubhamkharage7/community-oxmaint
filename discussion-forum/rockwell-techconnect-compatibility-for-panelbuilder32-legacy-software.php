            <p>It seems that he is interested in acquiring the firmware file, rather than just viewing it in PB32. The file is typically installed in a directory on the hard drive, but if it's not found there, it can also be located on the CD in a designated folder.</p>

            <p>Alan_505 mentioned the importance of obtaining the firmware file, not just being able to view it in PB32. In the past, the firmware would install in a specific directory on the hard drive or could be found on the CD in a designated folder. Rockwell's KB indicates that this version is available on PB32 version 3.5. However, Rockwell no longer allows downloads of firmware that old and requires updating to the latest supported version. If you are unable to locate a physical copy, consider updating to the most recent firmware version.

Rockwell advises users to visit the Rockwell Automation Product Compatibility and Download Center (PCDC) website to find the firmware for the PanelView Component 2711-T10C8. Simply enter "PanelView Component" in the product search window to access the full range of PanelView Component products. The firmware for the 2711-T10C8 can be downloaded along with the firmware for the PanelView Component 4-inch terminal types.</p>

            <p>rveez inquired if TechConnect provides support for legacy software. From my experience, I found Rockwell's licensing to be costly for legacy support of PB32 and RSLogix 5. I persevered with the older PB32 version until upgrading all PaneViews to Pluses, which proved to be a more cost-effective solution.</p>

            <p>IO_Rack noted that Rockwell's licensing varies depending on the user's role, with the 'Legacy Support' for PB32 and RSLogix 5 being notably pricey. They struggled with the older version of PB32 until upgrading all PaneViews to Pluses, which proved to be a more cost-effective solution. Furthermore, Logix5 has been removed from the legacy toolkit and now requires a $10,000 license.</p>

            <p>The firmware version 4 was released around 1993. How old is your PanelView? If it's quite old, you may need to download software version 2.4 or a similar version. Upload the program, save it, and then upgrade the firmware to versions 2.6 and 3.2. It has been a while since I last did this, so I'm going from memory. I might not have the old floppy disks or CDs anymore. The latest version released is 3.83.01, as version 3.83 has some known issues. - James</p>

I'm not sure about the exact manufacturing date, but it seems to be from the early 2000s based on the label indicating it's a Series B; Revision D.</p>
