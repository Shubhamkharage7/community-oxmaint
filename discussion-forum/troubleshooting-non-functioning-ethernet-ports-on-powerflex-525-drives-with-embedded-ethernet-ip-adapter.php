            <p>Hello, I am facing an issue with my two PowerFlex 525 drives equipped with Embedded EtherNet/IP Adapters. The problem I am encountering is that the ethernet ports do not seem to be functioning properly and do not receive power. Despite following the manual instructions and seeking support, the root cause of the problem remains unknown. I am hoping to connect with someone who has encountered a similar issue and can offer assistance. Best Regards, Kaur.

Could the issue be related to the Ethernet port on a PowerFlex 525 drive? It is important to note that there is only one built-in Ethernet port on the device. If you are experiencing connectivity issues, ensure that you are connecting your Ethernet cable to the correct port. Additionally, if you have added a Dual Port Ethernet option card, ensure that it is properly seated and check for any bent pins that may be causing the problem.</p>

            <p>I have two drives, so I mentioned ports. However, this caused confusion and I apologize for that mistake. I suspect that my Ethernet board is not functioning properly. Despite trying various troubleshooting methods, the ENET and LINK indicators never light up. When connecting the drive directly to my computer, it shows a message stating the cable is unplugged with no communication occurring. Additionally, the BootDHCP feature does not detect the drive. The drive's IP address is configured to 192.168.1.51 as per the parameters, with C128 set to 1 as per the IP parameters. I have also ensured that the firmware is up to date. Despite speaking with Rockwell UK support and following their suggestions, the issue persists.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Kaurk, you indicated that you have configured the IP address range from P129 to P132. Have you also configured the Subnet mask for P133 to P136? What responses do you receive when you ping the drive? This troubleshooting step is crucial for ensuring proper network connectivity and communication.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Are you experiencing the same issue on both drives? It appears that your Ethernet port may be malfunctioning or disabled. I remember reading about a possible issue with disabled Ethernet ports, but that may have only applied to dual port adapters with online port disabling options. It is unlikely that the 525 model has this feature, at least for the single port version. 

I recommend restoring the drive to its factory settings. While I am not sure of the exact steps, there should be a procedure outlined in the manual or available through tech support. Another option to consider is upgrading the firmware, which can be done through either Ethernet or USB. In your situation, USB is the only viable option.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When the ENET and LINK indicators on the VFD do not illuminate in any situation, it could be due to a duplicate IP address in use. The VFD automatically detects any communication to that IP address that does not match the designated packet for the drive. For safety reasons, the VFD's Ethernet port is disabled to prevent any unauthorized movement. To resolve this issue, try using different IP addresses or consider using BootP. Make sure that the MAC address is accurate to ensure proper communication.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all the suggestions! I have configured the gateway to 255.255.255.0. When I ping the drive, I receive a message indicating a 100% loss rate. When connecting the drive directly to my PC, I receive a "Network cable unplugged" message in Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections, indicating that the network adapter does not detect a connection. I am currently using the latest firmware version 4.xxx, but I plan to factory reset the drive on Monday and downgrade the firmware. It is mentioned in the manual that the indicator lights should be on, but currently they do not light up and there is no connection. It appears to me that the port may be switched off. The cabling has been verified to be correct and the situation remains the same regardless of whether a switch is used or not.</p>

            <p>To troubleshoot drive issues, first disconnect the drive controller from the power section and check the pins on both components. Ensure you are connected to the Ethernet port and not the DSI port by swapping the cables if needed. Verify the voltage specified on the drive sticker and compare it to the actual voltage being supplied. Additionally, be sure to power cycle the drive for any parameter changes to be implemented successfully.</p>

            <p>Kaurk mentioned that they set the gateway to 255.255.255.0, emphasizing the importance of setting the correct subnet. Before troubleshooting further, it is recommended to disable Wi-Fi on the laptop and ensure that it is using a fixed IP address on the appropriate subnet for the hardwired NIC. Use the command ipconfig /all for verification.</p>

In my setup, I had a 525 unit as the master and 4M drives connected as daisy chain slaves. The problem I faced was related to configuring the correct parameters. I have included snippets from the manual in a word file that outlines the correct settings needed. For the 525 master unit, the following parameters need to be set: C169 [Multidrive Address] 2, Ethernet IPC171 Drive 1 address 1, Drive 2 address 2, Drive 3 address 3, Drive 4 address 4, and Drive number 4.</p>
