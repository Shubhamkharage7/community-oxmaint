            <p>Hello! You may find the information below valuable. The API 682 Standard specifies shaft sealing requirements for centrifugal and rotary pumps, emphasizing a minimum three years of continuous service to meet emission standards. Could you kindly provide us with a name to address you by? Using a more identifiable name would be appreciated, as "3msa" is not very informative and you have not included your signature.</p>

            <p>When it comes to ensuring product reliability, it's important to focus on specifying reliability from the start. This involves carefully selecting design requirements, conducting thorough inspections, and rigorous testing. Additionally, negotiating contracts that include long-duration warranty provisions can help incentivize manufacturers to prioritize reliability in their products by making failures more costly. This approach ultimately encourages manufacturers to deliver more reliable products that meet the expectations of customers.</p>

            <p>Achieving three years of continuous running for pumps and shaft seals as per API 682 standards can be quite a challenging task. Many may wonder if it is truly attainable at most sites. When it comes to incorporating reliability into design requirements, valuable insights can be found in the dependability standards available on www.iec.com and www.barringer1.com. Some noteworthy standards include: IEC 60300-1 (Dependability management systems), IEC 60300-2 (Guidelines for product design and development), IEC 60300-3-1 (Analysis techniques for dependability), IEC 60300-3-2 (Collection of dependability data), IEC 60300-3-3 (Life cycle costing), IEC 60300-3-4 (Specification of dependability requirements), and more. These standards cover various aspects such as reliability performance, maintainability, availability, maintenance support, and risk analysis of technological systems. Additionally, guidelines for reliability test conditions, preventive maintenance programs, and integrated logistic support are also provided. By following these standards, companies can enhance the performance, quality, safety, and reliability of their products while reducing costs. For those looking to improve dependability, these standards offer valuable tools and methodologies for achieving optimal results.</p>

            <p>Josh and Pete, applying API 682 is crucial as it is a standard that can greatly improve maintenance practices. Unfortunately, many designers and maintainers are unaware of its existence. It is essential to raise awareness about API 682 to elevate maintenance to a scientific level. Just like Toyota warranties paintwork for up to 6 years, or even lifetime, pump manufacturers should consider similar guarantees. This would encourage users to operate and maintain equipment with more care and discipline. Volkswagen conducts rigorous tests, including destructive ones, to ensure the reliability of their automobiles. We should demand the same level of reliability from vendors, design, and construction contractors, even if enforcement may be challenging. Adhering to specific design codes is important, but ensuring every step is followed depends on the contractor's reputation and integrity, not just legal recourse. Thank you, Josh, for compiling a list of valuable standards that can benefit forum members.</p>

            <p>John, I would like to share with you a key practice we used to implement during my time working on TPM activities, known as Initial Flow Control Activities. This practice is considered one of the essential pillars of TPM. Essentially, this pillar focuses on making improvements and modifications to equipment in order to enhance its performance and address any design weaknesses. These enhancements are typically carried out by maintenance, operations, and other cross-functional teams. The results of these improvements are documented and discussed with equipment vendors for future reference. This ensures that any future purchases of the same equipment will already include the necessary modifications.</p>

            <p>I concur with Rolly that utilizing a thorough method is crucial to guarantee that all enhancements are integrated into the new setup.

            <p>Are you in need of expert packaging equipment for your business? While using commercially-available products may seem safe, the unique assembly of this equipment presents new challenges. Based on my experience with other machinery, I anticipate encountering failures in the following ways: 1. Misapplication of parts, such as using the wrong pump shaft seal for a specific job. 2. Omissions in design, like forgetting to include a necessary shaft coupling on an RVDT, leading to repeated failures. 3. Poor design choices, such as mounting a 5 hp gear pump on a sheet metal base, making shaft alignment difficult. Have you ever conducted RCM audits to identify and address these issues with new equipment?</p>

            <p>When it comes to ensuring the reliability of new equipment, four key areas play a crucial role: design, installation, operation & environment, and maintenance. Generally, suppliers have a significant influence on the design and installation aspects, while we take charge of the operation and maintenance sides. However, it can be challenging to persuade suppliers to commit to reliability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) due to their lack of information on equipment performance and maintenance practices. As a supplier, agreeing to a guarantee like "this machine will not fail more than 3 times in the first 5 years" may come with conditions such as limiting usage hours, load capacity, and specific maintenance tasks. These conditions may seem excessive, but it's essential to negotiate solid warranty agreements to ensure equipment reliability.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Hello John, I appreciate all the valid points you have raised. It is crucial to ensure that every part in a machine is correctly applied to its intended purpose and design specifications. When components are misapplied, such as using the wrong pump shaft seal, or when parts are not applied at all, like failing to install a necessary shaft coupling, it can lead to issues like fragile glass bearings. Additionally, impractical designs, such as mounting a 5 hp gear pump on a flimsy sheet metal base, can make maintenance tasks like laser shaft alignment more difficult.

It is important to hold vendors accountable for the performance of their machines. While it may be challenging to demand a flawless operation for a specific period of time, such as 18, 24, or 36 months, it is essential to establish clear expectations in the contract. Vendors may include conditions like raw material quality and maintenance practices as part of the warranty agreement. By enforcing discipline on the user through contractual terms, it can help ensure reliable machine performance.

Instead of attempting to conduct Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) independently without thorough knowledge of the machine, it is preferable to have vendors handle this task and provide guidelines for operational and maintenance practices. This approach can streamline the process and clarify vendor expectations for machine performance.</p>
