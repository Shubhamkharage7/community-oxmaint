            <p>The decision on whether to use an interposing relay depends on the power consumption of your solenoid coil and the output rating of your IO module. Utilizing an interposing relay, particularly for controlling inductive loads, is often seen as a cost-effective precaution. Even if your output Amp rating surpasses the solenoid coil's amperage needs, installing a relay is a wise choice. It is more affordable and simpler to replace a relay than it is to replace an output module. This additional layer of protection can save you time and money in the long run.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When making a decision regarding solenoid control, it is crucial to have specific data on hand. Firstly, you should know the inrush and holding current of the solenoid. Secondly, you must ensure that the current rating of the PLC output module exceeds that of the solenoid. For larger solenoids, an interposing relay may be necessary. It is important to note that some PLC output modules share a common group of outputs and have limits on simultaneous usage. Consider the frequency at which the solenoid needs to be activated and deactivated, especially when using a contact output module. Transistor output modules typically have higher ratings for actuations compared to contact outputs due to their lack of moving parts.</p>

            <p>To ensure proper functioning and avoid damage, it is crucial to follow these guidelines: Never connect anything other than an indicator light or a relay to a PLC output. It is recommended to use interposing relays for all devices controlled by a PLC. For instance, when installing a 16 output card, ensure to also incorporate 16 relays and sockets and allocate sufficient space in the panel. These small relays with bases are cost-effective at just $30 each, making them a practical alternative to replacing a faulty PLC card. Additionally, it is advisable to not directly wire field devices on machinery to a PLC input. Instead, route them through relays to provide clean control panel power to the PLC, reducing the risk of incorrect wiring that could potentially result in sending high voltage to a low voltage input terminal.</p>

            <p>I_Automation strongly advises against wiring anything other than an indicator light or a relay to a PLC output to prevent damage. In a scenario where our output was driving a hydraulic solenoid within the output limits, frequent operation caused the output to fail within a couple of years. Implementing interposing relays on all outputs proved to be a cost-effective solution, saving the customer from purchasing another module. It is crucial to plan for the additional space required for relays when designing controls to ensure long-term reliability.</p>

            <p>Looking for advice on wiring four solenoid valves to a single output channel of a PLC? The valves will operate simultaneously, each with a current of 15mA. Visit www.plctalk.net to join the discussion.

Before proceeding, consider the rating and type of the output. Depending on factors like cost, frequency of operation, and whether it is solid-state or relay output, the feasibility of this setup may vary. Keep in mind the switching cycles and mechanical ratings of the output to make an informed decision.

To ensure protection, consider using solenoid connectors with back EMF diodes and additional diodes and MOVs inside the box. Relays can also be a viable alternative for added security. Explore different perspectives before making a final decision.</p>

            <p>The utilization of interface relays in panel construction is a fascinating topic. I have observed numerous panels constructed with interface relays being controlled by relay output cards. Interestingly, the relays on these pc boards had only slightly higher current-handling capacities than the relay outputs on the cards. Most of these setups involved driving 24v solenoids with relatively low current requirements. Despite encountering some problems, I found that simply bypassing the relays (due to unavailability) did not impact the performance of the output cards, which remained problem-free throughout the 20 years of service.

In our facility, we operated 14 pack sealers, primarily Mitsubishi models with a couple of Siemens and AB SLC machines. Each machine utilized relay output technology, completing 55 operations per minute for 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Remarkably, this workload far exceeded the specified capabilities of the relays on the PLCs. Surprisingly, we only experienced one output failure in the span of two decades, despite the lack of diode protection for the outputs that drove a variety of equipment, including solenoids, contactors, and VFDs.

When the factory closed and the equipment was sold, I discovered that the pack sealers and other machines had been operational for at least 7 years before my involvement. Although it seemed like they operated for only 10 hours daily, they functioned without major issues.</p>

            <p>BryanG commented that a man with a flexible budget should provide a suitable quote for the job. It is crucial to install what the customer has paid for. Parky shared his thoughts on panels using interface relays driven by relay output cards. Many of these setups had relays with a slightly higher current handling capacity than the relay outputs. This setup often involved driving solenoids with a low current draw. However, a potential issue arises when a customer decides to add a larger component, such as a 40HP contactor to run an exhaust blower. This can lead to problems if the new component requires more power than the system can handle, resulting in a call to the maintenance team for assistance.</p>

            <p>When providing a quote for a job, it is important to ensure accuracy and quality. Once the customer has paid for the services, it is crucial to install exactly what they have paid for. One common concern that arises in the field is when customers request additional components or modifications after the initial installation.

For example, a customer may ask for a 40HP contactor to be wired to a solenoid in order to operate an exhaust blower on the roof. However, it is essential to consider the electrical requirements of such additions to prevent any issues down the line. In a situation I experienced at a plant with SLC500 systems, the inrush of power caused damage to the outputs connected to valve solenoids on hydraulic presses.

To avoid such issues, we implemented interposing relays in the system to protect the equipment. It is vital to ensure that all components are suitable for the specific application to prevent any damage or malfunction. Remember, proper installation and maintenance are key to the longevity of industrial equipment.</p>

            <p>One concern I have encountered in the field is the possibility of customers requesting additional equipment to be added to their machines without considering the electrical requirements. For example, a customer asking for a 40HP contactor to be wired to a tiny solenoid in the machine to activate an exhaust blower on the roof. The miscalculation of power consumption, such as the 3A rating for the 24V 40HP contactor coil combined with the 25mA for the solenoid, can lead to problems like the machine not being able to run without the necessary chemical supply. It is important for customers to understand the implications of adding new components to their machinery, as it can result in unexpected costs and potentially impact the overall functionality of the equipment. This is a factor that businesses must consider when quoting jobs, as miscommunications and additional requirements from customers can lead to lost opportunities and increased expenses.</p>

            <p>There are many factors to consider when determining the output of a PLC. Are you using a relay or solid state output? What is the output capacity - is it AC or DC? If it's DC, make sure to use a reversing bias diode terminal, and if it's AC, opt for an RC type terminal. How much holding capacity and inrush does the solenoid have? A good rule of thumb is to multiply the holding current by 6 to 10 for the inrush if not specified. These considerations are crucial for optimizing performance.</p>
