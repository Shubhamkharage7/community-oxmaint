            <p>The "cm" designation may not be exclusive to Japanese manufacturers, as it is used for motors that require low noise levels. SKF, for example, considers a C3 clearance to be similar numerically. However, comparing actual clearances reveals subtle distinctions. Visit http://www.snhbearings.com/set_info.htm for more information on clearances.</p>

            <p>Hello JOHN FROM PA, it's important to note that "CM" and "C3" have distinct measurements. I am searching for the specific equivalent. Additionally, could you provide information on the minimum and maximum values in the internal clearance table? This suggests that internal clearance varies within a range rather than having a fixed value.</p>

            <p>Hello JOHN FROM PA, when comparing "CM" and "C3," it's important to note that they have different measurements. I am in search of the precise equivalent. Can you provide information on the minimum and maximum values in the internal clearance table? It seems that internal clearance does not have a fixed value but rather a range. This variation is expected in manufacturing processes due to tolerances. For example, in table 7.1, CM clearance ranges from 12 to 22 um for bore sizes between 50-80 mm. If you require a different clearance within a similar range but not labeled as CM, consult another table for a comparable option, such as "nominal" with a range of 8 to 28 um for a 50mm shaft. Keep in mind that an exact match may not be available, which is why the CM class exists. As a side note, I collaborate with a bearing manufacturer that offers CM bearings, which are standard bearings carefully chosen to meet CM clearance specifications.</p>
