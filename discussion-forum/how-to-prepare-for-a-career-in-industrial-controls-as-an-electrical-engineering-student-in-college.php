                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I will be entering my senior year as an Electrical Engineering (EE) student next fall, with the goal of pursuing a career in industrial controls as a system integrator. This summer, I have been immersing myself in theacademycourse offered by myplctraining.com, gaining valuable experience with Rockwell software. While I have not previously worked in a technical role, my exposure to industrial automation equipment has been limited to handling packages at a UPS sorting facility. Additionally, my experience with power tools has been limited to home use.

I am eager to gain hands-on experience this summer and continue part-time into the fall. Can anyone recommend companies, both in terms of size and services provided, where I can start gaining experience in this field? If you started your career with no industry experience like me, how did you navigate this transition? What was expected of you as a beginner?

I appreciate any advice you can provide. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>One valuable suggestion is to look for a panel shop that offers part-time opportunities for building panels. This hands-on experience in connecting and wiring components is essential for successfully commissioning and troubleshooting systems. The ability to transition between schematics and wiring diagrams, and to envision them in a real-world setting, is a crucial skill to develop.</p>

            <p>I highly recommend honing your programming skills and showcasing your proficiency during interviews. While you may not be required to physically write code during the interview, discussing past programming projects will greatly benefit you. Whether it was for school or a personal hobby, having programming experience can set you apart. Even though Systems Integrators (SIs) may not use traditional programming languages, the basics remain the same across all languages. Some Electrical Engineers (EEs) I have worked with lacked programming experience due to their hardware-focused background, which is perfectly fine. However, it is important for a typical SI to have programming knowledge. Demonstrating your well-rounded skills as an engineering student will definitely leave a positive impression.</p>

            <p>In the realm of panel building, is it common for panel builders to travel for work? How can one locate panel builders in their vicinity? Additionally, is it possible to pursue a career as a panel builder without having to travel extensively? Typically, panel builders work on constructing panels at their own facilities rather than traveling to customer sites. While installation may require some travel, larger companies often have separate teams for this task.</p>

            <p>One potential pathway to consider is gaining experience within a maintenance department through an internship. This opportunity has been pursued by several individuals in the past. Acquiring knowledge on the functioning of equipment and the methods used by technicians to diagnose and repair issues will greatly benefit your future professional endeavors. Being equipped with the ability to confidently explain technical malfunctions, such as a faulty sensor, is far more advantageous when compared to being caught off guard with uncertainty. It is also beneficial if the machinery itself can indicate such issues on a Human-Machine Interface (HMI). A successful program typically focuses on efficiently managing unexpected challenges, rather than solely optimizing routine production processes. It is imperative to understand potential malfunctions in order to effectively plan and address them when they arise.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to work part-time building panels, consider finding a panel shop that offers this opportunity. However, avoid getting stuck in production roles. Working for a system integrator is a great option as it allows you to install systems in the field, offering exposure to a variety of machines and programming skills. It is essential to have the ability to program and understand how machinery operates for this role.</p>

            <p>I recommend considering pursuing a position in the maintenance department of a manufacturing company to gain hands-on experience with the components your Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) will interact with. Alternatively, studying the Automation Direct catalog can provide insights into the various components that your PLC programs will communicate with and regulate. This will help you gain a better understanding of how to effectively program and maintain your PLC system.</p>
