            <p>Inquiring about the catalog number, are you checking for a reading of 120VAC between the top 2 terminals of the bottom terminal strip (VAC L1 to VAC L2/N)? If so, and the connection is secure, it is possible that the unit is non-functional. It was purchased second-hand from an individual and was previously used in a car wash until January of this year. Any suggestions on how to determine if the unit is beyond repair, either through internal inspection or other means, would be appreciated. The catalog number is 1766-L32BWA, and there is a confirmed 120V reading between VAC L1 and VAC N.</p>

            <p>After examining the board and discovering no continuity between the solder points, I suspect a faulty fuse is the issue. Considering the potential for a short circuit in the programmable logic controller (PLC), is it worth the effort to desolder and replace the fuse? I am concerned that replacing the fuse may just lead to another blown fuse due to a hidden short circuit.</p>

            <p>lukethorwart inquired about testing a fuse and whether it is possible to replace it with a linear fuse that can be checked for continuity between the inlet and outlet. To test the fuse, you can jump it out, power it up, and observe the results. It is important to find the rating of the fuse and use one with the same rating in your power wire set-up. This approach may not worsen the situation.</p>

            <p>When faced with a power issue in your setup, saultgeorge suggests trying to jump-start it and see if that solves the problem. Check the fuse rating and make sure to replace it with one of the same rating in your power wire setup. It's worth a try to improve the situation, right? If you're unsure how to jump-start it, the solution may lie in soldering to two points on the back of the board.</p>

            <p>It is not advisable to bypass the fuse without understanding the root cause of the issue. It is recommended to follow GIT's guidance and seek a replacement for the blown fuse. If you are determined to troubleshoot the issue, consider soldering in a new fuse or connecting wires to the fuse spots. Attach the wires to a glass fuse holder for testing purposes.</p>

            <p>I successfully revived a malfunctioning ML (potentially a 1400 or 1500 model) by troubleshooting and fixing its internal circuit board. The board featured 6 connections for incoming power - 2 each for hot, neutral, and ground. Upon inspection, I discovered traces running between these connections and the pins on the lower board with the power supply. The multi-layer circuit board revealed hidden traces sandwiched between its layers, with one visible hot trace on top and a ground trace on the bottom.

After identifying a fuzzy smoke inside the board's neutral trace, I suspected a manufacturing issue from a possible Rockwell Detroit circuit board supplier. To resolve the problem, I soldered a wire from the incoming neutral terminals to the back of the board, resulting in a fully functional PLC. This repair only cost me 6 cents and an hour of my time, showcasing the power of DIY troubleshooting for electronic devices.</p>
