                    <p>Hello, I am looking to set up a demonstration station for testing various devices and programs, and I could use some assistance. My goal is to integrate GuardLogix, Piltzmulti, and FlexiSoft safety controllers with safety devices such as E-Stops, non-contact switches, guard locking interlock switches, LCs, as well as a motor, relays, and smc/ross valves. I am struggling to find a solution for connecting these devices to each controller without replication. The main objective is to remotely access the station, select a controller, upload a program, and test it with the connected devices. I am seeking guidance on selecting the appropriate devices to ensure seamless connectivity and functionality.</p>
