            <p>When assessing a system, it's important to determine if it's a new installation or an existing one. If it's an existing system that has been functioning well, be sure to inspect for common issues such as loose connections, particularly with shields, drains, and grounds. Additionally, check for any damage to cabling, especially the shielding of VFD and network cables. It's also important to look out for any damaged, open, or improperly fitted enclosures or conduit fittings. Regular maintenance and thorough checks can help prevent potential problems and ensure the longevity of the system.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your responses. This is a new installation, and I have verified that there is approximately 2.5V between the neutral and earth. The PLC RS232 communication is functioning properly, but the issue lies with the ethernet connection. The ethernet is solely used for programming purposes, specifically from the PLC to the laptop. The cable being used is a cat5. For the motor cable, I need to ensure that the screen is properly connected at both ends.</p>

            <p>One frequent issue arises when utilizing non-VFD cable to connect a motor to a VFD, often due to cost-saving measures without considering the potential drawbacks.

            <p>Failure to shield the motor cable with a VFD and running it alongside other cables can lead to the spread of noise across the entire installation. To avoid this issue, it is crucial to shield the cable or route it separately, preferably within a metal conduit. Additionally, it is essential to ensure that there are no floating electrical supplies disconnected from the ground to maintain proper functionality and safety.</p>

            <p>@AB2005, providing a more detailed overview will enable us to offer better assistance. Currently, we understand that the system involves a Fatek PLC with Ethernet and RS232 communications, along with a VFD from an unspecified brand. There are also unidentified measures implemented to address noise issues, but it appears that no proactive measures have been taken to prevent it. It is important to consider factors such as the system's grounding method (TN-C, TN-S, TN-C/S, TT, or IT), the presence of filters or PFC banks, and any prior measurements conducted. Additionally, it would be helpful to know the specific components connected to the RS232 interface.</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, goghie advised @AB2005 to provide a comprehensive overview of the setup involving a Fatek PLC with Ethernet and RS232 connections, an unidentified VFD, and unspecified noise mitigation measures. Key questions were raised regarding the electrical system configuration (TN-C, TN-S, TN-C/S, TT, or IT), presence of filters and PFC banks, and completion of necessary measurements. It was revealed that PFC banks are in place with a setpoint of 0.95 for power factor, while further measurements and adjustments are scheduled. The RS232 connection is linked to an HMI for communication purposes.

To improve communication stability, an Ethernet switch was temporarily added to enable simultaneous connection of the HMI, PLC, and PC. The RS232 link is dedicated for PLC-HMI communication, while fluctuations in communication were noted during inverter activation and motor operation. The ongoing project involves replacing an outdated controller with a Fatek PLC, with the installation of relays, power supply, and retention of existing wiring.</p>

            <p>I hope the VFD you are using does not have a 1x230V input with 3x230V output, as this could complicate things for you. It's important to note that all the advice you received in previous posts was correct, and I will just provide some additional suggestions.

Here is a simplified list of recommendations for better electrical grounding in your system:

1. Use S/FTP cables that are long enough to avoid interference from power cables, or if you must pass near them, do so at a 90-degree angle.
2. Ensure that every ground (GND) on the PLC and its modules is directly connected to the ground and avoid creating loops.
3. Connect the HMI ground directly to the ground.
4. Connect the VFD ground directly to the ground.
5. Connect the shield of shielded signal cables to the ground on only one side.
6. If your grounding system is TN-C, convert it to TN-C/S in your enclosure by converting PEN to PE and N, with the earth connector being at least the same size as the supply cable.
7. Check the grounding of the motor.
8. Install an isolating transformer for the control line at 400/230V.
9. Ensure that the Fault Ground and Logical Ground are on separate wires.</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, goghie expressed concern about the voltage specifications of a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD), cautioning against potential complications with a 1x230V input and 3x230V output configuration. While previous advice received was deemed accurate, additional precautions were recommended to ensure optimal performance. Here are some essential guidelines to follow for proper grounding and cable installation:

1. Utilize S/FTP cable of sufficient length to avoid proximity to power cables, and if necessary, cross them at a 90-degree angle.
2. Establish direct grounding connections for all PLC and module grounds to prevent loops.
3. Ensure the HMI ground is directly linked to the main ground.
4. Verify the VFD ground is securely connected to the main ground.
5. Connect the shield of shielded signal cables to ground, but only on one end.
6. If the grounding system is TN-C, convert it to TN-C/S in your enclosure by adjusting the PEN to PE and N connections, with the earth connector matching the supply cable size.
7. Evaluate motor grounding arrangements.
8. Consider adding an isolating transformer for control line 400/230V.
9. Differentiate between Fault Ground and Logical Ground by using separate wires.

Furthermore, the query about whether the '0VDC' of a 24VDC power supply should be linked to ground was raised. This aspect should be carefully addressed in your setup for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>Absolutely, there is indeed no true 0 volts, only 0V in relation to a reference point, which should be ground. It is crucial to consider proper grounding to address issues like EMC, harmonic distortion, and related concerns that may resurface without a solid 0V to GND connection.</p>

            <p>Hello, I have taken steps to address connectivity issues by ensuring that the 0VDC is properly grounded and directly connecting all components to the ground. An interesting observation I have made is that problems with Ethernet communication only occur when an Ethernet switch is used between the PLC and laptop. Removing the Ethernet switch resolves the communication issues. Typically, I use the Ethernet switch to link the HMI and PLC to the laptop. Ethernet is not required during machine operation, as the HMI communicates with the PLC through RS232.</p>
