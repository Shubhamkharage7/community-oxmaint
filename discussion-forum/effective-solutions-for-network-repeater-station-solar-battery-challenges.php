                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Our plant is equipped with a network repeater station situated in an open field, featuring two ProSoft RLX2-IHG network radios that connect our plant network to a nearby well water pumphouse. Powering these radios are two 12VDC marine duty batteries connected in series, along with a 100W solar panel with a charge controller to ensure the batteries stay charged. However, during the winter months, the batteries often experience a drop in voltage due to extended periods of heavy clouds and cold temperatures. This results in the radios shutting down when the voltage reaches around 10V, requiring a hard reboot to power them back up.

We are seeking advice on potential solutions to eliminate the need for a hard reboot. This could involve implementing a device to shut down power to the radios in a more orderly manner or finding a way to prolong the battery life by either maintaining their charge or preventing voltage drain in cold weather conditions. We understand that this issue may not be unique, but it is a challenge we are currently facing. Any insights or recommendations on resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your assistance!</p>

            <p>The PULS DIN Rail UPS features a 12V battery with a controller that steps up to 24V for optimal performance. This 22.5 → 30V DC Input DIN Rail Uninterruptible Power Supply (240W) from PULS comes equipped with a rechargeable battery module designed for use with a UB system. In the event that the UPS battery is completely depleted, it is important to provide a 24V 'shock' to revive it, as opposed to the standard 12V.

            <p>To enhance the performance and longevity of your ProSoft RLX2-IHG, it is recommended to avoid directly powering it from the battery or solar source. Instead, using a DC/DC converter can offer several benefits. By providing a reliable, smooth, and stable DC supply, it ensures your device operates efficiently. Furthermore, the converter will safeguard against potential battery issues by shutting off the output in case of low voltage levels and only switching it back on once the battery volts exceed a hysteresis threshold. This prevents deep discharge, prolonging the life of your batteries. Consider utilizing Meanwell's DDR-120 series DC/DC converters for optimal results: https://www.meanwell.co.uk/power-supplies/dc-dc-power-supplies/ddr-120-series.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am inside my camper sharing my thoughts. Initially, my camper was equipped with lead acid batteries (specifically, interstate SRM-31 marine deep cycle), but I have made the switch to Lithium-ION batteries. Lead acid batteries tend to experience a voltage drop as power is utilized, charging slowly and being heavy. It is advisable not to drain them below 12.1 volts, as this can reduce their lifespan significantly. On the other hand, Lithium-ION batteries maintain a voltage of over 13 volts even when reaching 80% capacity. They offer more charge and discharge cycles and charge at a faster rate. However, one drawback of LI-Ion batteries is that it can be challenging for the charge controller to accurately gauge the remaining energy, as the voltage remains relatively stable even as energy is consumed. Despite this, the consistent voltage level means that tasks such as moving the slide out can be done without issue even when the battery is at 20% capacity. Moreover, LI-Ion batteries are significantly lighter than lead acid batteries.

In conclusion, I find that my camping experience is greatly enhanced with Lithium-ION batteries. For more information on the comparison between Lithium and lead acid batteries, you can visit this insightful article: https://www.power-sonic.com/blog/lithium-vs-lead-acid-batteries/. By the way, the current temperature here is 15-16 degrees F.</p>

            <p>When setting up AC powered systems with battery backup, I initially used the PULS UB10.241 units. However, I encountered reliability issues with their battery okay relay and switched to using the battery controller linked here: https://www.automationdirect.com/ad..._power_supplies/specialty_modules/psh-bcm360s. This controller operates on a 12VDC battery input and delivers a 24VDC output. RHINO offers alternative models that accept a 24V battery input at a lower cost, potentially rebranded TRACO units.

For solar applications, consider exploring the options provided by Morningstar like the SunSaver MPPT series: https://www.morningstarcorp.com/products/sunsaver-mppt/. Regardless of the system you choose, ensure that your charge controller includes a low voltage disconnect feature to safeguard against battery voltage dropping below a safe level. Morningstar controllers typically have this feature set at around 10% below the rated voltage with some degree of adjustability.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your responses! After reviewing the specifications, it seems like the MeanWell 24V input model would be a better choice for our needs. The under voltage lockout for the 12V model is too low at 8.5V, while the 24V model has a 16.5V lockout, allowing for automatic restarts.

I agree with Peter that Lithium-ION batteries are a great option. Although the boss was hesitant about the price last year, considering our current situation, switching to a single LI-ion battery instead of two deep well marine batteries might be worth exploring. However, it's important to note that our current charge controller would need to be replaced for LI-ion storage.

Thanks to OkiePC for the insights on the Puls & Rhino units. It seems the Rhino unit is on backorder, so I will look into the Morningstar product as an alternative, especially if we decide to upgrade to LI-ion batteries.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to extend the runtime of your radio system, the key solution lies in boosting the capacity of batteries and solar panels. In cases where power is readily available at the water well, consider adding a battery charger to avoid the need for expanding the solar and battery bank capacity, as long as prolonged power outages are not a common occurrence.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>diat150 stated that increasing batteries and solar panel capacity is essential to improving the runtime on a radio system. Additionally, installing a battery charger at a water well with power can also be a viable solution, eliminating the need for enlarging the solar and battery bank. Although preventing voltage dropouts is the ideal long-term solution, automatically restarting the radios during voltage drops can be beneficial in the short term. With power available at the well pump, the challenge lies in the distance to the relay station. Exploring the option of running AC from the pump house to the relay station in the upcoming spring may provide a solution to this issue.</p>
