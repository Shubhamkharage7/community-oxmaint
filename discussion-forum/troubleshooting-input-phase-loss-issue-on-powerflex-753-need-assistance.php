                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently experiencing an issue with a PowerFlex 753 on our site, encountering "input phase loss" errors. This drive has been operating smoothly for over five years, powering a 45kW ND motor for an aluminum cupping press. The fault only occurs during high-speed operation (around 42 amps) after approximately five minutes of running, and has only started happening recently. I have attempted several solutions to troubleshoot the problem, with no success so far:

- Adjusting parameter p463 from the default value of 325 to 400 cautiously, to avoid potential drive damage
- Swapping out the drive for a new one
- Replacing the circuit breaker supplying power to the drive
- Ensuring all connections are secure and functioning properly
- Confirming that incoming voltages are within acceptable limits, with only a minimal drop of 20mA across all phases of the circuit breaker
- Another drive on the same board shows no signs of issues

Unfortunately, I do not have access to power monitoring equipment to track incoming power fluctuations. While there is no filter currently installed, the system has operated without problems for years, indicating that this may not be the root cause of the issue. Any assistance or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you are experiencing power issues, it is possible that your drive is failing. However, consider if any 3-phase equipment has been recently added. It is important to also investigate if there are other factors affecting the incoming power. Have you tried using an upstream reactor to address these issues?</p>

            <p>Initially, I suspected that the issue was with the drive failing. However, even after installing a new drive and experiencing the same problem, I am unsure of what the cause could be. Is it common for drives to fail right out of the box? We have another new drive that we could test out. There have been no changes to the switchboard housing the drive for many years. I have not attempted using a reactor yet, but I will need to see if we have a suitable one available on site for testing.</p>

            <p>If you do not have power monitoring equipment, what type of voltmeter do you possess? I utilize a Fluke multimeter that can be connected to the incoming phase-phase or phase-ground. By setting the meter to capture min/max readings, you can check for voltage drops after a fault occurrence. Keep in mind that some meters may go into sleep mode, but this feature can usually be disabled for uninterrupted monitoring.</p>

            <p>A short while back, I came across a valuable technote from Rockwell that delves into a common issue related to ripple on the DC bus. Essentially, this fault arises from fluctuations in the incoming 3-phase power, which is converted to DC and then rapidly switched to generate AC on the output side. When the rectification process fails to produce smooth DC, DC ripple occurs. In my personal experience, this problem occurred due to a significant variation of more than 2 or 3% between phases. As outlined in the technote, this fluctuation leads to overheating in the capacitors, ultimately reducing the lifespan of the drive and causing it to shut down. While there are other potential causes for this issue, it primarily stems from the input side of the drive. However, the technote also discusses the impact of factors such as a faulty encoder, malfunctioning bearings, and incorrect dynamic brake settings on the DC bus.</p>

            <p>During a recent issue I encountered, I stumbled upon a valuable technote by Rockwell that delves into the detection of faults through ripple on the DC bus. Essentially, this fault is triggered when there is uneven DC produced during the rectification process of incoming 3-phase power, swiftly switched to generate AC on the output end. When the rectification process fails to deliver smooth DC, DC ripple emerges. In my case, this was occurring due to a disparity of over 2 to 3% between phases. As outlined in the technote, this inconsistency leads to capacitor heating, ultimately shortening the drive's lifespan and causing it to shut down. While there are multiple factors that can contribute to this issue, the primary concern originates from the drive's input side.

Upon further investigation, I realized that the problem may not be solely attributed to the input side. The technote also highlights the potential impact of issues like a faulty encoder feeding back into the DC bus, bearing malfunctions, and incorrect dynamic brake settings. Despite my efforts to find detailed information on the DC bus voltage-related complication, I struggled to uncover comprehensive insights.

In an attempt to address the issue, we decided to increase P463 to 650 as suggested, a change that apparently doesn't compromise the drive's functionality. Surprisingly, the drive has been operating flawlessly without any faults since the adjustment, raising some perplexity considering its long-running history without any hiccups. I plan to inspect the bearings the next time we can afford to shut down the system for maintenance.</p>
