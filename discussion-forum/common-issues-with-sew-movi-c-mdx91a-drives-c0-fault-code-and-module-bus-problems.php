                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am reaching out to see if anyone has encountered any issues with the MDX91A drives in their installations. We have a large setup with approximately 30 of these drives that have been running smoothly for the past 12-18 months. However, in June 2023, we experienced our first drive failure with a C0 fault related to the module bus issue. Despite setting all drives as masters and configuring the S3 switch correctly, the drives are exhibiting slave behavior due to a disconnection with the master.

Recently, in March 2024, after a scheduled plant shutdown and restart, we have had 5 drives fail with the same C0 fault issue. These failures seem to be random across the installation, affecting only the SEW drives while other types, like Powerflex and Nord, remain unaffected. Some of the failed drives were even mounted and powered next to each other in the same panels.

SEW has acknowledged the problem and provided replacement drives, albeit on a non-fault basis. Given the challenges faced during the COVID era in the supply chain, we suspect there may be a manufacturing issue causing these failures. Despite SEW claiming this to be an isolated incident, we are curious if others have encountered similar issues. Your insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Update: Last week, SEW engineers replaced all the 'faulty' drives. These units were then sent to the service department in Germany for inspection, but surprisingly, no issues were found and they all functioned correctly once powered up. However, after a routine maintenance power down, two more drives experienced the same issue. Despite attempting a hardwired reset through the front IO terminals and a factory reset, the C0 fault persisted. We have now replaced the faulty drives with spares and successfully powered them up in a non-production machine. Currently awaiting a response from SEW.</p>
