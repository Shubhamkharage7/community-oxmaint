            <p>When updating software, it may seem logical to start with the oldest version and work your way up to the newest. However, this may not always be the case. A common question that arises is, "What exactly defines 'older'?" Surprisingly, version 20.05 could be considered newer than version 26. Due to the erratic pattern of major version number jumps when looking at release dates, tracking down the release date for each version can be quite challenging.</p>

            <p>JJ1234 inquired about installing multiple versions of Studio 5000 Logic Designer. Is it possible to install them all at once or should they be installed individually, starting with the oldest version? JJ1234 encountered an issue when trying to install v30 while v34 was already installed. The system prompted to uninstall v34 before proceeding with the installation of v30.

It is indeed possible to install multiple versions of Studio 5000 Logic Designer. Rockwell Automation recommends starting with the oldest version and progressing to the newer ones. However, installing a newer version first may also work, but some older accessories may not be included in the installation.

One challenge with v30 is that the only supported version as of now is 30.02.02. This is due to the discontinuation of Adobe Flash in previous subversions. It is important to note that only one subversion of a main version can be installed alongside other versions.

For successful installation, it is recommended to follow the sequence of starting with the lowest version and then adding higher versions as needed. Starting with a higher version may result in only the necessary 5000 version being installed, omitting other side installs like RSLinx or FactoryTalk services of a lower version.

If working with versions 20 or older, a serial number will be required immediately for installation. Activation can be done within a 7-day grace period. It is essential to ensure that the required version and its sub-level are still supported by Rockwell Automation to avoid any issues during installation.

To determine the version saved in a PLC software, copy the .acd file and change the extension to .txt. By opening the file, a breakdown of all versions the program has gone through will be displayed. Always ensure that the desired version is supported by Rockwell Automation before installation, even if it has been successfully used on a previous device.</p>
