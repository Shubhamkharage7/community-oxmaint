                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently began a new role where I was tasked with creating a comprehensive guide on Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis for oil and gas facilities. It has come to my attention that existing LCC articles often overlook the importance of accurately estimating costs for future years, such as year 2 and year 3. One approach could be to apply a consistent interest rate, such as 10%, for each subsequent year to ensure a fair comparison. However, it is worth considering estimating all expenses in present-day terms to avoid complications with discounting future costs. In cases where historical cost data is available for the past 5 years, utilizing discount factors can help bring these costs up to date for analysis.</p>
