                    <p>Encountering problems while adding extra Powerflex 753-ENETR to the ethernet module list in Studio 5000 v31.01.00 Pro Edition is causing concern.

            <p>Want to troubleshoot why your drive isn't showing up on your laptop using RSLinx? One common first step is to check the settings on your 753-ENETR module. Make sure the last octet on the card is set to a unique address that differs from the others. Additionally, make sure the firmware on the drive matches the AOP selection. It's possible that the firmware on the drive is higher than the others, so it's important to have all drives at the same firmware level for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>Jim3846 suggested using a laptop or RSLinx to check if the drives are visible. This is a common first step in resolving drive visibility issues. The 753-ENETR may have additional settings, with the last octet needing configuration to ensure a unique address. The firmware version of the drive can impact the AOP selection. It's important to have all drives at the same firmware level for consistent performance. Currently, the drives are not installed, and the focus is on completing the programming beforehand.</p>

            <p>I believe I have found a solution to the issue at hand. Instead of creating a new module by right-clicking in the controller organizer/ethernet, I opted to copy and paste an existing aerator drive. A warning popped up, renaming the pasted aerator to a different name. After changing it to my desired name and assigning an address, everything worked smoothly. With no errors upon saving, I am proceeding with this method. I aim to have the newer drives installed by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. Once everything is installed on the controller, I will provide an update on its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>emomorales shared a successful solution for creating a new module in the controller organizer/ethernet. Instead of attempting to create a new module from scratch, they opted for a copy and paste method using an existing aerator drive. Initially, a warning appeared stating that the pasted aerator was renamed, but after adjusting the name and assigning an address, everything worked smoothly. There were no errors upon saving, leading to plans of implementing newer drives by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. Once the installation is complete, updates will be provided. Are you facing similar challenges with powerflex drive modules? While generic modules function properly, creating powerflex drive modules for any model drive seems problematic. Attempts to copy/paste result in fatal errors when changing IP Addresses. Exploring new module profiles might offer a solution to this issue.</p>

While generic modules work fine, creating a powerflex drive module for any drive model results in a fatal error when attempting to change the IP Address. Installing new module profiles is the next step in resolving this issue. The same error persists when adding PF755 and PF525 drives, causing frustration in identifying the root cause of the problem.</p>

However, he was advised to attempt a specific solution, which ultimately proved successful for him. If you're facing a similar issue, give it a try and let us know how it works out for you. Resolving these types of problems can be challenging without access to the necessary tools, such as those available to the Rockwell support group. Nevertheless, there are a few troubleshooting steps you can take. Start by updating your addon profile with the following link: https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductCompareSelections.aspx?dlpop=1&id=53895&crumb=113. Download and run the file titled "AOP for Powerflex Drives and SMCs (all Logix Versions) v15.01.01."</p>

These types of issues can be challenging to solve without access to the tools of the Rockwell support group, but I can suggest a few things you can attempt. Firstly, consider updating your addon profile using the following link: [Link]. Download and run the provided file, AOP for Powerflex Drives and SMCs (all Logix Versions) v15.01.01, to see if it helps. I recently installed new EDS and AOP files, which finally allowed the drives to install properly. Thank you for the suggestion!</p>

            <p>Jim3846 suggested using a laptop or RSLinx to troubleshoot connectivity with the PowerFlex drive 753-ENETR. Ensuring that the last octet on the 753-ENETR card is set to a unique address is crucial. Additionally, firmware compatibility can affect the AOP selection, so it's recommended to have all drives at the same firmware level. 

I am experiencing a similar issue where I can see the PowerFlex drive in CCW and connect with RSLinx, but the status in the tree remains stuck at "Validating" with no PowerFlex status in the Tags. This could potentially be related to the 20-750-ENETR. Despite being able to connect using other software, there seems to be an issue with the 1756-L82E controller v32.11. Trying different AOP versions has not resolved the problem.</p>
