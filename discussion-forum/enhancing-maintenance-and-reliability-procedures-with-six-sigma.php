            <p>Feedback commonly received is that maintenance data lacks the necessary quality for statistical analysis. While six sigma can be seen as a systematic approach to completing tasks, it may not always be applicable to equipment like pumps that experience frequent breakdowns. I am eager to learn about any experiences using six sigma on data gathered from SMART instruments. - Helen.</p>

            <p>Hello David, I am a part of a company that places a strong emphasis on Six Sigma methodologies. Six Sigma is not a quick fix solution, but rather a comprehensive approach comprised of proven tools and techniques supported by thorough training for practitioners. Without full commitment from management, any Six Sigma initiative is at risk of failure. This methodology can be adapted to enhance any process within a business. Recently, I collaborated with a client on projects focused on improving equipment reliability and defect/backlog management processes at their site. Eugene's success story is notable as well. I respectfully challenge Dr. Spoons' viewpoint - while maintenance data may not always be sufficient for statistical analysis, the "Measure" phase of a Six Sigma project excels in this regard by devising a measurement plan and gathering data on key variables that impact desired outcomes. If I come across relevant information to address your inquiry more comprehensively, I will certainly share it. We are conveniently based in the same city, so feel free to reach out if you'd like to delve into these topics further: matt dot mcleod at swiftdsl dot com dot au. Cheers, Matt.</p>
