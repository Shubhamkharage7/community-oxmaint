            <p>Do you mean "expired" in terms of the expiration date on the drums or certificates of the oil you bought? When mixing oils, it's important to consider a few key points. Firstly, ensure that both oils are clean and free of contaminants by using pre-filters. Secondly, confirm that both oils are dry and free of water. Lastly, make sure that the oils are compatible and that any additives in one oil won't react negatively with additives in the other. Regards, Ali M. Al-Shurafa.</p>

            <p>Abdulla raised a question about the expiry date of drums and if they can still be used if the lubricating properties are still good. It is recommended to review internal procedures in such cases. In my experience, we have used "old" oil after sending samples for analysis, particularly when dealing with large quantities. The storage conditions are more crucial than the expiry date in my opinion. Regards, Ali M. Al-Shurafa.</p>

            <p>Hi Ali, is it common practice to pre-filter lube oil before adding or changing it in the lube oil tank? Is this a practical procedure? Are there any scheduled maintenance plans to inspect and cleanse the lube oil tank, especially in Gas turbines?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Pre-filtering is essential for maintaining optimal cleanliness levels in oil reservoirs, especially for medium to large machines like steam turbines. Setting up a pre-filtration system may be a challenge for some, but it is a best practice that can prevent issues such as corrosion and pin holes. Regular inspections during oil replacement can reveal key findings that may otherwise go unnoticed. This practice is crucial for ensuring the longevity and efficiency of equipment. Thank you - Ali M.

            <p>Hello Ali, I truly appreciate the importance of receiving advice from knowledgeable individuals. I am currently considering the necessity of inspecting and cleaning the lube oil tank every five to six years. However, the main challenge lies in dealing with access and confined space constraints.</p>

            <p>Effective lube oil analysis plays a crucial role in machinery maintenance. The initial step in managing lube oil quality is oil sampling, which is vital as inadequate lubrication is the cause of 54% of machinery failures. To ensure your assets operate smoothly, it is essential to gather lube oil samples for analysis before sending them to your facility and having a reliable oil filtration system in place. The key goals of lube oil sampling include assessing the quality of the oil under peak operating conditions, obtaining accurate data without loss, and preventing contamination during the sampling process. Implementing an online oil condition monitoring solution can further enhance equipment longevity by providing real-time oil health assessments and recommending optimal oil change intervals to minimize breakdowns.</p>
