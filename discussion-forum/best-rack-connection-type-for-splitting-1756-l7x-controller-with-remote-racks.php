                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am faced with the challenge of having to split my 1756-L7x controller into two due to resource usage nearing its limit. While most areas of the plant have their own remote racks, three of them contain cards that need to be controlled by different controllers. Which Rack Connection type should I select on the remote ethernet modules (1756-EN2T and 1756-ENBT) to facilitate this setup? Is it possible to have "Rack Optimization" on one controller and "None" on the other, or do both controllers need to have "None"? Can I set "Rack Optimization" on the first controller and "Listen Only - Rack Optimization" on the second if the second controller only requires input modules on that rack?</p>

            <p>One effective approach is to centralize ownership under one controller and establish a system for data exchange between the two controllers. This method enables seamless transfer of information from the first controller to the second one.</p>

            <p>alan_505 suggested consolidating ownership under one controller and utilizing the produced-consumed relationship between two controllers to transfer data. I am contemplating this approach and evaluating factors such as reliability and ease of migration. Depending on the details provided in response to my original post (OP), I may opt for this solution.</p>

            <p>Is it possible to perform "Rack Optimization" on the primary controller and "Listen Only - Rack Optimization" on the secondary controller if the latter only requires input modules on its rack? The answer is yes, this is the optimal setup. When implementing a "Rack Optimization" configuration, it will take control of the owner connection for all discrete modules within a 1756 chassis. While multi-CPU ownership is not typical, it is crucial to thoroughly document this setup by using labels or creating a diagram near the I/O chassis to clearly indicate which controller owns each module.</p>

            <p>In response to Ken Roach's advice on configuring a setup for optimal performance, it is highly recommended to implement the "Rack Optimization" setting to take charge of the owner connection for all discrete modules within a 1756 chassis. While multi-CPU ownership is rare, thorough documentation should be done to indicate which controller owns which modules, with the use of labels or a diagram. 

Now, what should be done if there are individual discrete output cards in the same remote rack that need to be controlled by different controllers? Would setting "None" for the remote ENBT card connection in each controller's I/O tree be the solution?</p>
