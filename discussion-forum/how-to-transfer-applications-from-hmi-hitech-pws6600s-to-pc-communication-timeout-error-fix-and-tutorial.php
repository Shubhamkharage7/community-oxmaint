            <p>Troubleshooting HiTech HMI to PC Communication Cable Connection

Hello Troizky, I trust this message finds you in good health. I recently received a concern regarding the connectivity of a HiTech HMI system in my company. Could you please provide me with information on how to establish the connection between a HiTech HMI and a PC? Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hey there! I need help with a password issue. I followed Sergei Troizky's instructions, but I'm facing a problem with a 9-digit developer password required to download the application from the old HMI to my PC. Is there a method to bypass this password? Furthermore, if I attempt a direct copy, will it prompt for the developer password too?</p>

            <p>I was previously unaware of the possibility of cracking developer passwords, but never delved into it further as I never had the need for it. It's important to be cautious of the terminology used; uploading is known as "from HMI," not downloading. I have witnessed instances where individuals mistakenly overwrote PLCs and HMIs, resulting in the irreversible loss of unit content after mixing up uploading and downloading processes. I'm unsure about what you mean by a direct copy. It's crucial to handle these processes carefully to avoid any irreversible damage.</p>

Following Sergei Troizky's instructions, I attempted to download an application from the old HMI to my PC, only to be prompted for a 9-digit developer password.

To retrieve the password, it may be necessary to examine the flash memory dump. Despite searching forums for a solution, I have not yet been successful in finding a way to access the password-protected HMI.</p>

            <p>In order to resolve the error message "The Macro failed to open COM port1" on your new HMI PWS6600S-S, follow these steps provided by Sergei Troizky:

First, determine which COM port the PC cable is connected to on the HMI. Once the HMI boots in the system menu, navigate to Confg and ensure the port is enabled and set as the Download/Upload/Copy port. Then, access the port configuration page using PgUp/PgDn and check the communication parameters without making any changes.

Ensure that the parameters match in the ADP Options > Transmission Setup. You should then be able to upload from File > Upload Application, if the file is not password-protected. If a 9-digit password is required, enter it within 10 seconds on the HMI.

If the upload is successful, a .AA6 file will be generated on the PC. This file must be decompiled into a project .V6F file using File > Reconstruct source. Confirm that your ADP version supports the project at this stage.

For future ease, consider activating "Auto-compile before downloading" in Options > Editing options. Should you have any further questions, do not hesitate to ask for assistance.

Good luck resolving the issue with the COM port1 error on your HMI PWS6600S-S.</p>
