While IT professionals may only face a bad day in the office with a potential loss of sales, for industrial automation, the stakes are much higher with the possibility of multiple fatalities.

After reaching 28% completion, it rebooted and displayed the dreaded blue screen of death. This happened repeatedly, with the system attempting to recover and encountering more blue screens. Eventually, after a lengthy process of uninstalling updates, the computer finally booted up to the lock screen. Despite the update still showing as pending, it has failed to install multiple times.

            <p>JeremyM questioned whether legal action is necessary to address Microsoft's persistent behavior of imposing updates. He suggested that the issue might be related to a Crowstrike problem and the necessary access for security applications to function properly. While criticizing Microsoft is common, it's important to recognize that the issue may not solely be attributed to them. Imagine the potential consequences if Microsoft restricted users from installing essential security tools like IDS/IPS or antivirus software, forcing them to rely solely on Defender.

Zensequitur pointed out that today serves as a moment for introspection, as many companies and IT departments may overlook the lessons to be learned. It is emphasized that IT should not interfere with operational technology (OT). Unfortunately, these lessons are often only learned through significant challenges, with the hope that future decisions will be made more wisely.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea claims that the issue with running security applications may not solely lie with Microsoft, but also with Crowstrike. They express concern about the potential consequences if Microsoft were to restrict users from installing third-party security tools, such as IDS/IPS or antivirus software. This could lead to legal disputes and negative outcomes. The preference is for Microsoft to not enforce strict standards that limit user autonomy, disrupt workflow, override app defaults for promotional purposes, or bypass Windows firewall rules for automatic updates. These actions can be frustrating for users and have negative impacts on their experience with the operating system.</p>

This move towards cloud-based management through a web interface was believed to be a more efficient solution.

            <p>In recent years, many companies have transitioned from using local servers to hosting their databases and ERP systems on the Microsoft Azure cloud. This decision was made in hopes of achieving greater stability and reliability through a web interface. However, relying solely on cloud-based solutions can have its drawbacks, as seen when systems unexpectedly fail.

As a user of Visual Studio, I was given a complimentary year of Azure, but found it limiting to solely rely on cloud storage. I believe it is crucial to have offline backups of all important data, including CAD designs, PLC configurations, HMI projects, and material lists, stored on multiple hard drives.

I recall a past experience working in a company where critical HR and payroll information was solely reliant on a third-party server. Any downtime meant the inability to make vital changes such as timeclock entries, promotions, terminations, and new hires.

Just recently, news broke of numerous car dealerships experiencing a major shutdown due to a cloud-based dealership software system failure. This incident disrupted car sales, payroll processing, title and warranty procedures, parts procurement, and overall operations. It serves as a reminder of the importance of having a backup plan in place for critical business operations.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey noted that even car dealerships are not immune to widespread technology issues. During a recent visit to get his truck serviced, he encountered a situation where the dealership's computers were down and they couldn't provide a receipt. The staff mentioned it was a nationwide problem. It makes one wonder if in the future cars will refuse to start until the oil change is confirmed internally for safety reasons, potentially leading to more visits to the dealership for service.</p>

            <p>Ron Beaufort emphasized that a crisis may arise when the majority of stores and gas stations are unable to process card payments. Many businesses lack a backup system and people commonly rely on cards rather than cash. The concept of a "single point of failure" becomes relevant in such situations, indicating potential challenges ahead. An example of this occurred in my city recently when utility workers mistakenly damaged a single fiber optic line, disrupting 911 services for 2 days due to lack of redundancy.</p>

            <p>Arpus4KM mentioned the potential for future challenges in automotive maintenance, where vehicles may require internal confirmation for completing tasks such as oil changes before allowing the car to start. This added safety measure could lead to more visits to dealerships for servicing, similar to how BMW charges for subscriptions for features like heated seats already built into the vehicle. In another example of lack of redundancy, an incident in the city resulted in the loss of 911 service for two days when a utility worker accidentally damaged a fiber optic line. This scenario of insufficient backup systems is common across various industries, with significant investments made in redundant systems for some components while neglecting others. The issue may not solely be due to cost considerations, but rather a broader oversight in system design and implementation.</p>

            <p>During a project, I witnessed a situation where a construction worker accidentally unearthed a communication cable using a digger.

            <p>I believe the problem lies not in a Windows update, but in the ability of a certified driver to update external dependencies without requiring recertification. Additionally, I suspect that CrowdStrike has the capability to independently update definitions, as the certified driver failed to properly sanitize.</p>

            <p>It is important to consider the vulnerability of software that has the ability to automatically update and has access to kernel or root system privileges, such as Windows and antivirus programs. In this instance, the issue was not with the Windows update, but the potential risk of a certified driver updating external dependencies without undergoing recertification. It is crucial to note that any software with the ability to auto-update and access sensitive systems is susceptible to malware attacks from within. While CrowdStrike may have the capability to update definitions independently, it is essential to remain vigilant for potential security breaches in the future.</p>

            <p>Robertmee raised a valid point about the vulnerability of software with auto-update capabilities that have access to kernel or root system privileges, such as Windows and antivirus programs, to malware attacks. While this time there wasn't an attack, the potential risk remains high. It is essential to understand that ignorance is not an excuse when it comes to cybersecurity. Quick downloads of anti-virus definitions are crucial, but failing to test them before implementation is irresponsible and risky. The recent incident involving Crowdstrike and its customers highlights a failure in meeting basic business continuity requirements. This issue is not uncommon in the IT industry, where risk assessments often take a back seat.</p>
