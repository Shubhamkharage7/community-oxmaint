                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Is your company or maintenance department clear on when a formal plan is necessary for a job? I am considering implementing the following criteria: "If the job is not performed more than twice a year." Approval: Supervisor unless the job exceeds 16 man hours, costs over $5,000 in parts, or involves a system design change. In such cases, department manager approval is required. This heuristic is simple and adaptable for jobs of any size. A straightforward rule is crucial to ensure that employees understand when it is applicable. For instance, if supervisors allow electricians to work without a required plan, the policy becomes ineffective. If a procedure is already in place for a rare job (e.g. on the PM form), following that procedure is sufficient - no additional plan is needed. For jobs involving equipment modifications, an engineering change permit is necessary for review and documentation. It is important to differentiate between an engineering change permit and a job plan. Do you have similar experiences or thoughts on this topic? I welcome feedback on any potential loopholes or shortcomings in my criteria before officially implementing it as policy.</p>

            <p>During my time working at a paper mill, we implemented standardized job plans for tasks that were completed regularly, whether weekly or annually. These detailed plans outlined the necessary tools, parts, procedures, and any required post-job testing. The goal was to enable any trained mechanic with the right tools to successfully complete the task, even if it was their first time working on that specific equipment. By incorporating job plans, consistency in workflow and results can be achieved.</p>
