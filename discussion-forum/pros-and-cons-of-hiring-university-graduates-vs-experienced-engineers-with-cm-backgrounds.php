                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, Forum members! I am seeking feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of hiring University graduates versus time served engineers with CM experience. Traditionally, our company has hired graduates with engineering degrees or master's qualifications. However, we recently hired a young man in his mid-twenties with a HNC in mechanical engineering and CM experience. Surprisingly, this time served engineer has proven to be more competent than our previous graduate hires. Have you noticed a similar trend in your recruitment experiences? I myself was trained at a technical college and gained experience through a work placement at the Atomic Energy Authority many years ago.</p>

            <p>As a fresh engineering graduate entering the workforce many years ago, I quickly realized the value of experienced engineers. Investing in a seasoned engineer means you are paying for their years of expertise and competency honed in the field. While a young engineer with a PhD in rocket science may be brilliant, they still lack the maturity and experience of a seasoned professional. What is your stance in this debate? Are you advocating for the development of young engineers?</p>

            <p>Over twenty years ago, I started my career as a graduate engineer trainee. During that time, a quote from my college magazine stuck with me: "Youth often mistakenly believe that intelligence can replace experience, while the older generation sometimes think experience can replace intelligence." This concept remains relevant in the professional world today.</p>

            <p>At Svanels, there is no disparity in starting salaries between recent graduates and experienced engineers. Salary increases are based on merit and performance, which promotes fairness in the workplace. The topic arose due to my new responsibilities in recruitment and training, prompting me to seek insight on the differences between graduate and experienced engineers. While I value experience, I am also a strong advocate for nurturing young, dedicated engineers who demonstrate a thirst for knowledge. It is crucial to support and empower the younger generation as they are the driving force for future growth within any organization.</p>

            <p>Hello Spike, I have a wealth of experience in vibration monitoring. I was introduced to this field when the previous expert left, but I had some prior knowledge of it. During meetings, I have found that younger graduates are typically more receptive to new concepts, likely due to their strong grasp of the scientific principles. In my opinion, engineers who began as apprentices and worked their way up through college tend to have an advantage over those who went to university directly after school. Ultimately, success in this field comes down to individual capabilities and interests. Best regards, Joe Mc Cormack.</p>

            <p>Hello Spike, during my five-year tenure (1998-2003) in training coordination, I have gained a deep understanding of your requirements. I recently conducted a comprehensive case study that compared the company's 'professional development program' (PDP) with my past experience in the 'graduate engineer training' program. I will locate the soft copy and promptly send it your way. It is crucial to properly train young engineers and business graduates as it yields beneficial results in the long run. 

Reflecting back on my own training experience in 1984-85 in India, where I underwent a rigorous structured program that included on-the-job training under the guidance of a mentor, Mr. P.S. Rana. Working closely with Mr. Rana proved to be invaluable, as I shadowed him and learned numerous tips and tricks for I&C commissioning. It was more than just a transfer of knowledge and skills; it was also the transfer of his valuable experience and work ethic. Mr. Rana even shared his own mistakes and the lessons he learned the hard way. 

Warm regards.</p>

            <p>There is no difference in starting salaries between recent graduates and experienced engineers. Pay increases are based on performance and hard work, which is equitable. It is interesting to consider hiring a seasoned professional from a technical online community, even if they do not hold a traditional engineering degree but have excelled in their field. Should their pay be tied to a diploma earned over 20 years ago, overlooking their continuous learning and expertise gained outside of formal education? I personally support the idea of pairing older engineers as mentors for younger ones to foster growth and development in the team.</p>

            <p>Dear Svanels, I want to clarify that my initial post was about young people or those considering a career in CM. In this field, individuals starting at entry level are considered Engineers and can progress to roles like consultant or senior consultant. All staff members are recognized and rewarded based on their level of experience, from newcomers to seasoned professionals. This is a common practice in many companies. How does your company handle promotions and rewards? While I appreciate the feedback from other forum members, I would prefer to keep the discussion positive and avoid unnecessary nitpicking or arguments. If you don't have anything constructive to contribute, please refrain from spreading negativity on my post. I am open to further discussion. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Ganesh, it would be great if you could provide us with the soft copy to share. I am currently mentoring a group of new engineers in the field of reliability and could use some insights from the PDP. Effective leadership is crucial for engineers to thrive, but not everyone has the chance to learn from a skilled mentor. Young engineers are like blank canvases, waiting to be shaped by their experiences. Just a little food for thought!</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After reading a discussion thread, I found myself pondering two questions. It seems like many people advocate for young engineers and emphasize the importance of training them. However, when I look at job advertisements, experience is consistently highlighted as a key requirement. Why do most job postings specify a minimum of 5 years of experience? Additionally, what about individuals who are seeking a career change either by choice or due to job redundancies? Even if you have years of experience in one or two industries, transitioning to a new field where you lack "direct" experience can be challenging and may limit your opportunities.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my opinion, the best choice should be tailored to your specific requirements. If you are open to providing training and can utilize an entry-level candidate, you can potentially help a young individual kickstart their career and gain valuable experience. However, if you need immediate results and want someone who can hit the ground running from day one, then an experienced professional with a proven track record in the field is the way to go. Ultimately, various factors, including your specific needs, will guide your decision-making process.</p>
