                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am the new controls technician at the manufacturing plant. I have received a Dell Windows 10 PC from my predecessor, equipped with Siemens TIA Portal versions 16 and 17. The PC has USB, Ethernet, and serial ports. We have Siemens S7-300 and S7-1200 PLCs with 9-pin ports, as well as S7-1200 and Simatic ET 2000SP PLCs with Ethernet connectivity. Which interface cables should I use to upload the programs? I am unsure if there were any files left on the laptop or if I accidentally deleted them. Unfortunately, my attempts to recover deleted files from the backup drives were unsuccessful. The current PC does not have a file recovery tool. The backups for Allen Bradley and Omron devices are secure. Will I only be able to access the ladder logic without any descriptions on these units? Thank you in advance for your assistance. - James</p>

            <p>The 9-pin port is typically used for MPI connections. You may need an MPI adapter, which can be expensive. However, there are alternative non-Siemens options available at a lower cost. For other connections, a standard Ethernet cable should suffice. To configure the communication settings, look for an icon with a wrench or Siemens logo in the desktop or system tray. When uploading from the 300, you may not see any comments. Make sure to check for PLC files in specific directories, typically with extensions like .S7p in Step7 classic software. Additionally, the ability to edit the firmware version on the 300 will vary. Older versions may require S7 Classic instead of TIA for editing. Remember, LD can provide detailed information on this topic.</p>

            <p>If you're wondering which interface cables are needed to upload programs, James McQuade asked this question. To successfully upload programs, it is essential to have the right cables. For Siemens S7 300 models, ensure they are MPI and Profibus compatible. Pay close attention to the ports - DP corresponds to Profi and MPI to MPI. The software required will vary depending on the CPU's age and model. Some older 300 models may not support TIA. Consider using the Siemens 6GK1571-0BA00-0AA0 PLC S7 USB to MPI ProfiBus DP PPI 32 64 bit cable to ensure smooth operation. It is also worth noting that the 1200 models come with ProfiNet and can simply use a Cat5 cable for connection. By adding the device to your network, you should be able to easily access and manage it. For more PLC cables, trainers, and industrial automation supplies, visit plccable.com.</p>

            <p>While I do offer the CP5711 for connecting to a 300, I believe it may not be necessary for most individuals as it typically costs around $1200. However, in certain applications, it is considered essential.</p>

            <p>Responses above have addressed your cable organization. In the TIA Portal, file names typically end with .apNN, with NN representing the version of the Portal (e.g. 16, 17...). However, simply having the file is not sufficient; you must ensure that everything in its respective folder is included. If your older CPUs were previously programmed using Simatic Manager, you will need to become familiar with a tool known as Set PG/PC Interface. This tool allows you to designate the communication adapter that the software will utilize to navigate the network, along with adjusting the properties of said adapter. When connecting to MPI/Profibus, utilizing the Auto setting may help detect the network specifications (such as baud rate) before adjusting the interface accordingly.</p>

            <p>I have a question for all the tech enthusiasts out there - I have two cables in need of identification. The first cable is a CableTech Technology B7864490, a 9-pin female to RJ45 cable. Could this cable have been used to connect to Siemens PLCs? The second cable is a 9-pin male to RJ45 cable with no identifiable brand name, approximately 18 inches in length. Additionally, there is a StarTech USB to 9-pin male cable. Could this USB cable have been used to interface with Siemens PLCs? Looking forward to your insight! - James</p>

            <p>James Mcquade is seeking help in identifying two cables he has. The first cable is a CableTech Technology B7864490, a 9-pin female to RJ45 cable. It is commonly used for connecting to serial devices like managed switches via the console port. This cable is not meant for ethernet connection but for serial communication with devices that have an RJ45 socket. The second cable is a 9-pin male to RJ45 cable without any identifiable brand name, approximately 18 inches long. There is also a StarTech USB to 9-pin male cable. It is possible that these cables could have been used to interface with Siemens PLCs. It's important to note that Siemens PLCs typically use a specific protocol like RS485 for MPI/Profibus, which may not be supported by general tools. While these cables may be useful for certain connections, it's essential to check if they specifically support the required protocols for Siemens PLCs.</p>

            <p>James Mcquade confirmed that both Allen Bradley and Omron products are fully supported without any problems. Additionally, he inquired about receiving ladder rungs without descriptions on these devices. This is a common occurrence as symbols are not automatically downloaded to the PLC when the program is uploaded. To retain the symbols, you would need to open the Logix program and upload them manually.</p>

            <p>James Mcquade described a 9-pin male to RJ45 cable that is approximately 18 inches long, without a distinguishable brand name. It is important to exercise caution when using this cable, as it may be a proprietary serial cable. Connecting this cable from the DB9 port on an S7-300 CPU to the LAN port on a laptop could potentially result in damage. It is advisable not to plug either cable #1 or #2 into a standard LAN port. There are MPI-to-Ethernet adapters available in a compact form that can be plugged into the DB9 port, which are easily identifiable by prominent labels. It is unlikely that the cable in question is one of these adapters.</p>

            <p>It is important to be cautious about what you connect to the 9-pin port on the PLC, as it carries 24V on certain pins to power the PC adapter. Connecting incompatible devices can result in damage. Additionally, be mindful of leaving a null modem adapter plugged in, as it can render your costly PC adapter useless.</p>

            <p>mad4x4 explained that after uploading a program, symbols are not automatically downloaded to the PLC. To keep the symbols, one must open the Logix program and upload them into it. This applies to S7-300 PLCs, while 1200 and 1500 (including et200sp CPU in the 1500 class) should have symbols, comments, etc., downloaded. When using TIA Portal, it is essential to match the version being uploaded with the version that was downloaded to the PLC. It is possible to detect the Portal version the PLC is using from within the Portal interface. However, note that the Portal version and the PLC firmware version are not directly related. 

Importantly, handling failsafe PLC uploads may be more complex than standard PLCs due to safety strategies in place at the plant. For instance, 1200F does not support uploading safety code, making it challenging to incorporate the PLC into a new project. On the other hand, 1500F supports uploading safety code starting around version 15, but this feature is typically disabled by default and must be enabled before uploading is possible. 

Additionally, it is recommended to create a binary backup of the PLC for disaster recovery purposes, as Siemens emphasizes the importance of offline projects over emergency uploads. Pay attention to the cables being used, as plugging a serial RJ45 into an Ethernet port could lead to damage, particularly with Profibus/MPI connections. It is best to avoid this to prevent potential hardware issues.</p>

            <p>If you are using older S7-400's with the CP243 Ethernet card, be cautious as this card had DB9 connectors. When I first started a new job, the engineers encountered a problem with the PLC system over the weekend. A reset was performed, potentially deleting the program or causing issues with the PSU. After seeking help from a local systems house, it was discovered that a faulty adapter was the root of the issue, causing 3 days of lost production and a significant cost. Additionally, an outdated program version caused stirrers in the cooling tanks to malfunction until a Dutch engineer provided an updated program. This situation highlights the importance of proper equipment and software compatibility to prevent costly mistakes and production downtime.</p>

            <p>Parky asked whether older Ethernet cards used 9-pin 232 type sockets. It is more likely that they used DB15 connectors instead of DB9. DB15 was the common Ethernet connection type before the introduction of BNC and RJ45 connectors. It is important to note that every DB15 Ethernet connection is typically meant to be connected to BNC or RJ45 using an AUI interface. (source: Wikipedia)</p>

            <p>Jesper, you are correct. I remember now that it has 15 pins and contains active components powered by 24v. The original device was bulky, but we replaced it with a smaller one.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What interface cables should I use to upload programs from Siemens S7-300 and S7-1200 PLCs with 9-pin ports, as well as S7-1200 and Simatic ET 2000SP PLCs with Ethernet connectivity?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - You can use USB, Ethernet, or serial cables based on the port availability on your PC and PLCs. For PLCs with 9-pin ports, a serial cable may be required, while Ethernet cables can be used for PLCs with Ethernet connectivity.</p>
