                    <p>Hey there! I'm curious if anyone has developed an application using System Platform that is object-based. I typically create applications in System Platform using a tag-based approach. This involves creating a galaxy and then designing the application within Intouch Maker in the IDE, incorporating tags and Archestra graphics. However, I have never utilized objects in my deployments - only deploying the ViewEngine and the application itself. If anyone has an object-based galaxy they'd be willing to share, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>Hello joaco1993, for step-by-step instructions on accessing the "SA Water Demo 2014 R2" demo focused on Situational Awareness graphics within a System Platform environment, log in to the Schneider Electric Global Support website and navigate to the Product Hub. Ensure you have Wonderware System Platform 2014 R2 installed to import the demo files into a new project or galaxy. 

The System Platform object design differs from traditional InTouch tag design. It involves designing how the entire application will operate with all its equipment, components, and relationships before creating the HMI graphics. This approach offers more capabilities but requires a different mindset.

If you are in New York, consider attending System Platform classes offered by Wonderware North in the upcoming months. Additionally, access online resources in the Schneider Electric training catalog for further education. If you have a Wonderware Customer FIRST agreement, most online materials are complimentary.

Reach out to Wonderware North for guidance or educational tips tailored to your project or customer needs. This support will help enhance your understanding and utilization of System Platform features effectively.</p>

            <p>Hello joaco1993, 

Unfortunately, the demos for Wonderware System Platform 2014 R2 have been updated to showcase the latest features since its release at the end of 2014. I recommend contacting Wonderware North as their System Consultants may have a demo of the previous version stored or can provide you with a similar demo application. If you send me your contact information via private message, I can assist in connecting you with Wonderware North. 

Since you are located in New York, which is outside my sales team's area, I suggest reaching out to Wonderware North's team for further assistance. I apologize for not being able to offer more help in this matter. 

Best regards,
Jeremy</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. What is the difference between object-based and tag-based approaches in Wonderware System Platform development?
- The tag-based approach involves creating a galaxy and designing the application within Intouch Maker in the IDE, utilizing tags and Archestra graphics. On the other hand, the object-based approach focuses on deploying ViewEngine and utilizing objects in the deployments.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How can I transition from a tag-based approach to an object-based approach in Wonderware System Platform?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Transitioning involves understanding the concept of objects in System Platform and how they can be utilized in application development. You may need to adapt your existing application design to incorporate objects effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. Can you provide an example of an object-based galaxy developed in Wonderware System Platform?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - While the thread mentions a request for sharing an object-based galaxy, it's recommended to explore Wonderware's official resources, community forums, or training materials for practical examples and guidance on developing object-based applications.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. What are the benefits of using an object-based approach in Wonderware System Platform development?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Object-based development in System Platform offers advantages such as reusability, modular design, easier maintenance, and scalability. It allows for a more structured and efficient way of building applications compared to tag-based approaches.</p>
