            <p>Before sending the program to the HMI, did you ensure that the runtime communications link settings were confirmed? It is important to clarify whether the PanelView program is syncing with your PC PLC program or the online PLC. This crucial step should be considered to prevent any potential errors in the system. Is this something you have checked? - James</p>

            <p>dmroeder mentioned that the issue described in KB article BF21432 involves seeing question marks even though communications are functioning properly. The problem is that PVP does not support special characters like accent marks in application names. It is possible that the issue may be related to Windows language settings, especially considering Luis is from Mexico. Luis could try changing the accent marks to numbers instead of text or letters to see if that resolves the problem.</p>

It's interesting that the KB article discusses non-English characters in the MER name. Testing with an accent character in the name to see if it causes any issues.</p>
