            <p>Are you experiencing any issues in the system console logs? Is this problem occurring across all applications or only in the Dryer Main application? Is it happening in all windows within Dryer Main or just a specific one? Uncovering the root cause of these errors can help resolve them effectively.</p>

            <p>Hey Rob, I don't have SMC, but I do have the Operation console. I've included a picture for reference. This issue occurs across all applications and affects all windows in Canva, not just the Dryer main screen. When interacting with objects in Canva, the window maker crashes, and no errors are logged in the console.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When developing a new application, test its stability by adding a window to see if it functions without crashing. If it does crash, consider contacting Aveva for assistance. If the window addition is successful, experiment with exporting and importing the tag database from an existing application into the new one. You can also transfer windows from other applications to enhance the new app's functionality.</p>
