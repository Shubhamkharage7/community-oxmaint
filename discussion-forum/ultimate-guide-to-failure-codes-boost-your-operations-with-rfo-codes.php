            <p>I am interested in finding a comprehensive list of failure codes that could potentially stem from a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) conducted on critical assets. My objective is to revamp our current system of failure and cause code development for our equipment. One of the key goals is to align fault codes with the alarms operators use to report maintenance issues, creating a common plant vocabulary. When an operator reports a fault or alarm triggered by the control system, we aim to respond promptly, troubleshoot, and repair the issue. The Maintenance technician will then document the alarm, cause code, action code, and corrective actions taken to resolve the problem, providing valuable historical data for reliability analysis and reference. This historical record not only assists current technicians in troubleshooting but also serves as a valuable resource for future team members. A comprehensive list of fault codes for both alarmed and non-alarmed failures would be beneficial for our analysis and reference purposes.</p>

            <p>Attached is an article I penned on the topic of Failure Codes, which could provide some insightful reflections for you. This piece delves into the importance of understanding and learning from failure, offering valuable insights and perspectives on the subject. Give it a read and see how it can benefit your perspective on dealing with setbacks and challenges.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>At present, we rely on RFO codes, but we believe it's time to broaden our horizons. I recommend convening a collaborative brainstorming session with key stakeholders such as maintenance supervisors, maintenance technicians, and planners to enhance our list of codes. Take ownership of the list by not only including failure codes but also corrective action codes. In a consulting capacity for a leading pharmaceutical company, I witnessed the extensive use of failure codes in the Maximo CMMS system. This comprehensive list fosters in-depth analysis, contributing to the effectiveness of Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action Systems (FRACAS). Best regards, Lyndiana</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To ensure the list is comprehensive but not overly repetitive, take care when expanding it so that various users do not use different codes to describe the same failure. Encourage brainstorming sessions with planners, supervisors, and seasoned technicians from each crew or trade. After, double-check to eliminate any duplicate codes. This approach helps avoid confusion and optimizes the list's usability for troubleshooting and maintenance tasks.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When brainstorming, be sure to involve operating supervisors as well. Having a system that allows anyone, not just maintenance experts, to submit requests can lead to the misuse of the "other" code. Remember to consider the input of all stakeholders to avoid potential issues.</p>

            <p>When entering data, it's important to apply the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle by considering the perspective of the person inputting the information. Put yourself in their shoes and imagine being the most lazy, mean, and unintelligent person on the planet having a bad day. How would they react if the code they needed to type was conveniently listed in a dropdown menu with 120 options? In this scenario, it would be best to categorize only the top 10 most common choices, with the option to select "other" for any additional causes, failures, or problems. This streamlined approach can greatly simplify the data entry process.</p>

            <p>It is important to provide a specific description in the comments section when selecting "Other" as the option. If a particular issue recurs frequently, it should be added to the dropdown menu for easier tracking. Addressing issues such as attitude problems and lack of understanding in failure analysis is crucial for the overall improvement of operations. Avoid vague references and instead, create a comprehensive list tailored to your facility's needs. Remember, the key is to Keep It Simple (KISS) and take charge of managing your business effectively to avoid being controlled by it. This is essential for success.</p>

            <p>To enhance user experience, consider organizing the drop-down list in a hierarchical system resembling a computer file structure. This can group failures by categories such as mechanical and electrical failures, making it easier for users to navigate and find specific items quickly. By clicking on a category, users can access a condensed list of relevant failures instead of scrolling through a long, alphabetically organized list of 120 items. This user-friendly feature can streamline the search process and improve overall efficiency.</p>

            <p>quote: It's time for an attitude adjustment for the employee who is considered the meanest, laziest, and dumbest in the plant. Instead of resorting to disciplinary action, let me explain why a different approach may be more effective. Testing functionality doesn't always require a highly-educated individual; often, a willing participant can suffice. In the past, when testing new software, we enlisted the help of Shirley, an administrative employee who lacked technical skills but had the right attitude. This is not a criticism based on gender. If the software passed Shirley's test, we could confidently label it as "Approved and Tested under Extreme Conditions." While others may have given up and tossed the computer out the window, Shirley would persist and uncover even more flaws. There have been whispers about her having mysterious abilities, such as allegedly causing a computer's hard drive to crash just by staring at it.</p>

            <p>When considering who is submitting a request, it's important to keep in mind that operators, rather than tradespeople, will likely be the primary requesters. The list they choose from should be similar to the one provided by Bryan Weir, tailored to our industry. This list, known as "Problem Codes," helps identify the issues encountered. Once the work order is completed, there is a section for a "Failure Code" to specify the exact cause of the failure. This is where tradespeople can provide detailed input based on the specific equipment they worked on. Do you agree with this approach, or do you have a different perspective?

            <p>It is important that the failure code is specific to the equipment class. Consider involving a specialized equipment expert to help create a comprehensive list of codes. This will ensure accurate identification of issues and efficient troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with you, Fergy. As stated in my report, the effectiveness of system codes depends heavily on the expertise of the users. For instance, if inexperienced operators are using the codes to log equipment issues, they should be kept simple and general. On the other hand, more complex and specific failure codes can be tailored for skilled maintenance personnel working on particular plants, if necessary. This approach ensures that the codes are targeted appropriately based on the user's level of expertise.</p>

            <p>It is essential for codes to accurately represent failures, issues, and resolutions in order to ensure meaningful analysis of data. It is advisable for the codes to be carefully crafted by experts in equipment reliability to achieve this. Proper training for users on code interpretation is crucial for effective utilization of this data.</p>

            <p>Numerous MP2 users take advantage of the Safety Notes field by inputting their Reasons for Outage (RFOs) and Solutions. This information is then directly printed on the Work Order, allowing maintenance personnel to easily identify and input the corresponding RFO and Solution pair without any confusion. I have created a specialized Crystal Report that generates an Excel file containing RFO and Solution sets for every equipment unit. This file can be seamlessly integrated into your equipment module. For a sample, please feel free to contact me at df@flemingtechnical.com. Thank you, Donal. Explore more at www.flemingtechnical.com.</p>

            <p>Creating outage reason codes, also known as RFO codes, can greatly assist in quickly pinpointing the root cause of equipment issues, saving you time from sifting through a plethora of comments on resolved work orders. To develop these codes effectively, start by generating a work order history report sorted by equipment type. Analyze the data from past work orders along with your expertise to compile a list of potential failure reasons, then assign corresponding codes. Due to the 8-character limit, it's advisable to use abbreviations and keep the codes as straightforward as possible. Educate your maintenance team on the codes and display them in areas where work orders are logged. While it may take some time for the codes to become ingrained in the workflow, remain patient as the benefits will eventually materialize.</p>
