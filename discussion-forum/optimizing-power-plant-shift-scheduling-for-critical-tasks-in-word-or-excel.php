                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As a non-programmer Operator in a power plant, I am responsible for reviewing and organizing the weekly schedule generated by our planners. The current numeric sorting of orders makes it challenging to prioritize tasks that have significant operational impacts. I manually sort through the list to identify jobs that require equipment lockout or operational reconfigurations. Once I compile a sub-list of critical tasks, I input them into a WORD document for the operational shifts to ensure timely shutdowns and equipment lockouts.

For example, I exclude routine lubrication route jobs that do not affect operations but prioritize tasks like the annual maintenance of Feedwater Pumps that necessitate equipment lockouts and operational adjustments. However, the numeric series sorting may not reflect the actual priority of tasks, leading to potential oversights.

I am open to exploring alternative methods for generating SAP reports or transferring data to WORD or Excel to streamline this process. While time is not a constraint, budget constraints limit our ability to invest in software solutions. My programming skills are basic, but I can provide examples of the current SAP schedule and my manual WORD document to illustrate our current workflow. Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Wayne.</p>

            <p>Wayne, when generating reports from SAP, consider including the start dates in an additional column sorted in ascending order for easier data manipulation. Alternatively, opt to have the report sent in Excel format for increased convenience. - Greg</p>

            <p>Wayne, a helpful feature in SAP for identifying orders and operations requiring special preparation is the System Condition field. This field can be set on the order header or on each operation, offering options like Full operation, Isolated, Limited operation, and Shutdown. Customizing the display layout is also possible, allowing you to show preferred fields and sort them as desired. Multiple layouts can be defined and switched between effortlessly. To export data to Excel, simply locate the download icon on the list. In the Order or Operation List Display, there is an icon resembling a calculator that enables downloading the list to Excel.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Wayne, I agree with David's suggestion regarding how planners currently identify the need for production support or setup on work orders. Are there standard parameters on work orders indicating when a job requires a process or subsystem to be offline? If so, and if you have access to display functions in SAP, you should be able to query, filter, and export necessary lists to Excel. For example, we use the system condition field with options for Running (work can be done anytime), Down (work only during scheduled maintenance), and Outage (work during extended process downtime). This field can be used to group work items and further segregate using parameters such as planning group, plant section, and work center. We have also used the revision functionality to organize work scheduled during maintenance (Down), work that can be done anytime (Running), and next major outage/shutdown. As David mentioned, look for an icon for exporting or try the key combination (Shift + F4). - Steven</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is evident that there is a significant improvement needed in our current planning process. Our planners are currently utilizing a report titled "ZNE1146_PRINTWEEK", which they manually mark with a highlighter to indicate jobs that may require shutdown and lockout procedures. Upon reviewing SAP, I see the "System Condition" field you mentioned, with the options "In Operation" and "Not In Operation". To enhance efficiency, it seems beneficial to potentially expand these options to include "Isolated, Limited Operation" and "Shutdown".

The report is currently inundated with unnecessary PMs and standing orders, causing clutter. By filtering the list based on the mentioned codes and sorting by day of the week, a more streamlined list can be generated. Is there a resource, guide, or tutorial available that can provide a step-by-step walkthrough of this process? While I grasp the concept, a detailed guide would be immensely helpful.

Although I can view the system condition field on individual orders, it disappears when exporting to Excel, hindering my ability to sort effectively. It is clear that I am navigating this process alone, as evident from my reliance on a magic marker for highlights. Thank you, Wayne.</p>

            <p>Hello Wayne, if you're looking for tutorials or manuals to guide you through this process, there are plenty of books available on the market. However, I can offer you a quick guide that may be of help. After selecting the correct Plant, Main Work Center, Dates, and executing the search (via IW38 or 39), you should see the "Current" icon with 3 little boxes stepped down over another square (likely next to the âˆ‘ icon) or use the shortcut Ctrl + F8. This will bring up the Change Layout box. A helpful tip is to click on the Column Name box under Column Set to put all items in alphabetical order below. Locate "System Condition" or any other desired fields, drag them to the left column, and position them as needed. Save this new layout as your Default Setting by clicking on the Save tab, giving it a name, and clicking on the Green Tick. You can further arrange the data columns by highlighting and dragging them right or left. Sort the data in ascending or descending order by highlighting the column and clicking on the respective icons (located just to the left of the calculator icon). Once the data is arranged to your liking, follow David's instructions to export and save the file. In future searches, remember to select your desired "Layout" at the bottom of the List Edit page. You can even save this as a variant by clicking the Save button and giving it a name. I hope this explanation helps. Greg</p>

            <p>Relax! We don't need to print anything as we are embracing a paperless concept. Our planning process involves creating job steps (referred to as Operations in SAP) with specific start and end dates for each step, known as schedule dates. The first step in the process may involve isolating the system, a task typically undertaken by the operations team. The next step involves repairing or restoring equipment to functionality, a task completed by the maintenance team. Both teams work together in our work center. Once the teams have committed to the job, they work towards accomplishing it. They use IW37 to monitor tasks and steps that need to be completed. We hope that our approach can be of assistance.</p>

            <p>Hello wsquared, there are various methods to prioritize tasks based on your Maintenance and Integrity philosophy. David has proposed configuring SAP to focus on essentials, or you could utilize Compliance categories for PM activities. GIW has also provided insights on optimizing user experience. These approaches align with the assumption that Technical authorities within your organization agree on the necessary settings. Panuphan's suggestion pertains to scheduling planned jobs efficiently. Consider using tools like the planning board to sequence job execution. Prioritization occurs at the operations level, while job sequencing happens at the work order level. Ensure to align your settings with David and GIW's recommendations for optimal results.</p>

            <p>The blog post provides a variety of helpful suggestions, some more complex than others. It is crucial to ensure that your Preventative Maintenance program is built on a strong foundation. This includes clearly defining all tasks, from the maintenance planner/scheduler to the preventative maintenance program administrator (two distinct roles). Additionally, it is essential to properly configure Tasks and Maintenance Plans in SAP, ensuring all necessary indicators are in place (such as work centers, call horizons, and maintenance activity types). Make the most of task lists and operations by utilizing them to their full potential. When preparing for PM tasks, like an annual maintenance event, create additional task lists in advance to streamline the process. Some task lists may serve as simple reminders to order parts and schedule contractors. When it comes to scheduling, it is a separate but equally important aspect to consider. Have you assessed your work center capacities?</p>

            <p>jafnarf is right on target with this approach. By organizing your task lists, maintenance plans, and permits, you are well on your way to achieving a high-quality weekly schedule. After creating these work orders, there is no need to print or export them, as the employees responsible for the work can easily access them through IW37 and take necessary actions. The planner should utilize CM25 to schedule based on the capacities of the available work centers.</p>
