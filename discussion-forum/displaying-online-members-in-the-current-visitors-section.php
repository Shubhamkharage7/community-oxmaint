                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>The new forum format now includes a "Current Visitors" section that displays the total number of connected members and visitors. However, identifying online members is now done by hovering over their avatars, which can be time-consuming with a large number of users online. The previous forum format listed member usernames instead, allowing for a quicker assessment of who was online. Would it be possible to revert back to displaying usernames instead of avatars? I personally found this feature useful, especially when waiting for a specific member to respond to my feedback or question.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, we do not have complete control over our domain as the platform is structured in a specific way. However, I have been familiarizing myself with the member icons and I urge everyone to select distinctive icons. The visual we choose will serve as our "brand" and help others identify our online presence. I will pass along this recommendation to the design team. Thank you, Terry O.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, we don't have control over our domain as this is how the platform operates. However, it's important to choose unique icons to represent ourselves online. Our selected graphics will serve as our "brand" and make it easier for others to recognize us. I will share this suggestion with the design team. Thank you, Terry O, for passing it along. I hope the team will consider exploring different options. This situation reminds me of a similar issue with a software package at my workplace. The software engineer struggled to understand user issues with a particular page until he saw it on a laptop screen, which highlighted the importance of considering different screen sizes during development.</p>
