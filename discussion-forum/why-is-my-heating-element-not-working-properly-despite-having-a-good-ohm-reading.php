            <p>Have you checked the resistance value of the old heater "upstream," meaning through the heating element and its wiring? It's possible that a loose connection in the circuit was corrected when the heater was replaced. Make sure to verify these components to ensure proper functionality.</p>

            <p>When diagnosing an electric water heater issue, it's essential to check the resistance value both at the old heater and throughout the wiring leading to it. A loose connection in the circuit could have been the root cause of the problem, which may have been resolved by simply replacing the heater. In my case, after confirming the presence of 480V at the element, I proceeded to measure the ohms at the element terminals. Surprisingly, the old element may still be in good working condition.</p>

            <p>One possible issue may arise when power is first applied to the element, causing it to go open circuit. This could be due to a faulty connection within the element or a malfunctioning element that temporarily opens up when cold. I recall experiencing a similar situation with a bulb that flickered for a moment after being replaced. When I tested the bulb with a meter, it initially seemed fine, but then displayed an open circuit. However, after a brief period, it measured correctly again.</p>

            <p>Parky suggested that the issue may be due to the element going open circuit once power is applied, possibly caused by a bad connection or a faulty element that only opens up when cold or powerless. This phenomenon is similar to a bulb Parky once encountered, which appeared fine when tested with a meter but failed once reinstalled. Similarly, Parky recalled a fuse that tested good outside the circuit but opened up when voltage was applied, dubbing it a "Half Blown Fuse." This peculiar behavior was so surprising that Parky kept it as a conversation piece on their desk.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your valuable contributions. In hindsight, I realize I should have included the picture sooner. This component originates from a vintage Sterlco water heater. I highly doubt the issue stems from a loose wire connection at the terminals, considering the use of ring connectors for the connection. Even if the nuts were to come loose, the continuity should still be intact. The water heater unit is not exposed to any significant vibrations or external factors.

My current suspicion is that the element may be failing once power is applied and it begins to heat up. I am interested in testing this theory safely. Is it advisable to conduct a bench test with 480V in an open-air setting for this purpose?</p>

            <p>When dealing with a 3 phase 480V system, it is common to see three sets of two elements wired in series. The connection and labeling might not be clear, giving it a strange appearance, possibly indicating intentional underuse. The recommended approach would be to avoid testing and simply replace the components if needed, as they are relatively inexpensive. However, if you are curious, you can individually test the elements with 120V to ensure they function properly. Caution should be taken to avoid overheating the elements by running them for extended periods in free air. The suitability for full load testing will depend on the specific setup in place.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to 5618, a typical setup for 480V 3-phase would involve three pairs of elements connected in series. Upon closer inspection, the wiring seems unusual and may not be operating at full capacity intentionally. Instead of testing the setup, it may be safer to discard it as replacements are affordable. However, if curiosity strikes, testing the elements individually with 120V to ensure they heat up could be an option. It is important to avoid running the elements for too long in free air to prevent damage. The feasibility of full load testing would depend on the specific setup in question. Indeed, there are 6 coils in total.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the necessity of removing heat from heating elements to prevent burning, danw discovered a surprising setup at a silicone extrusion shop. Following the extruder, there was a brief high-heat chamber leading to a 30-foot curing oven tunnel. The high-heat chamber utilized 240V rod heating elements exposed in the open air, heating the chamber to temperatures exceeding 550°F. Despite the elements glowing red hot and continuing to emit heat after shutdown, the shop had never needed to replace them. Conversely, heating elements in the tunnel oven required occasional replacement.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Impressive! Utilizing two independent sets wired in a wye configuration is a clever idea that hadn't crossed my mind initially. Instead, I had envisioned an assembly that could be configured for either 240V or 480V delta. As long as the assembly utilizes 277V rated elements, like the ones you're using, you're in good shape. However, I have come across enough mistakes to realize that a misconfigured assembly with 240V elements, similar to my initial assumption, could potentially be installed mistakenly, leading to a reduced lifespan.

Have you noticed a slower heat-up time compared to before? It is possible that one of the three elements in the group has failed, causing a reduction in heat output. The remaining two elements will then have a lower voltage supply, resulting in even less heat being produced. If one of the remaining two elements fails, there will be no heat generated at all. Look for less scale on the visible element, as it may indicate that this particular element failed first.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>While I used to believe that heater elements should always be submerged in water, my perspective changed when I visited a silicone extrusion facility. Upon observing the setup, I noticed a brief hi-heat chamber with 240V rod heating elements heating the chamber to 550°F. Surprisingly, the rods glowed red hot and retained heat even after the power was turned off. The employees mentioned they had never replaced a heating element in the hi-heat chamber but had replaced elements in the curing oven tunnel. This experience made me realize that heater elements can be designed to function effectively in free air, like the extruder heaters in this particular operation. It's interesting to note how different applications call for distinct designs in heater elements.</p>
