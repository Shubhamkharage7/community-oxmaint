                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>A while back, I received training from WonderWare on setting up the Historian software. However, I have retained very little of that knowledge, and have not successfully completed a setup on my own. Despite no errors in the configurator and all indicators showing green, I encountered issues when trying to view trends and import tags in IDAS. I have experienced timeouts, cursor loading hang-ups, and difficulty in launching the viewer. I have tried troubleshooting with Google to no avail. Any guidance on resolving these issues would be greatly appreciated.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After reinstalling Patch 04, the Historian is up and running. I have a couple more queries regarding its functionality. Firstly, when I restart the viewer in a standalone installation using Modbus, the existing alarms are timestamped with the viewer start time. Is there a way to link the alarm page to an SQL database for accurate timestamps? Secondly, is it necessary for the Viewer to be active for the Historian to record data? This seems illogical, but I am noticing gaps in the logs already. Thank you.</p>

            <p>In InTouch 2014 standalone, WindowViewer must be active on the alarm logging PC/server in order to record alarms to the SQL database. This is because alarms are created individually for each client.</p>
