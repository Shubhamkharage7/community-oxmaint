                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently using a Automaton Direct EA7-T6CL+13812B141 HMI with C-more programming V 2.78. I have attempted to connect using various cables such as a USB cable and an Ethernet crossover cable, but I am unable to successfully read from the panel. Despite being able to access features like "Make New Project" and "Read From Disk", the option to read from the panel under the file menu is not functioning as intended. The manual provides instructions on three different connection methods: using an Ethernet cable with a switch or hub, a crossover cable directly to the panel, or a USB connection to the designated port on the panel. I have tested all methods except for the switch method and will try that next. Additionally, I have discovered the panel's IP address and successfully changed it to match my home network's IP (192.168.1.XXX), allowing me to access the panel through my web browser. However, I am still encountering difficulties in locating the panel within C-more. Any suggestions on why this issue persists would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>

            <p>What is your current C-More software version? The latest version compatible with EA7 panels is 2.78, while newer versions are designed for the EA9 series exclusively. The great advantage is that you can run multiple versions simultaneously on your system.</p>

            <p>Apologies for resurrecting this old thread, but I encountered a similar issue where using the demo version of C-More 2.78 was the root cause. My solution involved reinstalling C-More and inputting my license number, which enabled the "Read from Panel" function, allowing me to successfully upload the project.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why am I unable to successfully read from the Automation Direct EA7 HMI panel using various connection cables?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: If you are facing issues with reading from the panel using USB or Ethernet cables, it could be due to a connection problem or settings misconfiguration. Ensure that the cables are properly connected and try different connection methods as suggested in the manual.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I troubleshoot the problem of not being able to locate the Automation Direct EA7 HMI panel within C-more despite changing the IP address?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: If you have changed the panel's IP address to match your home network but still cannot locate it within C-more, try checking the network settings on both the panel and your computer to ensure they are on the same network. Additionally, verify that the panel's IP address is correctly set up in the C-more software.</p>
