                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am encountering an issue with my Cognex In-Sight jobs not saving due to a network error. I suspect this issue is linked to the connection with a 1783-NATR and a missing custom rule. Despite searching for the custom rule without success, I have tried utilizing custom rules from the In-Sight Explorer Help pages that outline the camera's ports. Additionally, I attempted using ports known to work with a Dataman scanner over NATR, but none of these solutions have resolved the problem. The error occurs when attempting to save a job while connecting to the In-Sight Sensors and selecting the specific sensor in question.

Has anyone successfully saved a job through a NATR device? I have been able to save job files on a camera directly connected to the network or by physically connecting to the camera subnet. This led me to believe that the issue may be related to the custom rules of the NATR. Any experiences or insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I encountered a similar problem while using the In-Sight Vision Suite for my D902 series cameras. Despite my efforts to create enough rules, I found that there was a limit of 5 rules that could be created, which was not sufficient for optimal functionality. Resorting to WireShark, I identified the necessary ports for different functions, such as TCP 443 for HTTPS, TCP 8084 for Web HMI HTTP, UDP 1069 for In-Sight Discovery, TCP 50000 for the data channel, and TCP/UDP 123 for NTP. While this allowed me to connect online and view programs, I encountered difficulties with editing and saving programs. These tasks resulted in issues with the cameras, including increased processing times, network errors, and malfunctioning web HMI until the cameras were power-cycled. This experience was based on using In-Sight Vision Suite, which was a relatively new software at the time. For potentially better results, consider utilizing In-Sight Explorer. If you discover a solution to this problem, please share it for the benefit of others.</p>

            <p>MikeyN shared a similar issue encountered while using In-Sight Vision Suite with D902 series cameras. Despite limitations in creating rules, a solution was found by identifying specific ports through WireShark analysis. The necessary ports identified were: TCP 443 for HTTPS, TCP 8084 for Web HMI HTTP, UDP 1069 for In-Sight Discovery, TCP 50000 for Data Channel, and TCP/UDP 123 for NTP. This configuration enabled online access but editing and saving programs caused camera malfunctions. Consider exploring In-Sight Explorer for potential improvements. For further assistance, reaching out to Rockwell or Cognex may provide additional solutions. Stay tuned for updates on this issue.</p>
