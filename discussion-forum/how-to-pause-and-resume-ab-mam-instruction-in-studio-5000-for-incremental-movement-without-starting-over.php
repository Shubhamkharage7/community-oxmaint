                    <p>Hello everyone, I am a novice looking for guidance. I am trying to halt and resume an incremental MAM instruction in Studio 5000, but with a specific condition - I only want it to continue from where it left off, not start the entire movement again. I attempted using a MAS to pause the instruction, but upon resuming the MAM, it covers the entire distance instead of just the remaining portion. Any advice on how to achieve this would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Understanding the concept of incremental movement is crucial. When you trigger an Incremental Motion Actuator Module (MAM), the servo will move a specific distance from its current position. It seems like you might be looking for an absolute MAM instead. With an incremental MAM, each movement instance is independent - once stopped, it is essentially reset. To continue moving further, you would need to adjust the incremental distance. If it were an absolute distance, you could pause and resume the movement to reach the exact position.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>That's right - it's not possible to pause an incremental movement. To achieve this, you can monitor the position as you make the initial move, and then adjust the second incremental move accordingly. Alternatively, you can opt to execute two MAM Absolute moves targeting the same position. This way, you can ensure a seamless operation without interruptions.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I was considering using an incremental move type Motion Axis Module (MAM) because I want to avoid reaching an absolute position, as the end position varies with each cycle. My goal is to move a specific distance from the current position. However, I also need to have the ability to pause the move with a Stop Push Button (PB) and then resume from where it left off, covering the remaining distance. One possibility I considered is using a Motion Axis Jog (MAJ) and continuously monitoring the actual position to calculate the distance needed to jog after a stop. However, this approach seems cumbersome and may not be the most optimal solution. Alternatively, I thought about resetting the axis position to zero after each cycle and using absolute positioning. I am unsure if this is a viable option though.</p>

            <p>Robertmee pointed out that you cannot pause an incremental move. To achieve this, monitor the position during the initial move and subtract it from the second incremental move. Alternatively, you can utilize two MAM Absolute moves with the same target. Thank you for the assistance! I will attempt to implement two incremental moves as per your suggestion.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When starting a new incremental move, it is crucial to determine the axis's current absolute position. By adding your desired movement increment to this position, you can set the target for the absolute move. Knowing the initial absolute position is key for a successful and accurate incremental movement.</p>

            <p>In the initial stages of the incremental movement, do you have information on the actual absolute position of the axis? If so, you can simply add the movement increment to the current position to set the target for the absolute move. This process is straightforward for linear axes that move in a straight line. However, for rotary axes that loop back to zero as they move, the calculations and instructions are more complex. For instance, if a rotary axis reaches 350 degrees and you need to move it by 20 degrees with a rollover set at 360 degrees, you would have to make an absolute move to 10 degrees and ensure that the movement is only in the forward direction.</p>

            <p>In my experience, most of the motion control systems I've encountered have involved linear motion, utilizing either a linear motor or a gear/ball screw setup. There was one instance where I dealt with a rotary position that cycled with each rotation, although I didn't personally configure it. This serves as a valuable reminder to consider different types of motion control systems in various applications.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In my search for a motion control solution, I initially considered opting for an incremental Move-Along-Motion (MAM) system instead of an absolute one. This decision stemmed from the fact that the end position would vary with each cycle, and I simply needed to travel a specific distance from the current position. However, after exploring various suggestions, including the idea of calculating the traveled distance, I realized that it is possible to achieve the desired outcome even with an absolute position system. By assigning the end position as a reference and updating it before each cycle, flexibility can be maintained while still ensuring accurate positioning. This approach has proven effective in scenarios where a fixed number of positions are cycled through or when dealing with numerous calculated pick-and-place positions.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  How can I pause and resume an incremental MAM instruction in Studio 5000 without restarting the entire movement?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> To achieve this, you can use a combination of instructions like MAS to pause the movement and then resume it from where it left off. Ensure that the logic is designed to track the position and resume accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Why does resuming the MAM instruction cover the entire distance instead of just the remaining portion?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> This issue occurs because the logic might not be correctly handling the current position and restarting the movement from the beginning. Make sure that the program is designed to resume the MAM instruction from the last known position.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Can you provide guidance on implementing a pause and resume functionality for an incremental MAM instruction in Studio 5000?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> One approach is to use a conditional logic that tracks the position of the movement before pausing (using MAS) and then resumes the MAM instruction from that position when the condition for resuming is met. Review your program logic to ensure it aligns with this approach.</p>
