                    <p>Are you curious about how to gauge World Class Performance in maintenance? Achieving a rate of over 80% is key, but what steps should you take to reach this level? Start by outlining your goals, pinpointing the processes, establishing control mechanisms, aligning your actions, crafting procedures, providing training to your employees, and conducting audits for quality control. The question remains: how do you quantify this performance?</p>

            <p>When evaluating maintenance effectiveness, it's crucial to focus on the outcomes of world-class maintenance practices rather than just the process itself. One key metric that can help measure both production and maintenance performance is Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Mike believes OEE is a valuable tool for assessing operational efficiency.</p>

            <p>In order to achieve world-class status in maintenance management, I highly recommend following the guidelines outlined by maintenance expert Terry Wireman in his acclaimed book "Benchmarking Best Practices in Maintenance Management." The key to joining the prestigious "World Class Club" lies in excelling in all 16 topics covered in Wireman's questionnaire, including organization, inventory control, operational involvement, and document management. By evaluating your performance in these crucial areas, you can pinpoint areas for improvement and elevate your business to elite status. This comprehensive approach serves as a valuable starting point for businesses looking to enhance their operations and compete on a global scale.</p>

            <p>Solomon Associates Inc., a renowned global benchmarking firm specializing in the Oil Refining Sector, uses the title of "Pacesetter" to describe top-performing companies. To earn this title, a company must excel in multiple key areas such as energy efficiency, safety, maintenance costs, manpower numbers, and plant availability for a minimum of four years across two benchmarking surveys. This not only requires excellence in various metrics but also consistency in performance. Being a pacesetter is about sustained excellence, not just temporary success.</p>

            <p>In my training material titled "World Class Maintenance Management Strategies - The 12 Disciplines," I explore what sets top industries apart in terms of their maintenance practices. World Class Maintenance Management can be defined as the expert management of maintenance resources by leading global industries. However, the question remains: are we truly managing maintenance, or is the pressure of maintenance managing us? To effectively manage maintenance, it is essential to focus on 12 key disciplines categorized into three levels: Level 1 - The Basics, Level 2 - Intermediate Discipline, and Level 3 - Specialized or Advanced Disciplines. These disciplines cover areas such as equipment condition, autonomous maintenance, training, and preventive maintenance. For a detailed overview and objectives of this course, please visit the following link: http://www.rsareliability.com/WCM%20Preview.ppt. Thank you for your interest. Warm Regards, Miguel.</p>
