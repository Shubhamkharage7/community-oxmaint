                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, we are currently dealing with frequent failures of the bolts connecting the cylinder to the distance piece and the distance piece to the intermediate casing of the crankshaft on our Single Stage Double acting Reciprocating Compressor. These bolt failures are a result of fatigue, with the bolts shearing off while the nuts remain intact. I am seeking advice on two potential solutions: 

1. Upgrading to larger bolts - is this a viable solution to address the issue, and what modifications would be necessary for this change?
2. Using two nuts for tightening instead of one - would this be an effective approach to resolving the problem? 

I would appreciate any guidance on these proposals to improve the performance and reliability of our compressor.</p>

            <p>Failures like these are quite common in industrial settings. They are often caused by fatigue failure due to inadequate fastener tightening. This issue typically arises when fasteners are torqued without proper preload control. Even if a calibrated wrench is used to apply the specified torque, it does not guarantee that the fastener is tightened correctly. Torque simply measures the resistance felt when turning a nut or bolt head, and factors like dirt, damaged threads, and lubrication type can affect the accuracy of torque as an indication of preload.

To ensure proper fastener tightness, measuring the stretch of the fastener to achieve the correct elongation is recommended. This can be easily done with specialized ultrasonic equipment. Alternatively, hydraulic nuts can be used to eliminate torsional errors by generating a direct axial load, where hydraulic pressure is directly related to the retained load. While dial indicators can also be utilized, their accuracy may not be ideal.

By implementing these solutions, such as measuring fastener stretch and using hydraulic nuts, the risk of fastener failures can be minimized. Wishing you success in overcoming this challenge!</p>

            <p>What grade of high tensile strength bolt are you utilizing? Is it 8.8 or higher? Are you considering using double locknuts on the bolt for added security? However, this may not offer any advantages if the bolt itself is failing. Have you ensured that you are using the specific type of bolt recommended by the compressor manufacturer for optimal performance? It's important to avoid overtightening the bolt, as this could lead to yielding and potential breakage caused by thermal expansion of the compressor.</p>

            <p>The Tensile Strength grade of the bolt is 8.8, sourced directly from the Compressor manufacturer. My proposal involves adding a nut on each end of the stud to allow for tightening at both ends. It is important not to over-tighten the bolts to the point of yielding, but rather follow the torque specifications provided by the compressor manufacturer. I trust this addresses your concerns and am eager to receive your valuable feedback.</p>

            <p>Make sure to check for any signs of liquid entering the cylinder, as compressing liquids can put additional strain on the cylinder fastener bolts. An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) utilizes studs that are pre-stressed to 40,000 psi to handle this pressure.</p>

            <p>Jatan, I struggle to see the benefits of using the 2 nut solution. Have you considered opting for a stud with higher tensile strength? Is it consistently the same stud that breaks? If the OEM is providing you with replacements for the weak stud, there may be more to the story. Have you sought the OEM's perspective on this issue?</p>

            <p>The majority of the time, bolts tend to break from the stud end while the nut remains in place. We are currently in the process of informing the OEM about this issue within the next 2-3 days. Additionally, we plan to conduct tests on the bolt's tensile strength and chemical composition in order to determine its properties. Do you have any other suggestions for addressing this issue?</p>

            <p>Jatan, make sure to inspect the failed bolts for any stress risers, such as sharp diameter changes. Also, compare their dimensions to the OEM's bolt drawing to spot any manufacturing flaws. I've encountered multiple instances of fatigue failure in fin fan shafts caused by manufacturing defects like stress raisers in the shafts supplied by the OEM. It's crucial to conduct a failure analysis of the fractured surface to confirm the fatigue failure and determine the root cause. Examining the fractured surface can provide valuable insights into the failure. Regards, Mohammad.</p>
