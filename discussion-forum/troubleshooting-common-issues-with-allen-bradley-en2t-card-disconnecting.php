                    <p>Greetings! Are you familiar with any common problems that can result in the EN2T card (running firmware 10.001) losing communication? Symptoms include the webpage displaying but RSLinx unable to browse, HMI disconnecting from the PLC, and no ping responses. A power cycle temporarily resolves the issue, but it tends to recur. I have a new card on the way and intend to use Wireshark for analysis. Have you encountered this issue before â€“ perhaps a faulty card? This issue has occurred at two different sites.</p>

            <p>What firmware version is currently installed on your ControlLogix processor? We recently encountered a similar issue with version 36 when using v12 EN2T cards, specifically on the controller's ethernet port. Reverting back to firmware version 33 resolved the issue for us. While we have other systems that did not experience the same problem, simply replacing the controller did not solve it. It appears that there may be a compatibility issue with the v12/v36 firmware combination. Rockwell Automation is investigating the issue. This may be relevant to your situation, as we faced the same problem on the controller's ethernet port.</p>

            <p>tlf30 inquired about the firmware version of the ControlLogix processor. They experienced a similar issue with version 36 and version 12 EN2T cards, specifically with the controller's ethernet port. Reverting back to version 33 resolved the issue. Despite having two identical systems without the problem, even replacing the controller did not solve it. The v12/v36 firmware combination seemed to be the root cause. Rockwell Automation is investigating. This issue may be relevant to what you are encountering, as it was the same problem but with the controller's ethernet port.

            <p>Recently, there was a recurring problem with EN2T and L83ES, running on versions 11 and 34. The web analytics indicated a high number of auto negotiate errors. Both the Cisco switch and EN2T were set to auto negotiate. Changing the settings to 100MB for each seemed to fix the issues. There have been no further complaints in the past few weeks. The symptoms were consistent - the module appeared to be working fine, but pinging was unsuccessful and Ignition IO would lose communication. A simple reboot of the module solved the issue.</p>

            <p>Robertmee recently dealt with a similar issue involving EN2T and L83ES modules running on Version 11 and 34, respectively. Web statistics indicated a high number of auto negotiate errors. Both the Cisco switch and EN2T were initially set to auto negotiate, but after switching to 100MB full duplex settings, the issues seemed to clear up. In the following weeks, there were no further complaints regarding connectivity issues. Despite the module showing good status, there were issues with pinging and communication with Ignition IO. A simple reboot of the module would usually fix the problem. If the problem persists after adjusting both the EN2T and switchport settings to 100 MBps full duplex, further troubleshooting may be necessary.</p>
