            <p>Running Studio5000 from an external drive poses no issues, but it is essential to keep the drive connected at all times during computer startup. Failure to do so may result in system crashes or persistent pop-ups due to background programs like FactoryTalk, RSLinx service, and Codemeter launching with Windows. Upon checking Task Manager, I discovered multiple instances of FactoryTalk, Codemeter, Rockwell, and RSLinx components running on my PC.</p>

            <p>When running Studio5000 from an external drive, it is important to ensure that the drive is always connected during computer boot-up. If the drive is not connected, it may result in crashes or persistent pop-ups due to various background programs that start with Windows such as FactoryTalk, RSLinx service, and Codemeter. Checking TaskManager reveals multiple components running, including 8 FactoryTalk components, 3 Codemeter components, 19 Rockwell components, and 2 RSLinx components on the PC. It is crucial to keep these factors in mind to avoid any potential issues.</p>

            <p>I strongly recommend utilizing virtual machines for optimal organization and efficiency. I manage over a dozen VMs running various Rockwell and FTSE versions, ranging from XP to Windows 10. By keeping my laptop OS clean, I am able to easily run these VMs from external drives such as USBs. While my primary VMs are stored on my laptop's SSD, I also have around 10 more on an internal spinner drive and additional ones on an external drive for convenience. This setup allows for seamless access and storage of multiple virtual machines.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. What could be causing my RA folder to occupy over 100 GB of space?
   - The large size of the RA folder could be due to accumulated data from multiple project versions, backups, and temporary files. You can clean up and manage this space more efficiently by deleting unnecessary files and versions.
   
2. How can I efficiently delete unnecessary versions or extra files?
   - To efficiently delete unnecessary versions or files, you can use the tools within Studio 5000 to manage project versions and clean up unused files. Be sure to back up important data before deleting anything.</p>
