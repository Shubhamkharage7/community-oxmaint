                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, we are currently in the process of demolishing some outdated GE Fanuc plc's. Unfortunately, we do not have a means of accessing the old DOS Logicmaster Series 5 and 6 ladder programs. Is there a way to convert these programs into a PDF format so that we can identify the I/O connections? We do not require online access for this. I have tried running the DOS software on different platforms, but I keep receiving an error message prompting me to use the original disks' DOS version (DOS 3.2). I have successfully set up a virtual machine with DOS 3.2 as the operating system, yet the error persists.</p>

            <p>If you're seeing the first jpg error message stating that LM6 cannot locate the appropriate ANSI.sys file, refer to the README.LM6 documentation included in your LM6 installation. It's essential to have the proper configurations in the CONFIG.SYS file for LM6 to function correctly, including setting parameters like buffers=5, files=20, and loading the device=ansi.sys driver. Do you know which version of LM6 you are attempting to run? Make sure to check and adjust your CONFIG.SYS settings accordingly.</p>

            <p>There is a limited number of Series Six machines still in operation. I recently sold my Workmaster II to one of the few remaining users in New England. If you previously utilized a Workmaster II with a parallel WSI card, it is important to note that you will require a CCM module in the Series Six for serial communications. Additionally, you will need the serial version of LM6 and run DOSBox on a 32-bit computer. Please keep in mind that the series 90 driver is not compatible with a 64-bit machine, so it is unlikely that the Series Six driver will work either.</p>

            <p>Steve Bailey mentioned that there are not many Series Sixes still in use, including his former Workmaster II which he sold to one of the last users in New England. If you previously used a Workmaster II with a parallel WSI card, you will need a CCM module in the Series Six for serial communications and the serial version of LM6. Additionally, you will need to run DOSBox on a 32-bit computer as the Series 90 driver is not compatible with a 64-bit machine. It is uncertain if the Series Six driver will work on a 64-bit computer. 

I recently obtained the LM6 software and manuals from CIMTECH and attempted to set up a virtual machine on a 64-bit computer using DOSBox in VirtualBox. However, I am experiencing difficulties with files not appearing in my virtual floppy drive. Should I switch to a 32-bit machine to resolve this issue? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Validate Serial Communication in DOSBox with LM6 Software

In a recent discussion, Steve Bailey mentioned running DOSBox on a 32-bit XP VMWare virtual machine within a 64-bit Windows 10 environment. To check the communication signal from a PC using LM6 software, is it possible to test the software and hardware functionality without connecting to the PLC? This would help in ensuring smooth testing processes and minimizing back-and-forth trips to the PLC for testing purposes.</p>

            <p>When activating Logicmaster to connect online with the PLC, a message is sent through the serial port to establish a connection. If your serial cable features traffic indicator LEDs, you will notice the transmission line LED flashing. If your cable lacks LEDs, consider connecting it to another device with a terminal emulator such as Hyperterminal to check for received characters. This troubleshooting step can help to identify any potential communication issues.</p>
