                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I own a Lenovo Thinkpad laptop running Windows 10 that does not have built-in Bluetooth capability. I have a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with a Bluetooth communication device that I am trying to connect to the laptop. I have purchased a USB dongle version 5.0 for this purpose. However, I am encountering issues as my mobile phone successfully connects to the laptop using this USB dongle, and the PLC's Bluetooth communication device can connect to the mobile phone via Bluetooth as well. Unfortunately, the PLC is not able to communicate with the laptop through the USB dongle. The system recognizes the PLC but is unable to establish a connection. I would appreciate any assistance on resolving this connectivity problem.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The Fatek PLC's B2C Bluetooth communication device was running on version 2.0, whereas the USB dongle was on version 5.0. By replacing the newer version USB dongle (V5.0) with an older version (V2.0), I successfully resolved the communication problem. This simple swap saved the day and restored seamless communication between devices.</p>
