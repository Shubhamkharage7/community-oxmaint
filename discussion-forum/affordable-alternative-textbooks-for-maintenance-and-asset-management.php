                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am seeking assistance regarding my MSc course. I have been given recommendations for two textbooks on a broad subject, but they are quite pricey at over £100.00. It's interesting to note that these textbooks are authored by one of my course lecturers. I am searching for a more affordable alternative that covers essential topics like life cycle costs, maintenance department organization, performance metrics, plant acquisition strategies, maintainability, TPM, RCM, and other management methodologies. Can anyone suggest a cheaper option that meets these criteria? Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

            <p>I can relate to the frustration you might be feeling while taking a course, especially as a beginner. If you're looking for a comprehensive guide to help you navigate through the material, I recommend checking out "Uptime" by the late John Dixon Campbell. This book provides a good overview that can be beneficial for your learning journey. Best regards.</p>
