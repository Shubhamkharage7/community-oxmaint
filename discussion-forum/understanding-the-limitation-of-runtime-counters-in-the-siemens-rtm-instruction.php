            <p>Previously, the runtime meter information was easily accessible in the technical specifications of S7-300 CPUs, such as the CPU 312C which had only one runtime meter. Strangely, this information seems to be elusive when it comes to the S7-1200. The only snippet I managed to uncover states that the CPU can operate up to 10 runtime hour meters to monitor critical control subsystems. Each timer needs to be initiated with an RTM execution, with all hour meters halting when the CPU transitions from running to stopped. Additionally, individual timers can be stopped using RTM execution mode 2. For more details, refer to page 344 of the S7-1200 system manual at the provided link: https://cache.industry.siemens.com/...95681/v1/s71200_system_manual_en-US_en-US.pdf</p>

            <p>The limit of 10 is set because it is the maximum allowed with a 1200 series. The counting starts from 0 and goes up to 9, with an error occurring at 10. Here is the information from the manual regarding the NR Input: I, Q, M, D, L, or a constant. The numbering begins at 0. It includes the Parameter RET_VAL, Error code (W#16#...), and its explanation. Error codes include 0000 for no error, 8080 for the wrong number for the operating hours counter, 8081 for passing a negative value to the PV parameter, 8082 for overflow of the operating hours counter, and 8091 for an invalid value in the MODE input parameter.

            <p>Thank you, gentlemen. I was curious why there is a limit of only 10. I reached out to tech support to gain insight into whether this limitation is due to software or hardware. The restrictions on high-speed counters are a result of hardware limitations, as each CPU has its own unique limits and hardware design. Similarly, the limit on the number of blocks is due to memory constraints, as there is a finite amount of memory available. These limitations are important to consider when designing systems for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>According to JRW, tech support doesn't involve designing products - their role is solely to provide support.

            <p>The arbitrary limit set by firmware developers, possibly due to limitations of their own perception based on having 10 fingers, may leave users questioning the reasoning behind it. Perhaps if the limit had been set as a multiple of 8, it would have seemed more fitting. Companies like Siemens, Rockwell, Schneider, and Omron are so large that the gap between tech support and development teams can sometimes hinder effective communication. It's possible that a tech support representative may not have the ability to answer every question, especially if caught on a bad day. In the end, encountering unanswerable questions is a common occurrence that can happen in any industry.</p>

            <p>Kamenges suggests that the limit on instances was likely set arbitrarily by the firmware developer, possibly due to personal limitations or preferences. However, it would have been more convenient if the limit had been a multiple of 8. On the other hand, Keith believes that there is a valid reason behind the limit, such as ensuring accuracy or managing writing hours to the memory card. After reaching 10 real-time monitors, there is a library available on the Siemens website for the 1200/1500 series for downloading runtime blocks.</p>

            <p>As JRW originally mentioned, there must be a logical explanation for this situation. When you discover the reason, please return to this discussion and share an update. Curious individuals are eager to know the answer. It seems unbelievable that a PLC product line known for surpassing Rockwell's top products would struggle with processing power or memory limitations to the point where it can only handle 10 time delta sums at once. If performance and memory constraints are not the issue, what other factors could be at play here? Keith, we look forward to your insights.</p>

            <p>Posted by PLC: Why was it decided to have a maximum of 16 Profinet devices for a 1200? While this limit may seem arbitrary, it does have a rationale in terms of CPU and data design constraints, specifically limited by the size of a nibble. The discussion may have evolved, but the core issue remains the same. Some believe the limit is tied to an as-yet undefined performance metric, while I think it's purely a result of humans typically thinking in base 10. Ultimately, there seems to be no real justification for this limit, which was the original question that got lost in the shuffle of responses from Siemens tech support.
Originally posted by mass89: My experience with Siemens support has always been positive; they are among the most responsive and reliable. It's likely that the OP just encountered a support representative having a bad day with a question they couldn't answer, which can understandably be frustrating. Like I mentioned earlier, it's probably just an isolated incident.Keith</p>

            <p>In retrospect, I should have started my first post with "Why" instead of "Where." I admit I overlooked the RTM instruction in the past, dismissing it as restrictive without fully understanding its limitations. However, after a recent discussion in a forum, I realized the importance of seeking clarification from knowledgeable individuals. While I had a negative experience with Siemens support previously, I must commend their proactive approach to providing free technical support and managing forums, which undoubtedly enhances the value of their products. Access to documentation and application examples is commendable as well. However, there have been instances where tech support responses have been unhelpful, redirecting users to the manual or forums. This issue seems to be recurring and may be attributed to varying levels of support expertise. Following a disappointing encounter with a local distributor last year, I am reminded not to rely solely on one source for assistance.</p>

            <p>It is possible that there is a deliberate effort to encourage upgrading to the S7-1500 for more advanced features. Similarly, certain functions may only be accessible on the comfort line of HMIs, rather than the basic line. It is highly likely that these functions could be made available on the basic line as well. This is reminiscent of how cars come with all features but require payment to unlock them.</p>

Similar to how certain features are restricted on the basic HMI line but available on the comfort line, it is likely that many functions could potentially be unlocked on the basic line. This situation can be compared to cars where all features exist, but additional payment is required to access them. It is worth noting that even though there is a push towards upgrading to the S7-1500, it only offers 16 HW run time meters. The need for CPU-based runtime tracking in hardware raises questions considering the trend towards software-based solutions. The fact that the S7-1500 only offers as many runtime meters as the 400s (16) is worth considering.</p>

            <p>In the tech community, there is a trend towards pushing users to upgrade from a 1200 to a 1500 model. However, even the 1500 model only offers 16 hardware runtime meters. This raised a question for me: do people still rely on the CPU for runtime tracking in hardware? I had assumed that this function was primarily for legacy use and that software now handles it. It is interesting to note that the 1500 model, like the 400s, also has 16 runtime meters. It seems that these functions are becoming less common in modern technology. I must admit, I have yet to come across these runtime tracking functions myself.</p>

            <p>To ensure proper functionality, it is crucial to refer to the RTFM for detailed instructions. Pay close attention to the NR input parameter and the initial description of the instruction. The CPU can manage up to 10 run-time hour meters to monitor critical control subsystems. It is essential to initiate each individual hour meter with a separate RTM execution for accurate tracking of run-time hours. Remember to consult the "Fine" Manual for further guidance.</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, user drbitboy raised a thought-provoking question about optimizing CPU usage: "How many of the CPU's 10 run-time hour meters is your code utilizing?" This question may seem complex, but it highlights the importance of maximizing CPU efficiency. If you're unsure about the question, feel free to ask for clarification.</p>

            <p>dargenicx asked for clarification on the question. The Siemens S7-1200 CPU can operate up to ten Run-Time hour Meters (RTMs). The NR parameter in the RTM instruction specifies which of these ten RTMs to use. Since all RTM instructions have the same NR value (0) in the program, the CPU uses only one RTM for all instructions. Therefore, if you mentioned having multiple RTMs in your program, you should actually have only one. The PLC strictly follows the commands given to it, whether we want it to or not. Sometimes, the biggest problem is when the PLC executes commands exactly as we have instructed it to, even if it's not what we intended.</p>

            <p>In the context of PLC programming, the S7-1200 CPU features ten Run-Time hour Meters (RTMs), with the NR input parameter determining which RTM is utilized by a specific instruction. By setting NR to 0 across all RTM instructions, the CPU defaults to using only one RTM for all operations. To clarify, stating "I have more than one RTM in my program" would be more accurate as "I have only one RTM in my program." It's important to note that a PLC strictly follows programmed instructions, regardless of intentions, ultimately executing tasks as directed. To address the issue of multiple RTMs, assigning distinct NR values such as 0, 1, 2, and 3 to each RTM resolves any inconsistencies and ensures proper functionality.</p>
