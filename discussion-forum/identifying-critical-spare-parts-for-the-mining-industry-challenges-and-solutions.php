                    <p>Currently, I am engaged in a project focused on identifying critical spare parts for the mining industry. I have explored several methodologies commonly used across various sectors, such as manufacturing and service providers, to determine which parts are critical.

I am seeking suggestions and ideas on developing a tool or matrix specifically tailored to determine critical spare parts for mining operations. An assessment I conducted revealed a mix of methods, leading to some confusion. Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the restaurant industry and various types of machines, the need for proper equipment maintenance is crucial. For instance, if a restaurant constantly runs out of forks throughout the day, it indicates a need for either a more efficient dishwasher or simply more forks. I prioritize critical spare parts that are essential for avoiding delays in production, preventing potential losses, ensuring emergency plans can be executed, and ultimately safeguarding job security. In addition, I have devised an emergency action plan that details all necessary parts, their respective vendors, and estimated turnaround times in case of a disaster like a tornado hitting the plant. This meticulous planning justifies the importance of having a list of critical spare parts readily available. Ultimately, the question comes down to how much money a business is willing to risk losing in terms of lost productivity due to equipment failure. By providing concrete figures and proposals, decision-makers can confidently say yes or no, thus shifting the responsibility for any financial losses onto them in case of emergency situations.</p>

            <p>Identifying critical spare parts is crucial for reducing maintenance costs. One approach is to consider all insurance spares as critical, along with essential parts designated in budget codes. Another method is to conduct Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) studies for pinpointing critical spares. While examples may be scarce, literature suggests that this approach is feasible. Your input on this topic would be valuable.</p>

            <p>Having a history of spare parts usage can make inventory management easier. By conducting an ABC analysis, you categorize inventory based on cost and quantity, allowing you to prioritize critical items in terms of both value and turnover. Additionally, maintaining a critical list comprising only 1% of total inventory ensures that essential spares are always available to prevent disruptions in production.</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, let's break it down for you: Category "A" accounts for 75-80% of the total value and 10-15% of the line items. Category "B" represents 10-15% of the total value and 20-25% of the line items. Lastly, Category "C" makes up 5-10% of the total value and a whopping 60-65% of the line items.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with Just's suggestion of conducting a cost/benefit analysis. One valuable tool for this analysis is APT spares, which calculates the cost of not having a spare part by multiplying the risk and consequence. The risk includes the rate of failure and potential catastrophic scenarios. The consequence is influenced by factors such as twinning, market conditions, and goodwill. It is also important to consider mitigating factors, such as implementing a vibration monitoring program to increase procurement time. Visit http://www.aptools.co.uk/papers/stockholding.pdf for a detailed discussion on factors to consider when deciding on stockholding.</p>

            <p>When deciding on critical spare parts, two main factors come into play: defining what constitutes a critical spare and determining whether to stock the item. In my view, a critical spare is a component essential for plant operation, with no feasible substitute available. Feasible alternatives may include sourcing from a nearby vendor or temporarily using a different component or process pathway. Stocking decisions should be made based on a risk assessment, taking into account the likelihood and impact of failure, along with the component cost. From my industry experience, a simple comparison of component cost to downtime expenses often leads to overstocking and unnecessary costs.</p>
