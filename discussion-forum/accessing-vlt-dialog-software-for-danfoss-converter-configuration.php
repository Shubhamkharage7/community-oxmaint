            <p>Upgrade your dialog software from the outdated 16-bit version to the new and improved 32-bit VLT Dialog 3.xx, available at Danfoss (www.danfoss.com). With a size of over 27mb, this software is a wise investment that won't break the bank. Make sure to regularly visit Danfoss's website for free updates, with version 3.08 currently being the latest release.</p>

            <p>I am in search of the VLT Dialog software, also known as Dialogue by Danfoss. After reaching out to Danfoss tech support for assistance, they tried to provide me with the software, which was spread across 6 floppy disks. Unfortunately, one of the floppies was missing. The version they had available was the 16-bit DOS version. If you happen to have either the 16-bit or 32-bit version of Dialog, Danfoss tech support would greatly appreciate receiving it. Feel free to contact them at [email protected]</p>

            <p>Hello Bob! Last March, I departed from my role at Danfoss Drives Level 2 support in Denmark. I distinctly remember leaving the zip files for Dialog with my colleague before I left.

            <p>Hello Michal! Thank you for your help. If you come across the software and share the link, I will pass it along to the Danfoss representatives in the United States. If you are unable to find it, I may reach out to Danfoss in Denmark for assistance. I recently received an email from Danfoss US tech support with a list of global tech support contacts. All the email addresses were valid, so I am considering sending the request to all of them as they made an effort to assist me. Considering there is 480VAC in the enclosure, I am contemplating upgrading from the old single-phase 230VAC VLT 2010 to a new 3-phase 480 VAC VFD for our 30-year-old machine. However, the documentation does not list any drive parameters, so it would be beneficial to retrieve them. We only use the machine sporadically, about once or twice a year.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Does the drive feature a basic 1-line LED display? The Danfoss drives I have encountered typically have a straightforward display and user-friendly buttons for easy parameter access. While it may take some time to navigate through the parameters, it is still preferable to not having any parameter values at all. It is possible that the drives I have worked with were newer models than the one you are currently handling.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The Danfoss VLT 2010 features a two-line LCD display, however, it appears to be malfunctioning. Despite the drive powering up and the red fault light being illuminated, the display segments are displaying gibberish. This issue raises doubts about the software's ability to connect and extract parameters, but it is worth attempting. Our 30-year-old drive is utilized in equipment for limited production biannually. The VLT 2000 series, introduced in 1992 by Danfoss, was succeeded by the VLT 5000 series in 1995 and the VLT 2800 series in 1998. The VLT 2800 manual still mentions the Dialog software, indicating possible backward compatibility with the 2800 series.</p>

            <p>If the display is not functioning, it's possible that you may be out of luck. However, it's worth attempting to extract parameters from the drive regardless. Have you attempted to do so using the VLT2800 series software? This software should still be accessible through Danfoss, as the production of VLT2800 drives only ceased last year.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your hard work, Michal. We decided to swap out the outdated Danfoss VLT 2010 drive with a Powerflex 525 drive from our inventory. By referencing the system manual and specifications, we successfully replicated the functionality of the original VLT drive. This upgrade marks the completion of replacing all the old VLTs in our facility.</p>

            <p>Hello Bob! In March of this year, I departed from my role at Danfoss Drives Level 2 support in Denmark. I remember leaving the Dialog zip files with my colleague before leaving. Unfortunately, it seems that the team in the US hasn't been able to locate them. I will check to see if I have a spare copy saved somewhere. 

Hi Michal, I'm in search of that particular software. Is there a chance that you still have it accessible? Whether it's a physical copy or if you can upload it to a cloud service again, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Great job, Vosay! I successfully downloaded the Dialog software using the link you provided. After unzipping it, I ran the software in the included DOSbox and it worked perfectly. I didn't attempt to connect it to a drive, so please keep me updated if you manage to connect it to a VLT drive. Here is the link to the Dialog software shared by Danfoss Support. It consists of 6 floppy disks designed for installation on a 16-bit DOS system. I remember trying to install it before, but I believe one of the disks was missing. Access the software here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XM6Inosokkp-05JT7k3PHWwwqc-EaSF5/view?usp=sharing.</p>

            <p>Absolutely, I successfully operated it as instructed by connecting a standard USB-RS485 interface to pins 68 and 69 of a VLT 3006 drive. I was able to efficiently read and print parameters without any issues.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am in need of urgently backing up parameters for my VLT 2800. Can anyone share the VLT Dialog 3 software and/or VLT Software Dialog with me via Google Drive or mega.nz? Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>The VLT Software Dialog is obsolete and has been superseded by MCT-10. You can easily access and download this upgraded software for free from the official website. I successfully linked up to my VLT 2800 with the newest version of MCT-10 just yesterday, and everything ran smoothly.</p>

            <p>Azcz mentioned that the VLT Software Dialog is now obsolete, as it has been substituted by MCT-10. The newest version of MCT-10 can be downloaded for free from the official website. Recently, Azcz successfully connected to a VLT 2800 drive with the updated MCT-10 software. Can you please provide a step-by-step guide on how to connect to the VLT 2800?

            <p>Ibrahimz inquired about connecting to the VLT 2800 drive and requested a step-by-step guide. To connect to the drive, you will need to download and install MCT-10, the VLT® Motion Control Tool. This tool allows for drive configuration and updates from a PC. A USB to RS 485 converter, such as the ICP Con 7561, is required for the connection. After installing the driver for the converter, select it in the connection settings of MCT-10. Then, connect the USB converter to terminals 68-69 on the VLT 2800 drive, supply power to the drive, and press "Communication - Scan / Refresh" in the program to establish communication. For more information, visit the official Danfoss website.</p>
