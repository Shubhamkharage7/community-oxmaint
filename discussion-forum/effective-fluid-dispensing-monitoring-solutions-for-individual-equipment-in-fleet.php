                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am in search of a solution to effectively monitor fluid dispensing for our equipment fleet on an individual equipment basis. Does anyone have any knowledge about a meter that prompts for information prior to fluid dispensing? My main objective is to accurately record the amount of gallons being distributed to each machine. Dependence on a physical log book is not feasible due to our assets being shared across departments and shifts. Currently, we have two fluid topping methods in place - one fixed and one mobile. Two different departments utilize the same fluid source, while two departments utilize the mobile unit for dispensing.</p>

            <p>In today's era of mobile computing, streamlining your fleet maintenance process can be easily achieved without breaking the bank. One cost-effective solution is to utilize a shared spreadsheet on Google Docs for real-time tracking. By having mobile devices input fleet equipment numbers and fluid quantities when fluids are topped up, you can keep a comprehensive log of maintenance activities. Google Docs allows for multiple users to update the document simultaneously, making collaboration seamless.

Moreover, incorporating barcode scanner technology into the spreadsheet can further simplify the data entry process for technicians. Many mobile devices come equipped with barcode readers, enabling technicians to scan barcodes and directly input fluid quantities. Additionally, there are mobile versions of CMMS systems available that support remote reporting functionalities, similar to what you are seeking. For example, Mobile Maximo can be used to report maintenance activities to the Global Instance of Maximo.

Technicians can conveniently use handheld units, similar to those used by delivery services like UPS and FedEx, to upload information periodically. This integrated approach leverages the power of mobile technology to streamline fleet maintenance procedures efficiently.</p>
