Some people have mentioned that the questions can be time-consuming to solve. I haven't taken the exam myself yet, so I'd appreciate any insights you can provide. I'm planning to take the exam soon.

            <p>The exam was quite lengthy and some of the questions were tricky. However, with a strong knowledge base, you can easily complete 90 to 95% of the exam. Approximately 10% of the questions were challenging and difficult to understand. It is essential to have a diverse range of knowledge in areas such as project management, planning, vibration analysis, lubrication, and equipment reliability. I am confident that Mr. Steev will have no issues passing the exam, given his experience in the field.</p>

            <p>quote: Steve Turner congratulated Vishal on passing the exam on the first try and asked for any tips for the forum. Steve inquired about time management during the exam, as some find certain questions to be time-consuming. Since Steve has not taken the exam yet, he is seeking advice from those with first-hand experience. Vishal advised Steve to manage time wisely during the exam, recommending prioritizing easy questions first and then tackling more challenging ones. Vishal recalled finishing the exam with 15 minutes to spare, but noted that this was several years ago and the exam format may have changed since then. Steve, make sure to stay updated on any changes by renewing certifications through published papers and conference attendance.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve, when I took the exam in December, I found myself in a similar situation as Kris. There were 4 questions that initially stumped me, so I skipped them and focused on the ones that aligned with my experience. After going back to the remaining questions, I carefully worked through them, marked my answers, tallied my marks, and handed in my paper with plenty of time to spare. To prepare for the exam, I recommend checking out the reading list on the SMRP website to gauge your readiness by relating it to your own experience. This approach to test-taking is something I used to teach my students when I was an educator. Ken Culverson CMRP.</p>
