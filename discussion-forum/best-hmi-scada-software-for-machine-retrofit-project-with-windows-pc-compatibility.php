                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am currently working on a machine retrofit project and in search of HMI/SCADA software recommendations. While I have experience with C-More and Horner HMIs in the past, I now require more functionality for the current project and prefer software that can run on a Windows PC rather than proprietary hardware. The machine will be equipped with 1 or 2 PLCs and 1 on-machine HMI. I am aware of the wide variety of software available and am looking for something user-friendly and cost-effective (ideally priced between $0 to $5,000 for one HMI with less than 1500 tags).

For the current project, two key requirements are essential. Firstly, the operator must be able to open a file selection window to access a cutlist over the network, which will then be loaded onto the HMI and subsequently transferred to the PLC. Additionally, I aim to incorporate basic visualizations on the HMI such as dynamically drawn simple shapes based on the dimensions provided by the cutlist.

I would appreciate any insights or recommendations you may have regarding this matter. Thank you in advance! ~Jason</p>

            <p>When looking for a software solution like Inductive Automation Ignition, it's important to consider your specific needs and the size of your operation. While Ignition is commonly recommended for larger installations, there are also smaller editions available. Personally, I have a preference for Indusoft Web Studio, now known as Aveva Edge due to acquisitions and marketing. 

Before making a decision, it's essential to ask yourself a few key questions: 
1. Which scripting or programming languages do you have experience with, such as Python, Visual Basic, or C++? 
2. Will you require mobile device access or the ability to easily scale your display across multiple screens and computers? 
3. In what format is your "cutlist" available? 
4. Can you provide examples of the simple dimensioned shapes you need to visualize onscreen?

Considering these factors will help you choose the right software for your specific requirements.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After testing the Ignition demo, I find it user-friendly yet powerful. While it is designed for large systems, our focus is on machine control HMIs for specific machines. We aim for flexibility and power, without the complexity and high cost associated with proprietary HMIs. 

1. My programming knowledge is limited to some C++ and Python.  
2. We do not require mobile access, possibly only utilizing two computers in the future.  
3. The cutlist will be in text format and needs to be parsed by either the HMI or PLC. I am considering customizing the cutlist for JSON format. A sample cutlist file will be provided from the customer's design software.  
4. Attached is a printout of the truss component saw we are retrofitting. I aim to display individual components visually, mirroring the current paper-based operation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I first started using Fix Dynamics in the 1980s before transitioning to Fix32 on NT4.0. The scripting capabilities were user-friendly and efficient. Rumor has it that the original Fix platform was created by ex-Foxboro DCS professionals. However, after being sold, iFix was introduced, but did not receive favorable feedback due to its complexity compared to the simplicity of Visual Basic. As a result, we decided to switch to Wonderware for our system needs.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After its recent split, iFix is undergoing a transformation to stay relevant in the market. However, I am finding it challenging to navigate the changes and am considering making the switch to Ignition. If I don't make the transition before I leave, the next person may opt for Factory Talk instead. It seems like it's time for me to move on from iFix.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>After experiencing numerous issues with iFix, I have decided to move on. Following its acquisition by Emerson to serve as the HMI platform for DeltaV, there were various graphic problems that arose. Emerson often pointed fingers at iFix for these issues. Despite being on Version 11, iFix was still being used, with promises to eventually phase it out. However, it is unclear if this transition has taken place. Our investment in multicore processor operator stations proved to be futile as they kept crashing, leading to the necessity of operating on single cores. Overall, my experience with iFix has been highly disappointing, and I would rate it as a negative number on a scale of 1-10.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to upgrade your AVEVA (Wonderware) Intouch software from its 1990's version to the latest 2023 version (possibly Version 12), iFix is the ideal solution. With just two intermediate upgrade steps, you can seamlessly update your software without the need for rebuilding any components. Say goodbye to the hassle of complex upgrades with iFix.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>NetNathan criticized iFix, particularly its upgrade process. AVEVA's (Wonderware) Intouch software can be easily upgraded from the first version in the 1990s to the latest 2023 version (Version 12?) with just two intermediate steps. The alarm handler underwent a change between 2009 and 2012, affecting the query structure, although the impact was relatively minor. This has been a common complaint about AVEVA, as since Schneider Electric's acquisition, Intouch has been integrated into an IDE and archestra graphics, resulting in unnecessary bloat. Despite this, the core Intouch engine has remained unchanged for two decades.</p>

            <p>robertmee mentioned a change in the Alarm handler between 2009 and 2012, leading to alterations in the query structure. Despite being relatively minor, this transformation reflects a common complaint about Wonderware (WW). Following Schneider Electric's acquisition by Aveva, Intouch was integrated into an IDE and archestra graphics, resulting in a bloated system. However, the core Intouch engine has remained unchanged for the past 20 years. The recent releases of 2023 and 2023 R2 have introduced some peculiar quirks during setup, making some users hesitant about the evolving cross-reference capabilities.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>NetNathan mentioned that there have been issues with Bloat in the software. However, Intouch has maintained its stability. While 2023 and 2023 R2 versions have had some unusual quirks during setup, many users are not pleased with the changes in the cross-reference feature. The cross-reference and unused tags have been dysfunctional since 2017, especially when using dbload. To fix this issue, users are advised to open all windows, scripts, etc., make a small change (which can be undone with ctrl-z), and save each window and script. Running the unused report will then update all indices accurately. Though this process can be tedious, it is preferable to accidentally deleting a crucial "unused tag" that may cause corruption in the window where it is actually utilized.</p>

            <p>While many people have not discussed Movicon, it is a software system that I have experience with, having used various systems like FactoryLink, iFix, RSV, AFE, and others. Although I have not implemented Movicon in an actual project, I have worked on development for four projects. I found Movicon to be incredibly impressive - it is scalable, user-friendly, yet powerful. While I wasn't a fan of the I/O drivers, I mainly used Kepware which I prefer. Initially, I faced some challenges with scripting, but after finding information on their website, I quickly overcame them.</p>

They were also exploring pricing options from Ignition and Wonderware AVEVA System Platform, although obtaining quotes without trial usage proved challenging. Ignition stands out for its pricing structure, with all clients being free and payment only required for the gateway and drivers. Having experience with both platforms, Ignition is comparable to a Tesla while AVEVA's performance is likened to a Pinto.</p>
