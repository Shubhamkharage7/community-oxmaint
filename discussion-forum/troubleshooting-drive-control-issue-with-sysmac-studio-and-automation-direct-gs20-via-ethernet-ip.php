            <p>When analyzing instance 100 in the system, I noticed that both bits 0.1 and 0.4 are activated when I transfer word 18. I experimented with transferring individual bits and the entire word, focusing on both RUN FWD and RUN REV operations. However, the VFD did not respond to any operations. The same scenario played out when I examined instance 101 (Monitor) - when adjusting VFD settings from keypad controls to Eip control, bits 1.8 and 1.10 were triggered, indicating that the VFD communicated with the PLC. These signals ceased when I reverted back to keypad control. Additionally, when running the VFD via the keypad, the PLC displayed activation of bits 1.0, 1.1 (for RUN), and bit 1.12 (indicating VFD operation).</p>

            <p>If the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is showing 0Hz even though the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is sending a 60Hz command, it may be due to an incorrect configuration setting in the VFD.
