                    <p>Hello everyone, 

As part of the EU Project RIMAP (Risk-Based Inspection and Maintenance Procedure), project members are currently focusing on comparing best practices for handling maintenance backlog in a risk-based manner. One concern is that delayed maintenance planning may conflict with other daily routines, necessitating risk criteria to prioritize tasks and avoid backlogging non-risky tasks. 

We are interested in hearing about any specific schemes you have used in your plant (according to Corporate rules or plant practices) as well as the risk criteria employed in such situations. 

Best regards,
Bernard</p>

            <p>Hello Bernard, I recommend the following steps to effectively manage maintenance backlog based on risk ranking. First, prioritize all maintenance work (preventive, corrective, or detective) according to their risk level. Next, create a Pareto curve by ranking the work based on risk level (X-axis) and manhours required (Y-axis). Ideally, high priority tasks should account for 5-10% of total manhours, medium priority for 20-25%, and low priority for 65-75%. Regularly update this prioritization (preferably weekly) to align with operational needs. For preventive tasks, aim to complete high priority work within +/-10% of the scheduled date, with medium priority within 25% and low priority within 50%. Corrective work, identified through condition monitoring or breakdowns, should be prioritized accordingly. By following these guidelines and ensuring adequate staffing levels, backlog can be effectively managed in most cases. Share your own practices and risk criteria for handling maintenance backlog in your plant. Best regards, Bernard.</p>

            <p>After implementing a concept from an old maintenance management book by Herbaty, we have seen significant success over the past 9-10 months. According to our system, a deferred job is essentially a task that needs to be scheduled in. We have introduced a priority system for these deferred jobs, consisting of three levels. Our scheduler always prioritizes filling in higher priority deferred jobs, as long as the estimated duration of the task aligns with the schedule. In cases where a higher priority deferred job cannot fit in, any suitable deferred job can be utilized to fill the gap. It is possible for lower priority deferred jobs to get overlooked and never make it onto the schedule. Regular audits, initially set at three months, assist in identifying such cases. It is crucial to make a decision about these tasks, whether adjusting the priority, outsourcing the job, or dismissing it altogether. Proper assessment is key in managing these deferred jobs effectively.</p>

            <p>Hello Bernard,

I have achieved significant success by employing risk matrices for ongoing projects integrated within the Work Order priority system. Building on Vee's insights, Work Order priorities are structured to reflect both the potential severity of consequences if no action is taken and the acceptable timeframe before failure becomes "intolerable". While this may sound complex, in reality, it is quite straightforward and easy to navigate. This approach allows for a systematic and logical prioritization of work orders, providing a level of control over ongoing projects.

For instance, in the case of detective tasks, the frequency of these tasks is determined by the acceptable level of risk tolerance. By executing these tasks within a specified timeframe, we can effectively manage our risk within the predefined tolerance levels. If a task exceeds its designated timeframe, it indicates that we are surpassing our acceptable risk threshold, putting us in a position of unnecessary risk.

Similarly, prioritization methods like these, when rigorously implemented and monitored through graphical reports like "Priority versus time," have proven to be successful. These reports not only track the number of work orders but also identify those that have pushed the organization beyond its acceptable risk limits. This approach also aids in managing general backlog, albeit a broader aspect.

I hope this explanation clarifies your query. Please feel free to reach out for further information.

            <p>Implementing a risk-based approach to selecting work tasks is a valuable concept that is relatively new in our organization. Our plant work management process follows a simple format to prioritize tasks effectively. This includes: 
1) Priority 1 - addressing urgent issues such as HSE or production losses that require immediate attention, like plant or equipment malfunctions. 
2) Priority 2 - addressing potential HSE or production losses that need to be resolved within 24 hours, such as problems identified during maintenance. 
3) Priority 3 - non-urgent tasks with no immediate impact on HSE or production, to be completed within 2 weeks for proper planning. 
4) Priority 4 - low-value or general tasks to be completed within 1 month if they cannot be eliminated. 
5) Priority 5 - tasks for turnaround or shutdown activities. 
Backlog jobs are then categorized as good or bad. Good backlog jobs are actively planned and scheduled for execution, while bad backlog jobs require expediting due to constraints like operational requirements or resource availability. Utilizing a CMMS can streamline the listing of work orders and eliminate manual recording.
Risk-based work selection is crucial for tasks with priorities 1, 2, and 5, as well as for optimizing turnaround intervals and durations. By assessing risks, turnaround intervals can be extended if deemed acceptable, and maintenance frequency for specific machinery can be adjusted. Additionally, work on spared equipment can be strategically timed around turnarounds or evenly spread out during normal operations. Ultimately, a risk-based approach adds value to maintenance work by prioritizing tasks and preventing unnecessary activities. We look forward to reviewing your RBIM procedure. Thank you.</p>
