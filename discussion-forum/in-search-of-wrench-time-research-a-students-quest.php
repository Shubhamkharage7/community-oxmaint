                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Seeking Assistance with Wrench Time Research - Hi there! I am a student working on my certificate project focusing on wrench time. Unfortunately, finding literature on this topic has proven to be quite challenging. It seems that there are no books dedicated to wrench time in Germany. Therefore, I am reaching out for help. If anyone is aware of any resources pertaining to wrench time, please let me know. So far, I have come across "Wrench Time, Using the RPM Method" by Fred Weber and "Maintenance Planning and Scheduling Handbook" by Richard D. Palmer. My goal is to define "wrench time" and locate relevant studies. However, my search has been fruitless so far, both in terms of books and online resources. Does anyone know of a company conducting studies on this topic or where I can find more information? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help. - Alexa</p>
