                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Dear all,

We are currently dealing with high levels of vibration in a screw compressor at a 660MW thermal power plant. The compressor's vibration reached 22mm/s RMS on January 25th. Despite cleaning the air and oil filters, the vibration remains elevated. After these maintenance actions, the vibration has decreased to 19mm/s RMS. I have attached various spectrum and trend analyses for reference. Unfortunately, I do not have any additional information to provide at this time.

            <p>Hello Mr. Vishal, thank you for your recent post. I would appreciate more information regarding the compressor rating speed, whether it is belt driven or direct, the motor speed, power, and pulley ratio. Additionally, we are interested in the Orders of 1X. The peaks observed seem to be non-synchronous and do not indicate any unique components of the compressor. It would be beneficial to obtain the DE and NDE triaxial FFT for a more detailed analysis. According to your observation, cleaning the filters on the Air and Oil side resulted in a reduction of vibration levels from 22 to 19 mm/s RMS. I recommend checking the oil condition, belt condition, pulley tightness, and grooves to ensure optimal performance. Thank you for your attention to these matters. Best regards, Chary</p>

            <p>When examining the motor RPM of 1500 in a direct couple drive system, despite cleaning the oil filter and air filter, high levels of vibration persist. Attached is the axial spectrum of the compressor drive and NDE side for further analysis. Download the PDF file "compressor.pdf" (59 KB) for detailed information.</p>
