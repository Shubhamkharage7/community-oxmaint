            <p>It is highly likely that you will encounter requests for various programming languages such as LAD, ST, FBD, and SCL as an OEM or systems house programmer. In a production environment, versatility is key - even if your company has a preferred language, you may need to work with a standard system to reduce costs. It is important not to restrict yourself to just one platform like Siemens, as diversifying your skills will increase your employability in the job market.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>05-08-2024</span></li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to logic operations, I personally find LAD to be the most user-friendly. For instance, it is easy to perform operations like AND and OR with contacts in LAD programming. On the other hand, SCL can be a bit more complicated as it typically requires a minimum of three lines of code using IF-THEN, the actual code, and END_IF statements. However, SCL excels when it comes to complex calculations compared to LAD.

Therefore, it is beneficial to learn SCL in addition to LAD, although it should be noted that SCL is not your typical programming language. It is advisable to use a combination of programming languages based on the requirements of your project. Fortunately, with TIA (Totally Integrated Automation), you have the flexibility to integrate an SCL rung within a LAD program, allowing you to mix and match languages seamlessly. This provides you with the best of both worlds in terms of programming capabilities.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>According to BryanG, SCL can be challenging due to its requirement of a minimum of three lines of code using IF-THEN, code, and END_IF. However, SCL is superior to LAD for calculations. It's important to note that a rung in SCL is not the same as an IF-THEN statement. For example, coilResult := ThisContact AND ThatContact OR ThatCondition is a code snippet that does not involve an IF statement. Troubleshooting digital logic in SCL may not be perfect, and visual languages may be easier to work with. Siemens allows for language definition per rung, while other platforms may require creating blocks to implement SCL logic, which excels in calculations and array-based logic/loops. Additionally, it is beneficial to also learn CFC or Rockwell FBD, powerful languages that differ from Siemens FBD.</p>

            <p>When programming for S7-300/400, I suggest allocating 30% of the code to Ladder Diagram (LAD) and 70% to Structured Control Language (SCL). This distribution is necessary because S7-300/400 has limitations in LAD that can be overcome with SCL, such as indirect addressing, looping, and multiple data views using the 'AT' method. For more complex tasks in S7-300/400, one would typically turn to Statement List (STL) or SCL.

In contrast, S7-1200/1500 eliminates these limitations, allowing for almost identical functionality in both LAD and SCL. However, SCL excels in data manipulation and looping, while LAD is preferred for its intuitive logic-building and online debugging capabilities. While SCL can become convoluted with too many brackets, LAD offers a more visual representation of logic flow.

Therefore, in S7-1200/1500 projects, I recommend a split of 70% LAD and 30% SCL to leverage the strengths of both languages. Exclusively relying on SCL may not be optimal for most projects.</p>

            <p>I concur with Jesper's sentiments. I once faced a challenging situation where the lead engineer insisted on utilizing ST (SCL), which led to various issues that resulted in prolonged coding and debugging processes. The on-site engineers were dissatisfied, and my reputation suffered, despite my explanation that it was at the behest of the chief engineer. It was a classic case of someone who wanted to appear knowledgeable and boastful. This individual constantly showcased his latest iPhone and its capabilities, to which I would casually mention that my phone also had similar features at a fraction of the cost. I'm sure many have encountered such individuals in their professional circles.</p>

            <p>Parky and Jesper both made valid points that resonate with my own experiences. I once encountered a situation where the chief engineer insisted on using ST (SCL), which led to numerous coding and debugging issues, ultimately causing delays. This is why I prefer to limit my use of SCL/STL. While I may not be an expert, I understand the importance of maintaining code in a clear and understandable format for future reference. As Jesper mentioned, LAD programming with a 1200 or 1500 PLC offers ample flexibility and functionality.</p>

            <p>During the S5 era, I primarily used STL for my coding as it was the only option for writing Function Blocks (FBs) at the time. I found STL easier to work with compared to ST (SCL) because it was quicker to input, although it could be challenging for other engineers to grasp. While I often implemented output handling in ladder program blocks, the control logic was mostly written in STL within the FBs (there were no Function Calls (FCs) back then). Despite the inconvenience of numerous brackets, which were more easily managed in ladder logic, I became proficient in STL and didn't find it problematic. I recall exclusively writing my program blocks in STL, ensuring proper bracketing and segment end commands to facilitate translation into ladder logic for faster execution. Unfortunately, FBs couldn't be visualized in ladder logic.

I have a vivid memory of someone requesting me to convert a program originally written for an S5 110, utilizing a PG675 handheld programmer. The program lacked segment end instructions, rendering it impossible to display in ladder logic. After meticulously adding the necessary segment end instructions (**** or BLD255), I successfully translated the program into ladder logic, downloaded it to the PLC, and seamlessly transitioned it to ladder logic programming.</p>

            <p>For nearly two decades, I have been proficient in programming Siemens systems. Throughout my experience, I have found that utilizing ladder logic and Function Block Diagrams (FBD) is essential. While familiarity with Structured Text (STL) and Statement List (SCL) can be beneficial, my preference is to primarily focus on ladder and FBD due to their efficiency. However, there have been occasions where knowledge of STL and SCL has been necessary, particularly when working with older codes or utilizing indirect addressing on the 300/400 platform.</p>

            <p>Back in the day, S5 FB's were exclusively programmed in STL, which is where I gained my initial experience in the early 80's. I continued to use it until 2000 and found it to be quite enjoyable. However, with advancements in technology, the necessity for STL has diminished as many functions that were previously limited to STL can now be accomplished in LAD/FBD, or whatever you prefer to call it. Despite its benefits for complex calculations, I personally do not favor ST for normal Bool code. It's worth noting that ST and STL are two distinct programming languages - ST is a structured language similar to Pascal while STL is more like assembler.

Although STL code can be easily translated into ladder logic, ST code poses a greater challenge due to its supposed portability. Many PLC functions are custom-made for specific platforms, making it difficult to seamlessly transfer ST code to different systems without extensive modification. For instance, a simple code like INT_To_Str in one PLC may need to be adjusted to Int_To_STR in another platform due to differences in letter casing. Additionally, naming conventions vary across platforms - a tag like Stop_Drive may be acceptable in one system but could cause compilation errors in another where "Stop" is a reserved keyword.</p>
