            <p>Our team utilizes a unique hybrid approach to maintenance planning. Rather than having a dedicated planner, we have a specialized 4-man team known as the Maintenance Control Center. This team consists of an experienced maintenance supervisor, a skilled computer technician, a former refinery operator, and a handyman mechanic. The Maintenance Control Center is responsible for strategic planning and oversees the entire Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). This team is often referred to as the "Internal Control" of our maintenance operations.</p>

            <p>I am interested in exploring how productivity can increase with the implementation of a dedicated maintenance planner. Currently, with 15 maintenance craftsmen working at 20%-25% wrenchtime, the question arises: how much more efficient could they be with a dedicated planner achieving 50% wrenchtime? Is there a correlation where for every 5 craftsmen, 1 planner leads to improved efficiency? Looking forward to your insights. Terry O</p>

            <p>Hello Terry, I recently compiled a report aimed at streamlining operations on a group of sites by eliminating the need for planners. Initially, our goal was not to take this approach, but we discovered that by tapping into the collective knowledge and experience of our workforce, we could find more cost-effective solutions. This was a unique situation, as I typically advocate for the vital role of planners in enhancing efficiency. However, as we delved deeper into the issue, it became evident that distributing responsibilities across the workforce instead of relying on a central role was the more strategic choice. Ultimately, in this specific scenario, decentralizing responsibilities proved to be the smarter approach overall.</p>

            <p>The recommended ratio of craftsmen to planners in maintenance audits within organizations is 25 craftsmen per 1 planner, with a variance of +-5. It is crucial for planners to possess practical experience in order to effectively plan work under the front-end loading concept, optimizing wrench time for craftsmen. Work planning can be categorized by discipline, such as mechanical (static & rotating equipment) and E&I tasks. The responsibilities of maintenance planners encompass daily planning, scheduling, and coordination across disciplines and departments, as well as updating maintenance master data like asset registers, equipment bills of materials, maintenance plans, and task lists. They also handle resource procurement for materials and external services, track maintenance KPIs, drive performance improvements, plan turnarounds and shutdowns, and collaborate on annual budgeting with various disciplines. Regrettably, specific data on the ratio of planners to craftsmen is unavailable as the practice of having main planners was established over a decade ago.</p>

            <p>An example of how we managed our pharmaceutical manufacturing plants is by dividing them into four sections. Each section is overseen by a Maintenance Planner who is responsible for planning and coordinating all maintenance jobs within their assigned area. Our Maintenance Engineering team consists of a diverse range of professionals including Maintenance Engineers, Stockroom Supervisors, Maintenance Systems Engineers, and craftmen such as mechanics, electricians, and instrumentation technicians. Additionally, Maintenance Planners are tasked with planning jobs for outside contractors, essentially creating another crew of technicians to support our operations.

To determine how to divide the plant into different areas, we analyzed the workload generated by production lines, utilities areas, and buildings, and grouped them together to ensure a balanced division. For instance, one planner was assigned to each complete plant, while the second plant was divided into three sections. One section was dedicated to a single manufacturing building, another oversaw two buildings with packaging, manufacturing, and office areas, and the last one managed a large utilities area, warehouse, and administrative office building. This strategic approach allows us to efficiently allocate resources and effectively maintain all areas of our facility.</p>

            <p>I fully agree with Darryl on the importance of sharing the workload when it comes to planning. Our team has always operated in this manner. Traditionally, our maintenance approach was focused on geographical areas. Most of the maintenance work, including preventive maintenance (PM), was conducted in the field on drilling rigs, heavy equipment, and oil wells. Our Maintenance Control Center in the oilfield is responsible for the Preventive Maintenance Program, issuing PM work orders to the appropriate Maintenance Responsibility Centers (MRCs). Because the MRCs are located near the equipment, they coordinate with Operations for equipment custody. Despite not having a central maintenance request point, our maintenance planners primarily consist of craft leaders.

Now, with the addition of a refinery, the potential for centralized maintenance exists. However, we continue to utilize the same method as in the oilfields, albeit with greater control from the MCC over the work order system. The owner still interacts with the MRCs, while the PM tasks are assigned and overseen by the MCC without a dedicated planner. This approach has proven effective for us, even though it may not align perfectly with traditional job descriptions for planners and supervisors. It's evident that many others are also recognizing the benefits of a more flexible approach, especially in today's environment where we are expected to achieve more with fewer resources and increased reliance on technology.

Recently, I have developed a Department Profile as part of an HR project, outlining roles and responsibilities. This document serves as the foundation for defining functions and job descriptions, encouraging a systemic approach rather than the traditional focus on individuals and functions.</p>

            <p>When it comes to planning and scheduling, it is important to separate the role from the individual tasked with these responsibilities. Planning involves defining the work, procedures, resources, materials, and logistics needed for a project, while scheduling focuses on determining the best timeline to minimize production losses. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, dedicated planners and schedulers may be necessary to ensure consistency and completeness. Delegating scheduling tasks to technicians can improve quality, especially when utilizing a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS). However, having clear guidelines and periodic audits are essential for successful delegation. One-time planning activities require continuous adjustments to adapt to changing dynamics, making a single-point accountability system the preferred solution. The lack of dedicated planners/schedulers in maintenance, particularly in Shutdown Maintenance, can result in low productivity and reliability compared to large construction projects. By instilling a focus on reliability and pride in work, technicians can improve overall performance and outcomes, similar to Toyota's success in rethinking production methods. Implementation of changes in maintenance practices requires careful consideration to achieve optimal results.</p>

            <p>Implementing a small-scale pilot project can effectively demonstrate the benefits of utilizing a planner in a maintenance setting. I witnessed a transformation at a site where planning had previously been minimal. A team of tradespeople and operators successfully planned a major gearcase rebuild using a word processor, without the aid of a CMMS. This task, which typically took 24 hours in the past, was completed in just 8 hours - a significant improvement. With over 10 gearcases needing attention, the potential for further efficiency gains was evident. Despite not quantifying the labor savings and reduced downtime, the success of the pilot project justified the need for a dedicated planner. The pressing question now was determining how many planners were required to sustain this level of efficiency.</p>

            <p>While I may not be an expert on the matter, it is important to consider that maintenance mechanics may lack the necessary communication skills to efficiently perform the job of a planner. Despite excelling in their roles as mechanics, it is possible that some individuals may struggle in a planning role due to communication issues. For example, out of a group of six mechanics with high school educations and completed millwright apprenticeships, at least one may not possess the communication skills required to be a reliable planner.

In such cases, it is essential to have a designated planner who can coordinate multiple jobs simultaneously and leverage their connections to ensure timely acquisition of parts, labor, and rental equipment. By centralizing communication with a planner, redundancies in requirements can be minimized, streamlining the process and saving time and resources. As Vee wisely noted, "this change requires careful consideration and implementation."</p>

            <p>In addition to trade-specific groups such as millwrights and Electrical/instrumentation mechanics, we also have various leadership roles within these groups, including foremen, supervisors, crewbosses, gangbosses, and leadmen. It is important to consider where these leaders fit into the overall structure. For example, the concept of having 15-20 craft per planner may raise concerns. In the military, small units are utilized for conducting duties and ensuring mission critical communications.</p>

            <p>In my view, it is crucial for a planner to have a deep understanding of the areas they are responsible for in their planning, especially within their own discipline. Whether they come from a junior or senior engineering background, the planner's experience and expertise will greatly impact the level of centralized and coordinated planning within the maintenance organization. A skilled planner should be proactive in creating a detailed work plan considering factors such as reliability, availability, efficiency, and lifecycle costs. This entails developing work sequences, scheduling, materials lists, QA/QC plans, HSE plans, and cost estimates through collaboration with various stakeholders. Differentiating planning from execution in the PDCA cycle is essential, as outlined in ISO9000 standards. Within each maintenance section, team leaders play a pivotal role in overseeing execution, ensuring compliance, quality control, and managing costs. It is important to recognize and promote employees based on their skills and competencies, allowing those with management and leadership abilities to excel in roles such as line trainers, planners, or senior inspectors.</p>

            <p>In order to effectively plan maintenance tasks, it is not necessary for planners to be experts in all areas, but they should have sufficient knowledge of the specific area they are working in, such as mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, or facilities. Planners must be able to analyze equipment owner requests and translate them into actionable steps for maintenance orders. They must also determine necessary materials, tools, and equipment rentals, as well as calculate the required crafts and resources. If a second Planner is not justified by the workload, the Planner should consult with the relevant supervisor or craft leader for expertise in areas where they may lack experience, such as electrical work. Over time, the Planner will gain confidence and experience in these areas. Additionally, the Planner can use the CMMS system to request the assistance of an electrician for planning complex electrical jobs.</p>

            <p>Terry, I have developed a system dynamics model that accurately assesses the impact of maintenance planners. By modeling various maintenance organizations of different sizes and effectiveness levels, the model has proven to be a reliable tool for evaluating current planning and scheduling efficiency and identifying areas for improvement. I used this model to advocate for a redesign of the planning and scheduling structure at my workplace, demonstrating that we could achieve significant improvements in wrench time by reducing the number of planners by 50%. The model also revealed potential gains in FTE numbers. It only takes about a day to model a maintenance crew or department with the right data. I have considered writing an article on this topic for you, as I believe it would be of interest to many.</p>

            <p>Setting up and running the model for organizational optimization is a straightforward process, easily understandable for managers, and provides valuable insights for practical applications. Developed using the "ithink" modeling software, the initial project highlighted the potential for significant time savings in the mechanical crew's operations. By improving the planning and scheduling system, it was projected that the average job time could be reduced by 3.2 hours, ultimately enhancing efficiency.

Furthermore, the model was instrumental in demonstrating the impact of different factors, such as the number of planners and performance levels, on work throughput and overall performance. It served as a powerful tool in aligning the management team's vision on the benefits of effective planning and scheduling, setting clear goals, and determining optimal staffing levels.

Additionally, the model revealed insightful differences between mechanical and electrical/instrument trades in terms of planning and scheduling effectiveness. By analyzing actual performance data, it became evident that the benefits of planning and scheduling were more substantial for mechanical trades. This underscores the importance of tailoring strategies to specific work processes for maximum efficiency.

With the capability to simulate scenarios for up to 100 maintenance personnel, the model has been utilized to establish implementation goals, determine staffing levels, and assess the potential impact of planning and scheduling efforts. It has also been valuable in training planners and maintenance coordinators, as well as studying the nuances between scheduling and planning strategies.

Overall, the model offers a comprehensive approach to optimizing operations over a two-year simulated period. Its versatility and practical applications make it a valuable tool for organizations seeking to streamline their processes and enhance overall efficiency.</p>

            <p>Josh, FTE stands for Full Time Equivalent, indicating the hours a maintenance worker typically works in a year, which is usually 2080 hours. Therefore, a 10 FTE improvement equates to a reduction of 20,800 hours annually. I possess a PowerPoint presentation elucidating the model's application in assessing the planning and scheduling efficiency of a maintenance team at a distinct plant site. Required data for the model include: backlog work orders, maintenance staff count, average overtime, emergency work percentage, weekly work orders created, and hours per work order. Additional subjective inputs encompass wrench time losses due to various factors and their frequency. By adjusting these inputs, the model can generate a range of outcomes. For instance, altering the average time for obtaining parts can indicate a reduction in work orders backlog and savings per work order. The model, requiring extensive calculations for each simulated week over a two-year period, demonstrates potential productivity gains through improved planning and scheduling. This tool has been utilized successfully in assessing and enhancing maintenance teams at various plant sites, leading to increased efficiency.</p>

            <p>In our organization, we have groups that are categorized by various trades such as millwrights, electrical/instrumentation mechanics, and general mechanics. These groups are led by individuals known as foremen, supervisors, crew bosses, gang bosses, leadmen, and more. But where do these leaders fit into the overall scheme of operations? This question seems to have been left unanswered. Within the framework of the "Maintenance Planners scheme," these leaders play a crucial role in leading their crew members in carrying out the planned and scheduled orders set by the Maintenance Planners. Additionally, they handle any unforeseen emergencies that may arise (as emergencies cannot be planned for). Moreover, they offer support to the Maintenance Planner whenever expertise is needed to plan certain types of jobs effectively.</p>

            <p>In our daily operations, we may not have designated planners, but during turnarounds, scheduled plant shutdowns, and major projects, our planning team plays a crucial role similar to that of traditional planners. Routine tasks like repairing a pump do not require the full planning process. With the introduction of CMMS, maintenance responsibilities are automatically assigned when a work order is inputted. This eliminates the need for a dedicated planner to review work requests, check material availability, track employee leave, and assign tasks to specific individuals such as Jim or Joe.</p>

            <p>In the world of equipment maintenance, routine tasks like repairing a pump leak may not always require extensive planning. Thanks to the introduction of CMMS, a work order for equipment automatically assigns responsibility to a maintenance center. This eliminates the need for a dedicated planner to review work requests, check for available materials, and delegate tasks. Some tasks, such as those that are straightforward and don't require parts, can easily be converted into orders and sent to the Maintenance Supervisor without much hesitation. However, more complex tasks may require the Maintenance Planner to inspect the equipment, interview relevant personnel, and possibly even consult with the manufacturer before creating detailed instructions. In my organization, the Maintenance Planner assigns tasks to the Maintenance Supervisor, who then decides which team member (Jim or Joe) will handle the job.</p>

            <p>quote: Josh mentioned that within each maintenance department (such as static, rotating, electrical, and instrument), there should be a designated team leader. This individual plays a crucial role in overseeing various aspects including progress tracking, ensuring schedule compliance, maintaining quality control, following procedures and instructions, adhering to specifications, codes, and standards, and ensuring compliance with statutory regulations. The team leader also serves as the main point of contact for expertise in their craft, provides on-site supervision and leadership, conducts troubleshooting and diagnostics, oversees HSE/PTW protocols, manages costs for projects under their supervision, provides training to their team, offers feedback to maintenance planning for improvement, ensures accurate data entry into the CMMS, and boosts morale, motivation, and evaluation within their team. This discussion aims to address the roles and responsibilities of lead craftsmen in comparison to planners. It is important to use the term "team leader" as a generic title for this position.
