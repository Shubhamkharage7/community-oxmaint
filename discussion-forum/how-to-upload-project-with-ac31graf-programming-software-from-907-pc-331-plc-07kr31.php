            <p>The ABB models that utilized 907 PC 331, such as the 07K31, were primarily programmed in a DOS-based environment. My experience with these devices on an Italian press was less than ideal. Unfortunately, ABB no longer provides information on their older Advant products, including the AC31 PLC. If you require the 907 PC 331 software, I could potentially assist you, although it may not be helpful for modifying a program on a 07K31 PLC. The software is cumbersome and not user-friendly, requiring the original code for access. 

Considering the level of ABB support in your region, particularly in Europe or the Middle East, it may be worth exploring options for assistance. While ABB's AC drives are well-supported, there may be limitations with PLC support. If support is unavailable, it may be necessary to replace the ABB PLC and start fresh. This decision, although tough, will ensure that you have a supported PLC in the long term. 

I possess the 907 PC 331 software if you have a DOS-based PC and are interested in trying it out. Additionally, ABB produced multiple PLCs under the Advant name, including the AC31 or CS31 models. It is possible that the AC31GRAF was intended for newer controllers than the 07K31, but further clarification may be needed.</p>

            <p>In 2003, loolrsdoran stated that ABB models such as the 07K31, which utilized the 907 PC 331, were exclusively dos-based devices. These devices were not user-friendly and were difficult to work with. The ABB website no longer provides information on older Advant items, including the AC31. If you need the 907 PC 331 software, I may be able to assist you, but it may not be useful for downloading programs from a 07K31 PLC for modification. The software is cumbersome and not conducive to online editing.

If you do not have the original file for the PLC, this software will not be helpful. It requires the original code to access the PLC, and it does not support online editing. Depending on the quality of ABB support in your region, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, it may be beneficial to seek assistance there. It is important to determine if PLC support is available in your area. If support is unavailable, it may be necessary to consider investing in a different PLC system that is fully supported.

ABB also produced several PLCs under the Advent name, including the AC31 or CS31 models. The AC31GRAF may have been intended for newer model controllers rather than the 07K31. If you are searching for a 907 PC 331 download, feel free to reach out for assistance.</p>

            <p>In response to a query about ABB PLC software, rsdoran explained that the models utilizing 907 PC 331, such as the 07K31, were programmed in DOS. Having dealt with these on an Italian press, rsdoran expressed a strong dislike for them. The ABB website no longer provides information on older Advant items, including the AC31. Despite possessing the 907 PC 331 software, rsdoran warned that it would not facilitate downloading or modifying programs on a 07K31 PLC. Furthermore, rsdoran emphasized the software's clumsiness and difficulty. For those without the original PLC file, access is restricted without the original code, as it is DOS-based and lacks online editing capabilities.

In terms of support, rsdoran recommended considering the superior ABB support in the Euro/Middle East regions compared to the US. While AC drives are well-supported, there may be issues with PLC support. If support is lacking, rsdoran advised abandoning the ABB PLC and starting fresh to ensure a supported system and improve familiarity with the software and equipment. Additionally, rsdoran offered the 907 PC 331 software for those with a DOS-based PC interested in trying it.

It was noted that ABB produced multiple PLCs under the Advant name, with designations such as AC31 or CS31. Though uncertain about the AC31GRAF, rsdoran speculated that it may have been intended for newer model controllers than the 07K31.</p>
