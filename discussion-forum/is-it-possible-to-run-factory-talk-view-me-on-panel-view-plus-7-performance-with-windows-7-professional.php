                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am looking to execute a Factory Talk View ME project on a Panel View Plus 7 Performance HMI. The project was created on a 'Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Operating System'. Is this feasible? According to the HMI user manual, the supported Microsoft® Windows® operating systems are as follows:
- Series A (and Stainless Steel Series A and B): Windows CE 6.0
- Series B (and Stainless Steel Series C): Windows 10 IoT Core

Can the Factory Talk View ME project run on a Panel View Plus 7 Performance HMI with a 'Windows 7 Professional 64 bit Operating System'? The HMI user manual lists the compatible Microsoft® Windows® operating systems for different series, such as Windows CE 6.0 for Series A and Windows 10 IoT Core for Series B.</p>

            <p>Typically, a MER file should function properly on a PanelView Plus (PV+) if it was compiled for the appropriate HMI type (compact, standard, performance, etc.) and the HMI firmware version is equal to or higher than the compiled file. The operating system of the development computer is usually not a factor. While it is possible for issues to arise, in my experience, it is not a common occurrence. Ensuring the MER file matches the target device is key. The details provided in the manual seem to pertain to the operating system running within the HMI itself.</p>

            <p>You can run FTME version on your PC and create the .mer file regardless of the operating system you are using. Personally, I prefer to use a Windows 7 virtual machine for FTME versions 8 to 12.</p>

            <p>According to robertmee, the operating system doesn't matter as long as you can run the FTME version on your PC and create the .mer file. Personally, I utilize a Windows 7 virtual machine for FTME versions 8 to 12. However, to have multiple versions of FTME, it is essential to have a separate virtual machine for each version. This principle likely applies to FTSE as well.</p>

            <p>FearTheNoFear inquired about the necessity of having individual virtual machines for each version of FTME and FTSE. While it is possible to have FTME and FTSE (FactoryTalk View) coexist, it is recommended to have separate VMs for each version.</p>
