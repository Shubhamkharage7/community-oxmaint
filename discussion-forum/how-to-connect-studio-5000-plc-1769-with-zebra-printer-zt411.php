            <p>Was the Network Connect firmware option purchased or loaded onto your Zebra printer? If not, you can find more information on how to obtain the firmware here: https://supportcommunity.zebra.com/s/article/Network-Connect-firmware-for-Link-OS-Printers?language=en_US. The part number for the firmware is CAG-P1096531. In a previous integration project, the Zebra printer was bought without the firmware preloaded. The customer had to make a separate purchase and we had to manually install it in order to enable Ethernet/IP connectivity.</p>

            <p>L33er suggested considering an alternative approach by utilizing socket communication. Hi L33er, could you provide guidance on implementing Socket Communication? While I am familiar with using TCP-IP on Siemens PLC, I am new to applying it with AB. Any chance you could share a sample program or code for connecting a Zebra Printer using socket communication? In my previous experience with Zebra Printers, the connection was Open-Loop, allowing only for sending Configuration and Data Files for printing without receiving any confirmation. I am unsure if the same condition applies for PLC Siemens in this case.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, RahmanMarjono here. I wanted to address an issue with the ZT411 Zebra Printer where the IP address is already the same as the PLC. It is crucial in an IP network to ensure that no two devices share the same IP address. To resolve this, you will need to assign a unique IP address to the printer within the same subnet. One solution is to establish a TCP connection or socket in your PLC program using the printer's IP address. By sending ASCII printing commands through this connection, you can avoid the need for any extra modules in the PLC system. This method allows for efficient printing functionality without compromising the network's integrity.</p>

            <p>Incorporating a link-OS module into the PLC and assigning it the same IP address as the printer can lead to complications in the control process. To avoid any issues, it is advisable to use different IP addresses for the PLC and printer. Additionally, the EIP firmware may not be compatible with the ZT411 printer model.</p>
