                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As a novice in Rockwell software, I have received some basic training but lack advanced knowledge. At my company, we rely on Reliable products for HVAC programming. Our current challenge involves programming a Make-up Air Unit to activate based on commands from an HMI interface. For instance, an operator may choose to start the MAU between 9 am and 2 pm on one day but restrict it to 8 am to 10 am on another day. While I am familiar with using WallClockTime, I am unsure of how to compare DINT tags from the HMI with GSV values. I have attached a sketch of the HMI for reference. Explore more about this topic at Imgur, where you can find a variety of entertaining content ranging from funny jokes to viral videos.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, Duchx2 expressed uncertainty about comparing DINT tags from the HMI with GSV values. The Rockwell Automation website offers a set of routines for handling 64-bit WallClockTime values in Logix programming. It is crucial to align the time representations from both systems by ensuring they share the same zero epoch, time zone, and interval per count. The HMI's DINT value likely indicates a 32-bit count of whole seconds since the Unixâ„¢ epoch, while the Logix GSV WallClockTime object represents a 64-bit count of microseconds since the same epoch. To prevent rollover issues and ensure accurate comparisons, moving the values to LREALs with 53 bits of precision could be a practical solution. Considerations such as drift, clock synchronization, and required accuracy should also be taken into account for a successful comparison process.</p>

            <p>Converting the HMI DINT into a readable date and time format, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second, allows for comparison with the GSV WALLCLOCKTIME.DateTime DINT[7] from Logix. However, this comparison can be complicated and difficult to manage.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I find the concept of utilizing DINT tags in Logix Designer rather complex for my level of expertise. My plan was to create a DINT tag named "Monday" with sub-divisions such as Monday.8 for 8am, Monday.9 for 9am, and so forth. By assigning values to these subdivisions, such as 1792 for the time period from 8am to 10am, I can then compare it to the WallClockTime. As someone who is self-taught, I will begin by delving into the suggestions you have provided.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I was initially confused about the application. Are you suggesting having 7 DINTs, one for each day of the week, with the first 24 bits of each DINT representing hours of the day? Essentially, the PLC would only need to identify the current day of the week to determine which DINT to reference and which bit to check for the current hour using DINT[3] from the WallClockTime/LocalDateTime GSV. It's actually a clever approach. Instead of converting the day of the week and hour operator input into a seconds-since-epoch DINT value on the HMI side, focusing on the day of the week could streamline the process. You can search this forum or the Rockwell site for "day of week" to find a suitable AOI. Alternatively, by knowing that the 1970-Jan-01 epoch fell on a Thursday, you could divide the GSV WallClockTime/CurrentValue by 86,4000,000,000 (Âµs/d; truncated) to calculate days since the epoch, then determine the day of the week offset from Thursday (0=Thursday, 2=Friday, ..., 6=Wednesday) or adjust it by 4 initially to find the offset from Sunday:

Code:
GSV WALLCLOCKTIME CurrentValue wallclock_LINT
### Obtain CurrentValue of WALLCLOCKTIME, Âµs since epoch
MOD wallclock_LINT 86400000000 working_LINT
### Determine current day in Âµs
SUB wallclock_LINT working_LINT working_LINT
### Truncate CurrentValue to start of today
DIV working_LINT 86400000000 working_LINT
### Calculate today's offset from epoch in days
ADD working_LINT 4 working_LINT
### Determine today's offset from Sunday Dec. 28, 1969 in days
MOD working_LINT 7 working_LINT
### Find day of the week, offset from Sunday, in days</p>

            <p>Now that I have successfully programmed my PLC to display the day of the week, I can easily compare the chosen day on my HMI interface. The next step is to implement time-based controls for my machine, such as operating from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., with flexibility for adjustments based on production demands. Despite searching extensively on online forums, I have yet to find a solution for setting working hours. Any assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated as it is the final hurdle in completing my project. Thank you for your help in advance.</p>
