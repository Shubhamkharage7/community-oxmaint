            <p>What is the percentage above 110%? Is the pump designed to operate slightly beyond 110% of its rated flow capacity?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When a pump is operated beyond its rated capacity, at around 130-135%, several effects may occur. Increased vibration, NPSHR, power requirements, and radial loading are expected outcomes. It is important to note that pumps are not designed for operation at 110% of their rated capacity. The rated capacity typically accounts for about 110% of normal operating conditions. 

Can you help me understand the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) of the efficiency curve attached? The efficiency curve appears to increase beyond the BEP. The pump is currently operating at 132 GPM and 570 FT.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Operating a pump at higher revolutions per minute can lead to quicker wear and tear. It is important to ensure that the manufacturer has tested the pump and approved its safe operation at those RPMs. Is this pump possibly a centrifugal pump designed for water? Looking at the graph, it seems that the pump's Best Efficiency Point (BEP) is not clearly indicated. Finding the BEP can only be achieved through testing, as the efficiency will decrease before reaching this point. It is crucial to understand where the BEP is located for optimal pump performance.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. What are the consequences of running a pump beyond its rated speed of 110% on a continuous basis?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Running a pump beyond its rated speed can lead to increased wear and tear on the pump components, reduced efficiency, higher energy consumption, and potential mechanical failures. It is important to operate pumps within their designed specifications to ensure optimal performance and longevity.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. Can you provide insights on the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) indicated in the performance curve attached?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The Best Efficiency Point (BEP) on a pump performance curve represents the operating point at which the pump achieves its highest efficiency. Operating the pump close to the BEP helps minimize energy consumption and prolong the pump's lifespan. Deviating significantly from the BEP can result in decreased efficiency, higher energy costs, and potential issues with pump reliability.</p>
