                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, PVP 7 is experiencing some performance issues after running smoothly since its last modification in 2023. Occasionally, the system slows down or becomes unresponsive. When functioning properly, all buttons respond promptly and screens switch quickly. However, during the times when it is not working correctly, the mouse cursor may not align perfectly with finger presses, causing buttons to not respond. A unique feature of this system is that the clock on the screens never misses a beat. Occasionally, a reboot can resolve the issue. Interestingly, Terminal settings pages show perfect response times. Monitoring memory usage reveals MERuntime RAM at 15936KB, Total RAM usage at 63800KB, and Available RAM at 375864KB. Please share any suggestions or advice if you have encountered similar issues.</p>

            <p>Are there any visual abnormalities in the video, such as color bands or dead pixels? If the buttons are unresponsive, do they start working after a few minutes or do you need to reboot the system? I experienced a similar issue with a 2021 PV+7 model, where video artifacts would appear and the terminal would freeze until a power cycle was done. However, I did not conduct further diagnostics at that time. Interestingly, the same application ran smoothly on a new PV+ model. Make sure to inspect the FactoryTalk View Diagnostics by creating a display with only the FT Diagnostics window to check for any communication syntax or connection issues. It is worth noting that despite the system clock functioning properly, indicating the operating system is functioning, the problem may lie within a component of FTView.</p>

            <p>Hello Ken, appreciate the prompt response. The display is free of visual artifacts and dead pixels. However, there seems to be an issue with unresponsive buttons. A power cycle is necessary to restore functionality, but sometimes the response is slow even after that. I have not been able to observe if updates are still occurring on pages showing live values from the PLC. Tomorrow, I will attempt to use a different laptop to access the FT Diagnostics window and monitor the situation for any anomalies.</p>

            <p>When asked for VBA scripts, ActiveX controls, or animations, lmscar12 suspected a memory leak. However, there are no scripts or activeX controls involved. The program includes simple color animations based on states with no fancy gradients. Despite remaining unchanged for nearly two years, the issue of memory leakage has only recently surfaced within the last three weeks, according to the operators.</p>
