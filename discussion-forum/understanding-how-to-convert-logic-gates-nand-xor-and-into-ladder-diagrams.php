            <p>In ladder logic programming, it is common for logic gates to be associated with specific instructions. The complexities of ladder logic lie in the varying platforms that may or may not allow for linking gates like an electronic schematic. What PLC platform are you using to implement this logic? Providing this information can streamline the help you receive from others. It is essential to understand how different PLC platforms may affect your ladder logic programming.</p>

            <p>In the diagram provided by Parky, there is a starter example that demonstrates the concept of open contacts in series for AND logic, represented as ----|  |----, as opposed to NOT logic, shown as ----|/|--- with a bar. Additionally, OR logic is depicted by open contacts in parallel. I appreciate the clarification.

Regarding the inputs (M0, M1, M2) and the output (M3) in the diagram, why are there three inputs present in this scenario? Does this correlate specifically to incorporating AND, NAND, or XOR logic in the ladder diagram? Can you confirm which configuration corresponds to AND, XOR, and NAND, based on the diagram provided?

            <p>Cardosocea highlighted that logic gates usually correspond to specific instructions in ladder programming. However, it can be challenging to link gates in some PLC platforms compared to others. Which PLC platform are you using to implement and translate your logic? Knowing this will allow others to offer more targeted assistance. I am currently utilizing TIA Portal for my logic diagram.

            <p>TIA features IEC blocks that function as logic gates, a modern approach to programming PLCs. While ladder logic is still widely used, function block diagrams are gaining popularity. The IEC FBD allows for easy expansion of inputs by adjusting the block size, simplifying the creation of complex logic functions. Additionally, the FBD allows for the inversion of inputs by simply clicking on the connection and setting it to a NOT operation. Different PLC manufacturers may use slightly varied symbols or text, like Siemens using "&" instead of "AND" by Mitsubishi. Understanding these differences is key in effectively working with PLCs. In the US, logic symbols differ from those in Europe, as do PLC instructions and terminology, like the concept of "AOI" being similar to a function block in Europe.</p>

            <p>In his response, Karl Smith expressed gratitude and mentioned his use of TIA Portal to implement his logic diagram. He emphasized the importance of understanding logic gates to enhance comprehension of ladder diagrams. This foundational knowledge aids in effectively translating logic into the desired ladder diagram.

Learning a new language based on existing skills is commendable. While there may not be a direct correspondence between logic gates and ladder logic concepts, it presents an excellent learning opportunity. To effectively write ladder logic, two key factors must be grasped: the scan cycle and the available library of functions.

The library of operations in Boolean logic consists of three atomic operations: AND, OR, and NOT. Ladder logic includes these three fundamental operations, with other non-atomic operations like NAND, XOR, and NOR being combinations of the atomic operations. While some PLC brands may include additional non-atomic operations, ladder logic typically requires constructing them from the atomic operations and connections between them.

In ladder logic, the atomic operations of Boolean logic are implemented using Normally Open (NO) and Normally Closed (NC) contact symbols. For example, the NOT operation is implemented via the NC contact. Inverting compound logic in ladder logic involves utilizing the NOT contact symbols and applying DeMorgan's Laws.

AND operations are represented by contacts connected in series on a single branch, while OR operations are depicted by contacts connected in parallel on multiple branches. Understanding the scan cycle and the discrete nature of ladder logic evaluation is crucial, as it differs from the continuous nature of logic gates. Ladder logic is evaluated discreetly in a specific order per scan cycle, emphasizing the importance of timing in PLC programming.

Overall, the distinction between ladder logic and logic gates lies in the discrete evaluation process of ladder logic compared to the continuous nature of logic gates. This difference highlights the significance of timing in ladder logic programming, where when an action occurs holds more weight than what the action is. Mastering these concepts is essential for proficient implementation of ladder logic programs.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Understanding the importance of time in ladder logic is crucial. One of the most commonly used patterns in ladder logic is the canonical Start/Stop Circuit. The tags Start, Stop, and Run all refer to specific bits in memory. The superscript Â° added to the Run tag is not standard ladder logic but a temporary convention used here to represent the same memory bit as the Run in the coil on the right.

When evaluating this ladder logic rung, the Start contact is checked first, followed by the Run contact. The result of these evaluations is then combined at the closing branch. Finally, the Stop contact is evaluated, and the Run coil is activated based on the previous evaluations. This sequence emphasizes the importance of the timing of when values are read and written in ladder logic instructions.

The key takeaway here is that the value of Run examined by the Run contact instruction during a scan cycle was actually written during the previous scan cycle. This distinction highlights the different timings at play within the same memory bit, showcasing the intricacies of ladder logic programming.</p>
