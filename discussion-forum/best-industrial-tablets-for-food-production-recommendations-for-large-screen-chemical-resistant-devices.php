                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone,I am in search of recommendations for large industrial tablets for a specific application. These tablets will be used for data entry in QA processes and need to have a screen large enough to display A4 size forms. They will be used in a food production environment, so they must be able to withstand exposure to chemicals and steam, even though they will not be deliberately subjected to it. The tablets should be able to endure being placed on a table and potentially sprayed with a hose by a thorough cleaner. They are preferably Windows-based, but Android could also be considered. Additionally, they should have a long-lasting battery as they will be used intermittently throughout the day and charged overnight. Have any of you had experiences, whether successful or disastrous, with similar industrial tablets?</p>

            <p>When it comes to durability and reliability, the Panasonic Toughbooks reign supreme. These rugged devices are built to withstand tough conditions and feature hot-swappable batteries. However, they are not known for being budget-friendly, lightweight, or slim in design.

For a more innovative solution, consider the rack charging station offered by Captec. This convenient station allows for efficient charging and storage of tablets, such as iPads, Toughbooks, and Surfaces. It's important to have a designated place to securely store and charge your devices at the end of each shift, while also being able to easily identify any missing items.

If you're interested in exploring alternative options, XCIEL offers a unique product that integrates with regular iPads or Surfaces. While their claims may be intriguing, it's crucial to inquire about their testing and certification procedures, especially as their electronics may not meet industry standards such as C1D2, ATEX Zone2, and IECEx. Be sure to discuss any potential exclusions they may have for these certifications before making a decision.</p>

            <p>Consider using iPads in "industrial cases" instead - this can offer significant cost savings. Utilize MDM solutions like Cisco Meraki to secure the iPads and restrict access. Even if a few iPads break occasionally, the cost is still lower compared to a single "industrial tablet" running Windows. iPads also offer better battery life and performance. Make sure you have a wireless infrastructure set up for connectivity.</p>

            <p>xC0MMAND0x suggested using iPads with durable "industrial cases" as a cost-effective alternative for industrial tablets. By implementing MDM solutions like Cisco Meraki, you can control and restrict access to specific applications.

Despite occasional breakage, iPads still prove to be a more economical choice compared to "industrial tablets" running Windows. Additionally, iPads offer superior battery life and performance. It is assumed that a wireless infrastructure is already in place. Following the same approach, we also utilize iPads with defender cases and integrate Thin Manager to optimize compatibility with our mobile platform.</p>

When considering devices like iPads, Toughbooks, or Surfaces for field staff use, the challenge lies in safely storing, charging, and keeping track of them. XCIEL offers an intriguing option for industrial tablets, although the claims they make may not align with the actual certifications of the electronics inside.

For those interested in using Android tablets with Reachview 3, recommendations are welcomed. Transitioning to tablets for field staff can offer a larger screen and longer battery life compared to smartphones. If you have experience with rugged Android tablets, your insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for any suggestions!</p>
