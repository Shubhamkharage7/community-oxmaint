                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings! Currently, I am setting up a PowerFlex 753 drive that is linked to a PLC Micro 850 using Ethernet IP. I have successfully managed to oversee the operation command and frequency from the PLC. However, I am facing an issue where the drive needs to retain the frequency and command status if communication is lost between the PLC and the drive. After consulting the 20-750-ENETR manual, I attempted to adjust parameter P33 to a value of 3 as suggested. Unfortunately, this modification did not yield the desired results. Do you have any insights or suggestions on additional steps I may need to take?</p>

            <p>It is crucial for the customer to have a way to safely halt the drive to avoid potential legal issues. Make sure to also set Idle Fault to 3 in any case.</p>

            <p>In a recent discussion, robertmee expressed concerns about the need for customers to have an external means of stopping drives to avoid potential lawsuits. It's important to note that simply assuming a stopped state is safe may not always be accurate, especially in industries like cooling water pumps, reactor agitators, and offshore drilling pumps. While a hardwired stopping method is essential, some sectors prioritize keeping equipment running until destruction to protect lives and the environment.</p>

            <p>In certain scenarios, the safest option may be to keep equipment running, such as cooling water pumps, reactor agitators, and some offshore drilling pumps. However, it is crucial to have a secondary stopping method in place in case the primary control is lost. While some industries prioritize keeping equipment operational to prevent safety risks, it is essential to always have a backup plan for emergencies.</p>
