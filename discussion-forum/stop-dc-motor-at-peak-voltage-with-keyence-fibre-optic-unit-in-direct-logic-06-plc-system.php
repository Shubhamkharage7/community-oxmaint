                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently facing a unique challenge while working with a customer's Direct Logic 06 PLC system. The customer's setup includes a DC motor running at 10 RPM, connected to a shaft with a notch. A Keyence fibre optic unit is positioned to detect when light passes through the notch as the shaft rotates. The Keyence unit outputs an analog signal based on the amount of light passing through the notch. The goal is to stop the motor when the Keyence unit reaches its peak voltage output.

The customer prefers to use the "peak" voltage rather than a preset number, as external factors such as light values or dirt may cause variations in the set value. Therefore, the motor should be stopped when the Keyence unit reaches the highest voltage for that specific rotation. Your assistance in solving this challenge would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Bill.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The concept of "peak voltage" refers to a specific time period during which multiple voltage samples are taken across various motor positions. The ultimate peak voltage value cannot be determined until the final sample is collected. If the final sample does not represent the peak voltage, it indicates that the motor has surpassed the peak voltage position and needs to rotate in the opposite direction. But is the motor capable of doing so? How are motor positions managed and what role does inertia play in this process? Additionally, noise interference can make this task more challenging. Perhaps it is feasible to outline a strategy for approaching peak voltage and forecasting the next peak voltage position, but having control over the motor position in both directions would likely offer more advantages.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  How can I use a Keyence fibre optic unit in a Direct Logic 06 PLC system to stop a DC motor at peak voltage?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> To stop the DC motor at peak voltage detected by the Keyence fibre optic unit, you can program the PLC to monitor the analog signal output by the Keyence unit and stop the motor once the signal reaches its highest voltage for that specific rotation.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Why is it important to stop the DC motor at the peak voltage detected by the Keyence unit instead of using a preset number?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Stopping the motor at the peak voltage detected by the Keyence unit allows for greater precision and adaptability in response to external factors like varying light values or dirt that may affect the signal output. This approach ensures that the motor is stopped at the optimal point for each rotation.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  How can I account for variations in the peak voltage due to external factors like light values or dirt when setting up the system?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> By monitoring the analog signal output by the Keyence fibre optic unit in real-time and dynamically adjusting the stopping point based on the peak voltage detected for each rotation, you can account for variations caused by external factors and ensure accurate motor control.</p>
