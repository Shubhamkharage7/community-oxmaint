                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Using TIA Portal v16 Upd6, I have set up a project with an S7-1200 (6ES7214-1AG40-0XB0) PLC and WinCC Unified (PC station). Initially, communication between the runtime and PLC was flawless when connected directly via Ethernet cable. However, upon relocating the PLC to a distant spot, connectivity issues arose. Despite both devices being on the same subnet, the runtime displayed an exclamation mark on IO fields, indicating a lack of connection to the PLC.

An intriguing workaround was discovered: reconnecting the PLC directly to the PC temporarily resolved the issue. Subsequently, reconnecting them via the network also restored proper functionality. This cycle had to be repeated each time the PC's IP address changed or upon a reboot. It is puzzling why this process is necessary and how to establish consistent communication without the initial direct connection step. Both Ethernet ports are within the same subnet, with correct TCPIP settings on the PG/PC interface. What could be causing this intermittent connectivity problem, and how can it be resolved for seamless operation without the need for repetitive direct connections?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Update: The issue has been identified and resolved. The PG/PC interface was originally configured as "TCPIP.Auto.1", but changing it to "TCPIP.1" has resolved the issue and everything is now functioning correctly.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>TCPIP.Auto automatically assigns an IP address within the same subnet as the device it is communicating with. This feature proves to be extremely beneficial when connecting to multiple PLCs, as it eliminates the need to manually change your IP address for each one. However, while this function streamlines the process, it also restricts the ability to implement Routing/NAT and can cause headaches for IT departments.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>14-11-2024</span></li>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Indeed, it is advisable to steer clear of using the '.auto' option for setting up TCPIP. When using TCPIP.Auto, the IP address is automatically assigned within the same subnet as the device it is communicating with. However, this can cause issues with Routing/NAT and lead to headaches for IT departments. It seems that opting for the .auto option may result in additional complexities. As suggested by aamirawan91, having ports in the same subnet eliminates the need for routing. This has been a common occurrence, especially among colleagues new to TIA, who select the .auto option without realizing the complications it may cause in getting online.</p>
