            <p>Hello Shukri, there are various indicators and key performance metrics that can be linked to the work of these professionals. The choice of indicators depends on what you aim to evaluate. To gauge their overall effectiveness, you could consider measuring unit costs post-project completion. Alternatively, you could align each project with specific outcomes. These outcomes may not be solely performance-based, but could also involve improvements in areas like risk management or environmental practices over time. The key question to ask is: what do you want to assess these professionals for? What goals should they be accomplishing based on your company's objectives? And how can these achievements be measured? I recently published a book on this very topic, now available on Amazon.com. Titled "The Maintenance Scorecard" with ISBN: 0831131810, the book offers a range of insights on creating indicators for targeted enhancements. For more information, you can find the book at this link: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0831131810. Best regards, Daryl Mather www.strategic-advantages.com</p>

            <p>If reliability engineers are involved in RCM, it may be worth considering the adoption and adaptation of the RCM scorecard. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to preparation and discussion in this area, suggesting potential for expansion to encompass additional reliability activities.</p>

            <p>Hi Josh, have you had a chance to review the comments regarding human error? Your input would be valuable in our ongoing efforts. The RCM Scorecard, featured in the book "The Maintenance Scorecard", is the culmination of years of research and development dating back to 2002. It plays a crucial role in the asset management information portfolio of several companies, offering a unique approach to measuring success without overwhelming users with excessive indicators. This innovative method differs significantly from traditional reliabilityweb practices, drawing on advanced asset management strategies and rationale for implementation. I am currently preparing a white paper on this subject for potential publication on reliabilityweb. I have included an overview table for your reference, showcasing the end product of our work. Your feedback and insights are greatly appreciated. Best regards, Daryl Mather

            <p>Hello Daryl, 
In many organizations, reliability engineers play a crucial role in facilitating various activities such as Root Cause Failure Analysis (RCFA), Bad Actor Accelerations, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), Risk-Based Inspection (RBI), Safety Integrity Level (SIL) Studies, as well as conducting risk assessments and reviewing reliability block diagrams and maintainability requirements. They serve as the custodians of these tools and collaborate with maintenance, operations, and project engineers to ensure that equipment is designed with reliability as a top priority. They also ensure that all necessary reliability plans are in place during operation and are responsible for identifying the root causes of failures. Additionally, they are accountable for implementing systems to manage non-conformances, eliminate defects, and address bad actor issues. Given the diverse range of their responsibilities, what key performance indicators (KPIs) should be used to measure their effectiveness?</p>

            <p>Dear Shukri,

Thank you for your post. Your comments resonate with my previous statements. It is essential to identify a variety of indicators and key performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of professionals in this field. Ultimately, it is crucial to determine what your company specifically expects from these professionals, rather than focusing on what reliability engineers typically do in various companies.

One way to measure their performance could be by implementing performance measures such as the Analysis rate for RCM and the level of tolerable risk managed for RBI. These metrics can partially assess the work of the reliability engineer and the implementation process they follow. However, it is challenging to hold people accountable for delivering results rather than just generating ideas.

It is important to develop an indicator system based on the objectives and benefits of each method and how the reliability engineer's activities contribute to those objectives. It is crucial to address the core question of "why are we doing this in the first place?" Strategic initiatives, activities, and methods must align with corporate objectives and goals to be effective in the long term.

To determine the performance indicators and improvement plan for reliability engineers in your plant, consider the following steps:
1. Align with corporate objectives supporting their activities.
2. Represent these objectives at the worker level (reliability engineers).
3. Take actions to achieve corporate goals based on the current situation, with additional indicators to track progress.

By following this approach, you can assess whether the current activities align with the goals, if the analytical roles are appropriate, and establish specific performance indicators that directly link personal performance to corporate requirements.

I understand if this is not the response you were expecting, but I urge you to consider this approach for developing a successful indicator regime for reliability engineers.

Warm regards,
Daryl Mather
