            <p>Hello Mike, 
In numerous countries, lawmakers are shifting away from rigid regulations, like the ones you mentioned. Instead, they are focusing on logical and practical approaches to achieve equal or superior risk reduction. Ultimately, it comes down to balancing compliance costs with investment in building a strong case. It would be valuable to assess the financial impact on your business. Can you provide us with some cost estimates?</p>

            <p>In the past, I conducted Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) analysis on medical equipment, focusing on specific environmental and operational criteria. The results often differed from the recommended maintenance guidelines. However, after demonstrating to the FDA that the proposed tasks effectively addressed critical issues, we were able to obtain approval to adjust our maintenance program in certain areas. I also have recent experience in the bio-tech industry, which presented similar challenges. In this case, we decided not to make changes to procedures due to the high cost involved. Regulatory bodies, especially in industries like pharmaceuticals, are typically resistant to changes that come with significant costs. In my experience, compliance often requires a financial investment. If you want to comply, be prepared to invest. - Ken Culverson</p>

            <p>Our website has recently implemented a Pressure Safety Device program that was overlooked during the plant start-up process. Many areas have specific testing requirements for such devices, so it would be wise to create a worksheet outlining these minimum testing requirements. Organizing the testing schedules for the safety devices may reveal that they are staggered, making it easier to plan for testing. In the case of pressure safety devices, we have opted to replace the unit and send it to a certified shop for testing. In our region, certification by a reputable shop is mandatory. Once the units are back at our facility, they are stored in our Spares inventory. This streamlined process has saved us time and effort in the long run.</p>

            <p>In my experience, it is not uncommon to find maintenance or testing frequencies in code or regulatory documents phrased as "recommendations" rather than "requirements." This allows for some flexibility for users to utilize technical analyses like RCM to deviate from the suggested schedule. If needed, you can also explore the option of requesting an exception or exemption from the regulatory body. 

In the realm of fire protection, a notable RCM study was carried out by the Department of Defense back in 1999 focusing on inspection, testing, and maintenance tasks for fire protection systems in facilities. The findings of this study led to the creation of a Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) document, now serving as the standard in DOD facilities and taking precedence over NFPA 25 and 72. The frequency of tasks outlined in the RCM-based UFC is generally lower compared to NFPA guidelines. 

Rumor has it that the upcoming release of NFPA 25 is expected to align more closely with RCM principles, adopting a more performance-based and less prescriptive approach. Are there any further insights on this topic? - Shelley</p>

            <p>Thank you to all for your valuable comments and suggestions. Allow me to provide some clarity about our state-of-the-art facility situated offshore Nigeria. This facility is a newly constructed FPSO (Floating Production Storage Offloading) designed for efficient oil production. Upon deployment, the anticipated production rates include 250,000 barrels per day, storage capacity of 2.1 million barrels, gas reinjection of 450 million standard cubic feet per day, and seawater injection of 450,000 barrels per day. The staff at the facility is expected to consist of around 100 individuals, with approximately 36 dedicated to maintenance tasks.

The challenge we face lies in the maintenance staff count, as the current levels are inadequate to manage the testing of over 8,000 safety devices on a scheduled basis. To address this issue, we are considering transitioning to a Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) approach for the maintenance and testing of these safety devices. In terms of Pressure Safety Valves (PSVs), our plan is to conduct random inspections and testing every 5 years, as suggested by Wally.

Our primary focus is on ensuring the reliability and functionality of Fire & Gas devices, gas detectors, thermal/heat devices, fire fighting equipment, among others, due to the extensive list of safety-related devices at the facility. We are exploring the possibility of seeking an exception to current regulations, but to do so effectively, we need to provide examples where regulatory bodies have allowed deviations and flexibility.

Once again, I appreciate the insightful comments and feedback. Regards, Mike.</p>

            <p>Prescriptive testing requirements are being phased out in many countries, particularly in Western Europe and other regions. While Nigeria still adheres to prescriptive legislation, some Operators in the Oil & Gas industry have been able to secure exemptions by demonstrating the validity of their case. 

The connection between Reliability, Technical Integrity, and Safety/Environmental performance is crucial. Test frequencies and failure rates play a key role in determining component availability, while the configuration of components and voting systems impact Safety System Availability. For more in-depth information on these topics, please refer to Chapters 3, 9, and 10 of my book.

Using IPF (based on IEC 61508) ensures the integrity of instrument protective systems like Fire & Gas, ESD, and EDP. IPF helps establish the necessary redundancy levels during the design phase and identifies the required test frequency. RBI (based on API 580) is utilized to determine inspection frequencies for static equipment such as pressure vessels and pipelines. RCM (in compliance with SAE 1011/1012) is employed to ascertain test frequencies for potential hidden failures in systems containing rotating machinery.

A common challenge from regulators revolves around the accuracy of failure rate information and our assumptions regarding 'tolerable risk levels'. While the former necessitates concrete data, the latter requires a deep understanding. Overcoming this challenge can be difficult, especially if regulators are risk-averse, uninformed, or lack decision-making authority.

Trying to argue with regulators that risk reduction efforts are too demanding or costly is unlikely to succeed. Demonstrating how our chosen approach can effectively reduce risk is more likely to be persuasive. Implementing the risk reduction processes outlined earlier can also lead to decreased effort, downtime, and costs, eliminating the need to dwell on these topics with regulators and focusing solely on risk mitigation strategies.</p>

            <p>While many people primarily associate RCM with the SAE standard, it's important to note that there is also an IEC RCM standard. Have you ever wondered about the distinctions between these two standards? The IEC 60300-3-11 (1999-03) standard, titled "Dependability Management-Part 3-11: Application Guide-Reliability Centered Maintenance," outlines the process of creating a preventative maintenance regimen utilizing RCM methodologies. This comprehensive guide, consisting of 107 pages and priced at approximately US$117, is a valuable resource for those looking to implement effective maintenance strategies.</p>

I totally agree that when seeking support from regulatory bodies, the emphasis should be on discussing technical integrity, reliability enhancements, and risk mitigation measures rather than solely focusing on costs or excessive efforts. These discussions will involve leveraging the RCM methodology to implement effective strategies for improvement. - Mike</p>

            <p>I apologize for the delay in responding to your question, Vee. I have attached both the UFC document and the technical report from the RCM study on fire protection. The technical report offers detailed information and serves as the foundation for the inspection, testing, and maintenance tasks and schedules outlined in the UFC document. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further inquiries. The attachment(s) include UFC_3-600-01.pdf (434 KB, 1 version).</p>
