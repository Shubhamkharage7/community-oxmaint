                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>The situation at hand involves a service technician from a subcontractor who made modifications to a Siemens PLC and HMI program on-site without backing up the changes. Unfortunately, the technician has since left the company, leaving the customer unable to locate the latest program for a minor adjustment. The subcontractor, more familiar with Rockwell systems, assumed they could simply upload the program from the PLC and HMI on-site. This lack of backup and documentation procedures is concerning, highlighting the need for a more stringent protocol.

However, there is a question regarding whether the same approach can be taken with Rockwell operator panels as with Siemens systems. While the user has experience with older Panelview models from 25 years ago, they are unsure if the same method applies to current Rockwell panels. Despite this not directly impacting the current issue, the quest for clarity remains important.</p>

            <p>The PanelView Plus line allows you to easily upload your program for added security. I often find it preferable to retrieve the file directly from the HMI to ensure there are no undocumented changes. Additionally, you can compare the file on the HMI to the one on your PC to verify their exact match. The programmer has the option to disable conversion back from the runtime or require a password for added protection. While I am not as familiar with their other HMI lines, I would be surprised if you were unable to extract the program from them as well.</p>

            <p>The ability to convert PanelView Plus firmware runtime back to a project for editing can vary depending on the version. Some earlier versions may not support this feature, but there are workarounds available, albeit cumbersome.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Thank you for the information. According to plvlce, the current Panelview Plus line allows you to upload the program, which is a valuable feature. It is important to always verify that the offline and online programs are identical to avoid any problems. If there are differences, it indicates a major issue that requires investigation. While it is convenient to upload the HMI program, it can also lead to neglecting to back up the programs, as seen in this case. It is crucial to ensure the integrity of both PLC and HMI programs before proceeding.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When transferring files from the HMI, you will be working with the runtime file (*.mer). With the updated Factory Talk View (FTV) Studio, you have the ability to restore the runtime file to a project for editing or saving. When uploading using a USB stick, it is crucial to have the proper file structure set up on the device. The Factory Talk View Application Manager software, included with FTV Studio, allows you to manage your programs effectively. You can restore, back up, copy, or delete programs using this tool. It is important to note that deleting programs directly from your computer without using this application can cause issues with FTV. Make sure to always use the Factory Talk View Application Manager for program deletion.</p>

            <p>According to Alan_505, the ability to convert PanelView Plus runtime back to a project for editing depends on the firmware version. Older versions may not allow this conversion, but newer versions like PVP+ 6 and PVP+ 7 offer this option. JesperMP added that while uploading the HMI program is convenient, it should not be used as a substitute for regular backups. Proper backups are essential to avoid unnecessary risks.</p>

            <p>According to Plvlce, the original PV+ did not support conversion to v5, but that was several versions ago. The current PVP+ 6 and PVP+ 7 both offer the option to convert back to older versions. Additionally, .mer files from V5+ can be converted to .APA files for modification and redownloading in the future.</p>
