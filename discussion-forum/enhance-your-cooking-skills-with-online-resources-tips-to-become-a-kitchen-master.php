            <p>I apologize for my confusion, but can you please explain what MathML is and how it is used in mathematical notation?</p>

            <p>Before completing this form and sharing opinions with Terry, I attempted to verify if the platform Groupee, which powers this board, has the capability to accommodate MathML. I sought assistance through Groupee's online support chat, which was incredibly helpful. Waiting for a Groupee representative to join the chat, Denise Fitzgerald greeted me and inquired how she could assist. I inquired about the compatibility of Groupee's bulletin board with MathML, a markup language for creating mathematical equations that some group members are interested in. While Denise was unsure, she suggested trying it out on Groupee's support community to see if it functions properly. If there are any updates, I requested that she inform me via email. The possibility of incorporating MathML into the system may be a moot point if the forum software does not support it.</p>

            <p>Dear Steve and all, we currently have HTML disabled in all posts, but we are open to setting up a board that allows it or enabling it on existing boards. I am not familiar with MathML and would appreciate a few volunteers to collaborate with me on a trial basis. If MathML simply converts to HTML, it should work fine. However, if it outputs a different format, it may not be compatible. There are various approaches to solving this issue. If you are interested, please post your interest here and enable email notifications so I can inform you when it is set up. Thank you, Terry O.</p>

            <p>Question from Kim Williams: Can someone explain to me what MathML is? If you're not familiar with MathML, it's a markup language for representing mathematical equations. You can learn more about MathML by visiting the official W3C documentation at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-MathML/.</p>
