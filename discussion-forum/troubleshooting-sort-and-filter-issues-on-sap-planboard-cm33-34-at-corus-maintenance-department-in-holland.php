                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>At Corus in Holland (Ijmuiden), we have successfully implemented the CRP (Capacity Requirements Planning) functionality for our maintenance department. However, during the regression test conducted before the official launch, we encountered two issues that need to be addressed. 

The first issue involves the incorrect consideration of available capacity in transaction CM33 when using the filter. The second issue pertains to the incorrect assignment of sort criteria to the charts in the Graphical Planning board created for the Corus maintenance department. The screen is divided into three separate sections: 
1. Workcenter load by Workcenter (Dispatched)
2. Workcenter Load by operation (Dispatched)
3. Operation pool (Not Dispatched)

Starting with the Sort issue, there are two Sort criteria assigned to the second chart and three to the third chart. However, there seems to be a cross-linking issue between the assignments, as selecting one chart may display the sort criteria of the other. Additionally, the operations are not sorting consecutively as expected. 

The more crucial problem lies in the filter and its impact on the correct consideration of available capacity. The standard SAP Filter (5KFIL4) assigned in the selection profile is causing dispatched operations to overlook the actual available capacity when the filter is activated. This issue became apparent when the workcenter became overloaded with dispatched orders, which is unacceptable. 

To resolve these issues, we seek assistance from anyone who may have a solution. Your prompt response is highly appreciated. Thank you, Frits.</p>

            <p>In SAP, the planning board operates as intended, taking into account specific work orders or a list of orders specified in the filter. When accessing the planning board from the IW32 transaction, SAP considers all orders with requirements for the work centers used by the initial order. This allows for a targeted evaluation of requirements and available capacity, aligning with your desired outcome.</p>
