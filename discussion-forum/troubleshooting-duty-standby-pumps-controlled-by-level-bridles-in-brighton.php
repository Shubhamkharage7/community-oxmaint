                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In Brighton, a new thread has been initiated with a question regarding duty/standby pumps controlled by level bridles on the reboiler upstream. These 4 KW pumps with mechanical seals experience shutdown when draining the level bridles, restarting shortly after. This process has been ongoing for 12 months, prompting the suggestion of implementing a Maintenance Override Switch (MOS) to prevent pump shutdowns. However, caution is advised before making any changes without a thorough HAZOP analysis. While the proposed solution may enhance pump performance, potential hazards related to monitoring and control of the MOS need to be evaluated to avoid any disasters. It is important to approach the problem with proper engineering and risk assessment before implementing any solutions. Rushing into a solution without fully understanding the issue and its consequences could lead to unforeseen complications.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The reboiler system is primarily designed to handle Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG), however, there is an issue with MEG and Gas Condensate mixing together. This causes condensate to build up on top of the MEG in the reboiler over time, resulting in inaccurate reboiler level readings in the control room due to the upper section of the bridles becoming filled.</p>

            <p>Indeed, removing the excess steam from a steam drum's level gauge is akin to draining it when steam builds up above the water level. This process is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and safety in steam systems.</p>
