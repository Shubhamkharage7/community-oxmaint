                    <p>Hello everyone! I'm looking for recommendations on chairs and desks for commissioning work. I'm tired of using makeshift options like empty cable rolls or kegs, especially since kneeling on a cold floor is uncomfortable for my knees. I'm hoping to find something portable that I can strap to my laptop backpack, as I often have to walk long distances. Perhaps there is a laptop bag/chair/table combo available. Please share what chairs and desks you use for commissioning. Thank you! - Mark</p>

            <p>I have come across several individuals using the Google Laptop Travel Tripod, but I personally prefer to simply request a table and chair from the customer to set up near the electrical cabinet. If these are not available or it is a brief assignment, I will make do with a cable drum or whatever is at hand.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>One option is to use the customer's table and chair, but since you are inquiring about it, that doesn't seem feasible. Alternatively, if you will be in the same location for an extended period, consider purchasing an affordable folding table and chair from a retail store like Target or Walmart and expensing it. The customer will eventually provide a table regardless. A travel tripod may be more suitable if you anticipate moving frequently or working on short-term projects. In such cases, using a "top of panel" method or spools is common practice.</p>

        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I always relied on mk42's second option for my needs. If there was a fold-down shelf in the electrical enclosure, I could simply purchase a chair and store it inside to keep it secure and stationary. This setup would prevent the chair from moving around on its own.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>mk42 suggested two options for workspace setup:
Option 1: using the customer's table and chair was not considered feasible. 
Option 2: If working in the same location for an extended period, purchasing an inexpensive folding table and chair from retailers like Target or Walmart and expensing it may be a more practical solution. In situations where mobility is key, such as upgrading firmware on multiple drives, a travel tripod may be preferable. Additionally, the makeshift solution of balancing equipment on nearby surfaces like the top of a panel or parts bin is also mentioned.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When it comes to portable seating solutions, a laptop tripod chair can make all the difference. As someone who is constantly on the move and visiting different locations, I have found these chairs to be a lifesaver. Not only are they versatile, but they also attract a lot of attention wherever I go. The adjustable height feature is perfect for anyone, whether you're looking for a low folding chair or need something tall enough for a 7-foot-tall person. Additionally, using speaker stands to mount the table on allows for a customizable and lightweight option. If you're interested in enhancing your on-the-go setup, a laptop tripod chair is a must-have.</p>

            <p>One of the best investments I've ever made was purchasing a $46 cocktail table from Sam's Club. The product can be found on Grainger's website with part number 12F622. It's a shame that the URL contains a word that some may find inappropriate, especially since comedian George Carlin famously argued that "cocktail" shouldn't be seen as a dirty word.</p>

            <p>Are you tired of feeling like your legs are weighed down after hours of using a laptop in one spot? A solution that works well for many is using a folding aluminum camping table and a three-legged camping stool. This convenient setup allows for easy transport, as the stool fits inside the table bag and can be carried over your shoulder. However, the downside is that everyone seems to think the table is free for anyone to use.</p>

            <p>When working in the field, I find standing more convenient than constantly getting up and down. My work often involves moving between field devices, panels, and my laptop, and I prefer to stay on my feet for flexibility. The heavy-duty table I use serves multiple purposes beyond just programming, making it a versatile tool for various tasks. Whether I'm on the go or stationed in one spot for hours, standing keeps me agile and efficient in my work.</p>

            <p>Over the past three decades, I've relied on a variety of makeshift items - from a 5 gallon bucket and pull string pail to a wire spool and stack of pallets - for my work. While some may opt for fancy folding tables, I prefer the practicality of these humble tools. And don't get me started on the "back in my day" stories - I practically walked to work in the snow barefoot uphill both ways. Millennials, take note.</p>

            <p>In the past three decades, I have found great utility in unconventional items such as a 5-gallon bucket, pull-string pail, wire spool, trashcan, stack of pallets, the floor, cardboard box, and break room chair. While some may opt for fancy folding tables, I have always made do with what's at hand. I even humorously lamented about walking barefoot uphill both ways in the snow to get to work, contrasting with the perceived ease of the younger generation. As I approach my twentieth year in this routine, I find myself considering alternatives like tripods to accommodate my frequent movements. Here's to staying adaptable and resourceful! Cheers!</p>

            <p>As people age, some seem to defy the effects of time better than others. Personally, being over 50, I am constantly reminded of my age by my achy knee. I've found that a folding plastic 6-foot table and chair are my go-to setup, providing ample space for my laptop, notes, and documents. And if you're traveling to a job site, don't forget to include an extra $100 in your quote for the electricians. They'll appreciate it when you leave it behind.</p>

I am tired of resorting to makeshift options like empty cable rolls or kegs, especially since kneeling on cold floors is no longer comfortable for me.

Additionally, I found a useful item on Amazon which served me well when I needed it. I was working wirelessly with a control system and needed a convenient surface for my laptop while monitoring activities in the field. Although I don't use it frequently, it proved to be a valuable tool in such situations. Check it out here: [Amazon link]</p>

            <p>According to JeffKiper, using a 4' folding table from Walmart and a bag chair is a quick and convenient setup. In case they are stolen, the customer is charged $100. However, based on my experience, it's more a matter of WHEN they get stolen, haha. These items are meant to be disposable, so it's like they are "involuntarily donated" anyways.</p>

            <p>mk42 mentioned that it's more a matter of "WHEN it gets stolen" rather than if, based on their experience. These items are essentially designed to be disposable, so it's almost like they are meant to be "involuntarily donated." The term "re-appropriated" is often used to describe this situation, which is essentially the same thing, just with a different label. This is definitely a common occurrence that may end up in my scrapbook.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>An alternative option is to invest in a budget-friendly folding table and chair from a popular retailer like Target or Walmart and have the expense reimbursed by the customer. This practice is common among professionals who have to work at the same location for an extended period. By purchasing affordable furniture from stores like Home Depot or Lowes and charging it back to the client, you not only save money but also create the convenience of having equipment readily available for future visits. This strategy ensures that you are well-equipped for your next job and saves time on setting up furniture each time you return to the location.</p>
