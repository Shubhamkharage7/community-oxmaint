                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>What is the quickest way to reset the accumulated time for a full RTO array? I have attempted using FAL with both a 0 and a blank array of 0s, but it did not work as expected. I've experimented with indirect addressing and trying .acc before and after the tag. While I could individually reset each item in the array, I am seeking a faster solution. One approach I am considering is resetting the timers collectively with RES TAGNAME[0-23]. Will this potentially cause a fault, or will resetting multiple timers simultaneously within the range [0-23] function correctly? Any suggestions on how to tackle this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, Miguel13 expressed interest in resetting a timer using the command "RES TAGNAME[0-23]." While this command compiles, there is concern about potential faults. Resetting multiple timers at once with [0-23] may not work as intended. RES is designed to operate on a single tag, so using [0-23] could result in an index out of bounds error. A properly formatted FAL may be a better solution. Can you provide more details on what you have tried with that?</p>

            <p>It is logical to consider the -23Below issue. Attached is a screenshot showcasing my previous successful FAL on DINTs. However, this is my first attempt at performing it on an array of TIMERS. Unsure if I overlooked something. Could the problem have been with a DINT in place of zeros in the blank array where I was attempting the FAL on TIMERS?</p>

            <p>When using the FAL method to reset all accumulators to zero, does it also handle the DN bit? It is important to note that any DN bits that are set will likely remain set until the CPU reaches the next RTO instruction for each timer involved. While this may not be significant for your needs, it is worth considering in your application. Personally, I appreciate fancy solutions as long as they are well-documented, but I do have a preference for straightforward brute force methods.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Inquiring about the FAL method for resetting accumulators also raises questions about the status of the DN bit. It's important to be aware that any DN bits that are set will remain so until the CPU encounters the next RTO instruction for the affected timers. This detail may seem insignificant, but could have implications in certain applications. It's worth noting that the FAL method alone does not update the .DN status, meaning it would stay set until the RTO is scanned. In certain scenarios, the logic may be structured to scan each RTO after the FAL but before using its DN bit, mitigating any potential issues.</p>
