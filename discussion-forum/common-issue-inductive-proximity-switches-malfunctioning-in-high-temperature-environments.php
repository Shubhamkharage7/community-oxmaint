                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I was astonished to witness a peculiar occurrence firsthand. Our maintenance team recently discovered a recurring issue with a 30mm inductive prox switch used to detect pallets on a conveyor system. This switch would often malfunction when exposed to heat, causing it to stick closed. However, once it cooled down, it would start functioning again. Surprisingly, this was a common issue that our staff had encountered several times, leading to the replacement of multiple switches, including the Allen-Bradley 872C-D15NP30-D4 model. Despite some switches being replaced before, others were still the original ones dating back to 2016. The tropical weather conditions of 36C temperature and 52% humidity, making it feel like 44C, seemed to be exacerbating the problem. Have you also faced such challenges with inductive prox switches in high-temperature environments like ours?</p>

            <p>I have observed frequent occurrences of sensor malfunction in welded processes due to improper sensor placement or proximity to heat sources. In my experience, this issue is not typically caused by ambient temperatures alone, but rather by processes generating substantial heat. Our preferred sensors for these applications are primarily Turck proxes.</p>

            <p>Instead of depending on ambient temperature, it is important to consider the actual temperature the sensor is experiencing. Instead of continuously replacing faulty sensors with the same issue, it is advisable to reach out to different proximity sensor manufacturers for alternative solutions. A quick search on the web led me to various options such as inductive proximity sensors from KEYENCE Canada, Pepperl+Fuchs Canada, ifm, Turck Canada Inc., and Balluff. These sensors offer reliable non-contact detection for a variety of applications. Contacting these manufacturers could help resolve production losses and improve efficiency.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that inductive sensors can also detect non-metallic substances like conductive ceramics. When designing a kiln for diesel car exhaust particle filters made of ceramics, we initially used capacitive sensors to detect the movement of silicon carbide plates. However, they performed poorly with continuous false alarms. After realizing that inductive sensors could also detect the SiC ceramic plates, we replaced them with Schneider inductive sensors. This solved all detection issues and ensured smooth operation, even in the high temperatures of the oven.</p>

            <p>BryanG inquired about the actual temperature the sensor is reaching instead of relying on ambient conditions. When facing issues with proximity sensors, it is beneficial to contact different manufacturers for equivalent products instead of constantly replacing the same faulty sensor. Some reputable manufacturers to consider are KEYENCE, Pepperl+Fuchs, ifm, Turck Canada Inc., and Balluff. Automation Direct proximity switches have proven to be cost-effective replacements, costing only about 10% of AB replacements while working just as effectively.</p>

            <p>These configurations refer to PNP polarity. Have you checked for reversed polarity? Is there a specific load being activated, or is the connection directly to the PLC? If connected to an isolated input card, it's possible that a short circuit is causing the proximity sensor to enter overload "protection" mode.</p>

            <p>Over the years, I have had my doubts about the quality of AB products since 2006. We faced several issues with a machine featuring ML1500, PV+, AB drives, where multiple PV's and drives failed within a short period. It seemed that the design flaw caused the PLC & PV to shut off during an e-stop. After modifying the controls to keep the PLC & PV running during an e-stop, the situation improved but we still encountered frequent failures. We gradually replaced the AB drives with Mitsubishi ones and the PV with a Beijers due to constant failures. Furthermore, we experienced multiple failures of AB safety relays, which we replaced with Pilz and another brand, resulting in a significant drop in equipment failures. In my 45 years of experience, I had never encountered issues with AB products before. The replacement equipment not only proved to be more reliable but also cost-effective. It is clear that the quality of AB products may have diminished over time.</p>

            <p>Approximately 9 years ago, two drilling units I was overseeing in a tropical country experienced a total of 12 proximity switch failures over a weekend. Despite having been delivered to my company two years apart, it was unlikely that these faults were from the same batch. 
The proximity switches were found to be stuck on and power cycling did not resolve the issue. After bringing them to an air conditioned workshop, they operated normally at the specified distance. Curious about the root cause, I reached out to P+F for assistance. They attributed the malfunctions to the tropical weather and provided a credit note for some of the faulty switches. Unfortunately, I was demoted and ceased investigating further. The day of the failures was hot, but not unusually so, although the crew may have been acclimated to different climates, affecting their perception of the conditions.</p>
