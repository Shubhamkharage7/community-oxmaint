                    <p>Hello everyone, we are currently in the process of assessing and tracking MTBF, MTTR, and equipment availability in our SAP system. One major concern we have is determining the most effective method for calculating these key performance indicators. The primary issue lies in defining the "downtime" of equipment. 

Option 1 involves calculating downtime for any type of downtime, whether planned or unplanned, with the exception of Preventive MTC. 

On the other hand, Option 2 focuses on calculating downtime only for unplanned incidents, such as breakdowns, excluding any planned downtime. 

In my opinion, Option 1 appears to be the most accurate approach, but I welcome your input and valuable opinions on this matter. Thank you for your insights. Best regards.

            <p>Hello Nadee, I'm a bit unclear on this. If the downtime is scheduled, wouldn't that fall under preventive maintenance? In our manufacturing facility, MTBF (mean time between failures) is calculated as the average time between one failure and the next occurrence on a specific item. This calculation is not affected by the actual duration of breakdowns. Thanks, Mike.</p>

            <p>In a previous discussion, I highlighted the importance of considering all planned downtimes, such as scheduled overhauls, planned shutdowns, and run-to-failures, when calculating Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). By incorporating these factors, which involve human intervention, into the calculation rather than solely focusing on unplanned downtimes like breakdowns, a more comprehensive and accurate picture of MTBF is obtained. Excluding planned downtimes, shutdowns, and run-to-failures may artificially inflate MTBF metrics, giving a false impression of reliability.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Hello Nadee, Let's take a moment to delve into the concept of MTBF, which stands for Mean Time Between Failures. It is calculated by dividing the total operating hours by the number of failures. A failure occurs when an item cannot meet its expected performance standards.

It's important to note that planned replacements should not be considered failures since the item is still functioning as expected. However, replacements based on predictive maintenance (PdM) readings are considered failure events, as performance degradation has already begun.

Breakdowns and rework are also classified as failure events. In reliability analysis, planned events are treated as "censoring" points where partial failure contributions are factored in. When conducting a reliability analysis, planned events and breakdowns are both included but treated differently.

Consistency is key when analyzing MTBF. Stick to a method and definition that align with your reporting system. Use the corresponding downtime data to calculate MTTR, measuring downtime from stoppage to full capacity operation.

Extracting accurate data from a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) can be challenging. It's crucial to differentiate between preventative maintenance (PM), condition-based maintenance (CM), and breakdown maintenance (BM) events. Despite potential errors in data, consistency in computation method is essential.

Consider how to use MTBF, MTTR, and Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) data, anticipate possible errors, and establish a clear definition of failure upfront. Decision-making is often not heavily influenced by exact MTBF or MTTF values, as long as consistency is maintained in the analysis.</p>

            <p>Hi Nadee, I am involved in working with mobile plant operations. Our methodology sets us apart as we refer to it as "MTBS" (with the "S" standing for stoppages) instead of the traditional "MTBF". We are keen on identifying any factor that causes a machine to come to a halt and be unavailable for operations. Under this framework, we encompass all interruptions except for refueling, lubrication, and daily operator inspections. This encompasses Preventative Maintenance shutdowns, as well as both planned and unplanned stoppages of the machines. We also track MTTR to analyze how quickly we can resolve these stoppages. By applying Pareto analysis to these metrics, we can identify which machine systems are contributing the most to downtime. This allows us to allocate resources efficiently towards addressing issues – for example, excessive troubleshooting time for engine electrical system repairs may signal a need for additional training or investment in tools and facilities. Our belief is to encompass all factors affecting machine availability, as these directly impact the productive capacity of operations. This comprehensive approach enables us to fine-tune our reporting requirements to suit various needs. Kind regards, Matt.</p>

            <p>Should we factor in time-based maintenance overhauls of rotating equipment when calculating Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)? These scheduled overhauls typically occur during planned shutdowns, involving the replacement of bearings and seals. These scheduled maintenance procedures are referred to as "reworks" in the RCM report of N&H. It is important to establish consistent trends based on your own definitions, but it can be beneficial to compare or benchmark against industry standards. For instance, I once heard of a pump in a refinery having an MTBF of up to 7 years. How did they achieve this without any shutdowns? Following standard definitions for MTBF can help in setting ambitious targets.

A modern CMMS should have the capability to prompt users to document downtimes in relevant work orders, with the downtime field being a required entry. For example, for work orders categorized as BM, PM, or CP with Plant Maintenance Activity Type as Overhaul and/or system status as Shutdown, downtime should be recorded. Similarly, for CM work orders with activity type as Repair, downtime should be recorded if the system status is Shutdown, and not recorded if it is Running. When it comes to PM work orders with Plant Maintenance Activity Type related to testing and System status as shutdown, determining downtime in case of a failure can be challenging. In such cases, it may be recommended to input a minimal downtime of 1 hour to indicate a hidden failure. However, it is worth noting that not all CMMS platforms may include the Plant Maintenance Activity field.</p>

            <p>Josh: Scheduled maintenance overhauls are different from MTBF calculations and can actually lead to reliability issues. During my time in the motor repair industry, we would anticipate these planned overhauls with a sense of certainty. However, we were also aware that a certain percentage of these overhauls could result in problems, prompting us to adjust our field service and repair department plans accordingly. Some failures were the result of the repair itself, while many others stemmed from issues during re-installation. While scheduled overhauls can influence MTBF outcomes, they should not be included in MTBF calculations. - Howard</p>

            <p>One important consideration is the actual run time of an item. In some cases, when an item is in standby mode, the CMMS may mistakenly count it as running, leading to inaccurate data. It's crucial to accurately determine the true run time to optimize equipment efficiency and maintenance schedules.</p>

            <p>Matt commonly uses the term MTTStoppage instead of MTBFailure, encompassing time-based overhauls. David.T, can we input running hours and downtime? Additionally, equipment may need to be dismantled and installed when replaced. To facilitate this process, any spare parts held in cold standby at the warehouse/store should be registered as equipment in order to obtain a unique identification number, rather than treating them as mere spare parts without a field for running hours. Hot standby items should be labeled with an equipment number tag.</p>

            <p>In the realm of semiconductor manufacturing, the industry has adopted the formula MTBF = Uptime/# of failures as the standard metric for measuring equipment reliability. Failures are defined as any unplanned interruptions that result in equipment being forced into an unscheduled downtime state.
