            <p>The Auto-Logout feature is a common issue that users encounter when using FactoryTalk. To troubleshoot this issue, try logging in through the FT Administration Console instead of closing and reopening FTView Studio. This approach may help you to quickly regain access to your FactoryTalk account. For more information and troubleshooting tips, visit the link provided.</p>

            <p>Hello Ken,

I am encountering an issue in the FT Admin console where the log-in option appears greyed out, suggesting that I may already be logged in. Despite trying to log out and log back in, I was prompted to change my password due to it expiring. After changing the password and logging back in, I still faced difficulty in saving the screens I was working on. It's puzzling because I didn't experience any issues while working on the project last night. The only difference I can think of is that today, in addition to the project, I also have RS Logix 5000 open. However, I don't see how this could be related to the problem.

I appreciate your assistance,
Mark</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing logout issues in your Studio program, a quick fix is to open a second Studio, transfer your work to a new page, and close the malfunctioning one. Then, reopen the other Studio, copy your items back into the original project, and close all Studio programs. Follow these steps to resolve the logout problem efficiently.</p>

            <p>Have you experienced this issue lately? I have set my login session expiration time to 0 in three different locations: the security policy properties of the project, and in the FT admin console for both local and network directories. Despite this, I still encounter random issues when trying to save a screen, resulting in an error message. When this happens, I am forced to restart my system in order to access the project again.</p>

            <p>Investing in a new laptop has greatly improved my workflow. I have learned the importance of saving my work frequently to avoid any potential setbacks. One helpful tip is to open a second Studio and transfer your current work to a page in the new Studio. After doing so, close the original project and reopen it. You can then delete the old work and copy the updated version from the second Studio back into your original project. This method ensures that you never lose any progress.</p>
