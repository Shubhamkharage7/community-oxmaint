                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Good evening! I need more information on Solid State Relays as I am dealing with a system containing 8 120VAC Vibrators. These Solid State Relays require a 4-32 VDC input. Despite the analog input reading 24VDC, none of the Vibrators are functioning. Can any voltage between 4 to 32 volts activate the Solid State Relay? Additionally, there are Diodes on the wires connected to the Vibrators. When I disconnected the wires from the Solid State Relays and connected them to a 120VAC terminal, all 8 Vibrators operated. Does the output of 4-32 VDC from the PLC control the amount of 120VAC that flows through to the Vibrators? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Is this a new system that is currently being set up, or is it an existing system that was previously operational? You mentioned that all 8 SSRs are not allowing voltage or current to pass to energize the vibrators. In this case, it is likely that the issue lies elsewhere and not with the SSRs. The SSR model you have is "instant-on", meaning it will switch on with any voltage between 4-32VDC. While SSRs can fail, they usually fail in a closed state rather than an open one. May I ask what PLC and output card/module you are utilizing?</p>

            <p>If your vibrators are wired to a 120VAC power source and running non-stop, the solid state relay intended to control them is no longer functioning properly. The absence of a functioning DC signal to activate the relay is causing issues. It is essential to troubleshoot the lack of DC (+) voltage on terminal A1 (+) to determine the root of the problem.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>To check the operation of your relay, use a meter to measure the voltage at the VDC and VAC terminals. Place the probes on the plus/minus of the relay where the DC connects to determine the Voltage. Then, place the red probe on one terminal of the relay and the black probe on ground to check for 120VAC. If you have DC voltage applied and 120VAC on both AC terminals, your SSR is working properly. However, if you have VDC but only 120VAC on one terminal, your SSR may be faulty. And if you have VDC but no 120VAC on either terminal, there may be an issue with your 120VAC supply.</p>

            <p>I wholeheartedly concur with robertmee #6: it is essential to measure all relay "circuits." Baker from Virginia pointed out the presence of diodes on the wires connecting to the Vibrators. Are there really diodes in the 120VAC circuits? As someone who is not well-versed in electrical work, I have a query for experts: How will the anti-parallel thyristor function in the presence of a diode in the switched circuit?</p>

Just to address some inquiries: This machine has been operating in its current state for years, but has had recurring problems with the vibrators. Each wire connected to the vibrators is equipped with a diode for protection. The input of the Solid State relays registers approximately 24 VDC.

            <p>A baker in Virginia mentioned that the 120 vac from the Solid State Relay to the vibrators has a diode connected to it. This diode is likely used to "clip" the bottom wave. With the diode, only half of the wave conducts, potentially affecting the SSR's functioning. To test this, consider adding a resistive load like a soldering iron or a 100W incandescent bulb in parallel with the diode and vibrator. Additionally, try reversing the cables at the SSR output terminals. Another user, robertmee, asked if the diode is in series or parallel, noting that if it were in parallel, something would have likely burnt out, possibly even the fuse.</p>

            <p>In electronics, using a diode can cause only half of a wave to conduct, potentially affecting the operation of a Solid State Relay (SSR). To improve functionality, consider adding a resistive load in parallel with the diode and vibrator setup, such as a 100W incandescent bulb or soldering iron. Additionally, try reversing the cables at the SSR output terminals to troubleshoot any issues. If something had been connected incorrectly, such as in parallel, a fuse may have blown. This situation often occurs when a back EMF diode is used in a DC circuit.</p>

            <p>It is important to ensure that the diode is functioning properly, especially under load. If the diode fails in a short circuit, the vibrator will not receive the expected rectified power feed. On the other hand, if the diode fails in an open circuit, no power will be transmitted. Make sure to regularly check the diode's performance to prevent any issues with the power supply.</p>

            <p>SSR Operation: The control voltage for SSRs typically ranges from 4-32VDC, with some models also available in AC versions. When applying 24VDC to the control input (ensure correct polarity), it triggers the "latch" mechanism of the output. Essentially, SSRs act as electronic switches. To test the functionality, check for close to 0 ohms on the output when 24VDC is present at the control input, or ensure both sides of the output show the same voltage when powered. If only the input side has voltage, it indicates a faulty SSR. In my experience, SSRs tend to fail in the closed position 99% of the time, although there have been instances of failures to open.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your assistance. Tomorrow, I plan to utilize a 24 VDC power supply to simulate the analog output. Surprisingly, none of the vibrators are functioning with the solid state relays. I will test the 24 VDC power supply on the solid state relay input. I have confirmed a 24 VDC reading on all the solid state relay inputs from the analog outputs. It is puzzling why they did not opt for 24 VDC digital outputs instead of analog. Your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Based on the datasheet, these relays require a DC voltage for instant on switching. If the goal is to control vibrator speed, an SSR may not be the suitable choice.</p>

            <p>Parky expressed concerns about using an analog signal to drive relays. According to the datasheet, a DC voltage should be used instead. The "B" type relay is designed for instant on switching, triggering as soon as a voltage is detected on the input. Is the goal to adjust the vibrator speed? If so, a different type of relay may be more suitable. An ordinary SSR can potentially be utilized with an analog signal if necessary adjustments are made. However, this was not specifically mentioned, and using an analog signal without proper implementation may not be effective.</p>

            <p>It is a possibility that Bubba may have substituted the original 4-20mA or 0-10V controlled SSR's with something they believed would work. This is not uncommon in situations where inexperienced engineers make substitutions based on assumptions. It is important to check if the current installed parts match the original drawings. Baker, could you confirm if this is the case? Additionally, while the analog card operates at 24V, the standard voltage supply is typically either 0-10V or (0) 4-20mA signal. If the current output cards are being used, adjusting the current may not affect the control of the SSR, as they are designed for digital switching rather than variable control.</p>

            <p>A baker from Virginia is seeking more information about Solid State Relays and their compatibility with 120V AC vibrators. The Solid State Relays in question have a 4-32VDC input, but despite a 24VDC analog input, the vibrators are not functioning. The baker is curious about the meaning of the 4-32VDC range and whether any voltage within that range can trigger the relay. Additionally, there are diodes on the wires connected to the vibrators. When the wires were temporarily connected to a 120VAC terminal, all 8 vibrators operated successfully. The baker wonders if the output of the PLC, set within the 4-32VDC range, determines the amount of 120VAC that passes through to the vibrators. Any insights on optimizing this setup would be greatly appreciated.</p>
