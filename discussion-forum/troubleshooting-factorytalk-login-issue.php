            <p>Welcome to the forum! This prompt is requesting you to access your FactoryTalk directory, which is utilized by all Rockwell products with security features enabled. By default, when installing version 20 of RSLogix 5000, security verification is enabled, with the "network" security server set as the local host PC. 

If you are using FactoryTalk AssetCentre software, it is likely that you are configured to use a remote server PC as your security authority. In this case, you should already have a user ID and password set up to access the server. If you are not utilizing a remote server for security, the login prompt is simply asking for your user ID and password for local Windows login credentials.

To eliminate this prompt, navigate to Start - All Programs - Rockwell Software - FactoryTalk Administration Console. Log in to "Local" as your Windows user with administration privileges, then proceed to Policies - System Policies - Security Policy and enable "Single Sign-On." This feature allows for seamless login to the FT directory after logging in to Windows, removing the need to log in separately to individual products.

If this solution does not work and your Windows user credentials are not accepted, it may be due to a lack of administration rights on your PC or a misconfiguration of the directory pointing to a non-existent remote server. In such cases, reconfiguring the FactoryTalk NETWORK directory to use the local host as the network server may be necessary to restore functionality to your Logix.

If you require assistance with this reconfiguration process, feel free to reach out for guidance. Dealing with FactoryTalk security concerns has been an unexpected learning experience that I am more than willing to share insights on.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Starting from version 20 of RSLogix 5000, it is now necessary to set up the FactoryTalk Network Directory. While the Local Directory is automatically configured by default, the Network Directory needs to be configured separately. To do this, navigate to Programs > Rockwell Software > FactoryTalk Tools > FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard. Be sure to check the box for configuring the Network Directory as it is not selected by default. You can keep the Local Directory box checked. 

During the configuration process, you will need to enter your user name and password for the Network Directory. If you are an administrator for your computer, you should be able to input your credentials. If not, you may need assistance from your IT/IS department. You will also need to provide credentials for the Local Directory. Once the Network Directory is set up, you should be able to open RSLogix 5000 without any prompts.

It is important to note that this process does not apply if you are using any security server products mentioned by bmacattack33.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information provided, but I am still encountering an issue in the factory. There are two users present: one is an administrator who functions effectively, while the other does not have administrator privileges. As a result, it is mandatory for the non-administrator user to log in to Factory Talk every time they log off Windows. However, with Version 19, this additional step is no longer required. Can you assist me in resolving this issue?</p>

            <p>If you are encountering issues with RSLogix 5000 version 20 and later, you must configure the FactoryTalk Network Directory. The Local Directory is automatically set up by default, but not the Network Directory. To configure the Network Directory, follow these steps: navigate to Programs > Rockwell Software > FactoryTalk Tools > FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard. Make sure to check the box to configure the Network Directory, as it is not selected by default. You can keep the Local Directory box checked as well.

When prompted, enter your username and password for the Network Directory. If you are an administrator for your computer, you should be able to enter this information. If you are not an Administrator, contact your IT/IS department for assistance. You will need to provide credentials again for the Local Directory.

Once the Network Directory is configured, you should be able to open RSLogix 5000 without any prompts. Note that this solution does not apply to security server products mentioned by bmacattack33. If you encounter this issue again, refer back to these steps. Thanks, Operaghost (OG).</p>

            <p>Looking to provide some valuable insight on this topic, as this page ranks highly on Google for it: Upon installation of RSLogix 5000 v20, if you add the following two components from Rockwell's Compatibility & Downloads page, it may appear that the FactoryTalk Directory login prompts become inactive (please note that a Rockwell account is required for download access): FactoryTalk Services 3.0 (3.00.00-FTServices-A-DVD) - it is possible that newer versions will also be compatible, but this has not been confirmed. Additionally, the January 2019 Patch roll-up (Patches-02.Jan.2019) should work, and it is likely that subsequent patch roll-ups will also be effective.</p>

            <p>For a lasting fix, you may need to utilize IT/Administrator credentials in order to establish a user on FactoryTalk Administration Console. To ensure a permanent solution, consider creating a Windows-Linked User for the account in question. Another option is to set up FactoryTalk Users who will be required to log in themselves. For a step-by-step guide, check out the video tutorial linked below. Hope this information proves helpful!</p>

            <p>Uncertain about its usefulness, but if you recently changed the name of your PC, it may result in an issue. To resolve this, simply rename your computer back to its original name. If you cannot recall the PC name, check the autosave files from RSLogix as the name should be encoded in one of them. Best of luck in resolving the issue!</p>

A user named PLC Weasel suggested that if you recently renamed your computer, it could be causing the problem. Simply reverting the computer name back to its original one should fix the issue. If you can't recall the original name, you can find it in the autosave files from RSLogix. Good luck resolving the issue!</p>

I encountered problems with the FactoryTalk Directory Configuration Wizard displaying errors when attempting to set up the local directory after changing the computer name.

Despite only having one post, Big Dave shared a hidden gem from Rockwell that works wonders. This tool is particularly effective when removing a client from a network FTD without access to the host computer, useful for integrators who may have used a VM as a temporary client on an end user's system. The tool bypasses the need for credentials on the current FTD, effortlessly resetting the network FTD back to default configuration and localhost. It's a game-changer for those no longer connected to the original network.</p>

            <p>I am uncertain if the silentFTDCW tool referenced earlier has similar capabilities, but it's reassuring to discover existing integrated solutions. Typically, we address these issues using the "FactoryTalk View Studio: Restore Directory (ResDir) Utility" (ResDir.exe), which is available for download on the Rockwell support page.</p>

            <p>If you're experiencing issues after renaming your PC, try reverting back to the original name to solve the problem. If you can't remember the previous name, check the autosave files from RSLogix as it should be embedded in one of them. Good luck! This solution worked for me. Thank you, PLC Weasel.</p>
