After conducting a quick comparison between different software packages and manual processes using a regular worksheet, I noticed that the systems mainly excel in organization and tracking capabilities. However, if these are the only benefits they offer, it may not justify making the switch, as the output seems to be similar to manual methods. Do you share my opinion on this matter? Regards.</p>

            <p>Suppose you have a pump with a gasket that starts leaking after a certain period, causing inconvenience. To avoid this, you decide to replace the gasket preventively and determine the most cost-effective interval for doing so. By analyzing recorded events and calculating the approximate working hours between each event, you are able to identify patterns. After inputting this data into a software program that utilizes the least square and median ranking methods, a Weibull probability distribution with specific parameters is generated. This distribution, with an r2 value of 0.9252, best fits the data and helps determine the recommended time interval for preventive maintenance (PM). Taking into account costs, task times, and required accuracy, the software suggests a PM interval of 2750 working hours, resulting in the lowest maintenance cost of 4.30 €/100 working hours. It is important to note that at 2750 hours, the probability of a failure necessitating corrective maintenance (CM) is 0.058. As data continues to accumulate, regular reviews and updates of maintenance strategies will be necessary for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>Rui – a case study for optimal PM intervals. By excluding the two suggested samples for censoring, the remaining failure intervals are as follows: 4849, 4612, 3977, 3037, 4962, 3239, 3833, 4625, operating hours. Upon initial review, it appears that PM intervals of 3000 hours could be implemented without significant risk of failure, or even 2900 hours for added assurance. In a cost-conscious industry, this seems more favorable than the calculated 2750 hours. When should a modification, such as gasket redesign, be considered to extend PM intervals? Who should be tasked with conducting in-depth analyses within a plant? 

The data in this example appears to span approximately 5 years of continuous operation. How can data continuity be ensured in a rapidly changing workforce environment? How is data validation conducted and who oversees this process? Is there a mechanism in place for ongoing revalidation of PM intervals to accommodate potential changes in failure rates due to evolving process conditions?

While this example pertains to a single component (gasket), how can an optimal PM interval be determined for an entire machine? For instance, when bearings may fail between 5 and 10 years without ample data for calculation.</p>

            <p>quote: In response to Josh's query about calculating preventive maintenance intervals based on real plant data, I want to clarify that the example I provided in my previous post was hypothetical. However, I do use this scientific method in my own practice when I have reliable data, after consulting with operators and management. The effectiveness of this approach lies in achieving a balance between the costs of corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM). By determining the frequency of PM actions, such as the time interval between each action, I strive to minimize the overall maintenance costs. This leads to increased efficiency, where the same results are achieved at a reduced cost. Regards.</p>

            <p>Dear Buzz, thank you for your interest in the data analysis. Censoring data is not the same as rejecting data. Censored data are manipulated differently in calculations compared to complete data, serving as a unique statistical method. It is important to consider all data points, as they play a crucial role in the analysis. After censoring two observations, there are still 10 observations remaining.

Upon inspection, it is suggested that a preventive maintenance (PM) interval of 3000 hours, or even 2900 hours for added assurance, would be a better choice than the calculated value of 2750 hours. Performing a sensitivity analysis around the global cost minimum point reveals a range of time intervals from 2500 to 3250 hours. This offers flexibility in decision-making, with the choice of 2900 hours being cost-effective.

Determining when a modification like gasket redesign or material build is necessary to extend the PM interval involves following the decision diagram of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) prior to any calculations. Any industrial engineer trained in Reliability and Maintainability can conduct such analyses.

Ensuring data validity and consistency is essential in maintenance planning. Revalidation of the original PM interval to accommodate changes in failure rates due to process variations can be achieved through following RCM methodology. It is possible to optimize PM intervals for individual components or entire machines by leveraging available data sources and expert judgment.

In cases where sufficient data is lacking, adjustments can be made based on manufacturer recommendations or expert insights. It is essential to recognize that manufacturers may not fully understand the specific consequences of failures in a given context, necessitating independent analysis. RCM methodology provides guidance in this process.

Kind regards,
Rui</p>

            <p>When conducting calculations at the machine or equipment level with multiple failure modes such as gasket, bearing, and coupling, how should data be handled during the analysis? Can reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) curves be derived from the same dataset? It is possible to gather data for this analysis through the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) by creating work orders for both routine maintenance tasks and untracked modification works.</p>

            <p>Hi Josh, I previously discussed this topic in a forum thread, which you can find here: http://maintenanceforums.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/209103451/m/4671048281. I have attached two images of a software package illustrating a hypothetical scenario with 9 components (which could also represent different failure modes of the same component - all forming a series system in terms of reliability). The images demonstrate the outcomes of two maintenance management policies: Condition-Based Maintenance (CM) and Preventive Maintenance (PM). This example can be expanded to include any number of components or failure modes, as well as other PM strategies like fixed calendar time or block replacement to make use of scheduled downtimes.

            <p>Hello, gentlemen. I found your argument quite intriguing and I am inclined to side with Josh on this matter. However, I feel that the discussion has deviated slightly from the main question. When it comes to RCM2 analysis, are you seeking a quick and simple solution with a focus on the manual process, or are you interested in a software that can provide in-depth analytical data? What specific purpose do you have in mind for the software?</p>
