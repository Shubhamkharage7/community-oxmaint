            <p>While the pins may be identical, the compatibility of the Rx3i hinges on the specific protocol you intend to utilize. It's worth noting that the SNPx protocol is not supported by the Rx3i. Find more information on this topic in the GE IP forums: http://forums.ge-ip.com/showthread.php?t=8149&highlight=snpx.</p>

            <p>A user named geniusintraining stated that they are trying to determine the configuration of ports in order to help a customer who needs to communicate with an RX3i using a cable designed for the 90/30 (DB15). Wondering if the RX3i and 90/30 have the same communication compatibility, the user referenced a post on a popular forum. While unsure, they wanted to confirm before advising the customer. It is essential to clarify which ports are being used in each CPU or system and verify the protocol being used. Trust in the expertise provided, as the user is committed to giving accurate information and ensuring the customer is properly taken care of.</p>

            <p>RussB reassured: "Have faith in me, I will always lead you in the right direction." However, I have my doubts, as the saying goes, "I believe my lying eyes." Russ inquired about the necessity of a cable in their inventory that could communicate between 15-pin RS-485 ports.

Admitting a lack of expertise in GE products, the customer forwarded an email about their experience with GE cables, thanking Russ and Steve for their reliable products. The customer mentioned purchasing an IC690USB901 cable for connecting to GE PLCS, successfully communicating with a 9030 PLC but facing difficulty with an RX3i PLC. Seeking clarification if the same cable could work for RX3i PLCs, the customer previously used a combination of USB-to-9pin and 9pin-to-15pin cables for connecting to both types of PLCs.

It was assumed that the cables were plugged into the power supply's 15-pin port.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When connecting to an Rx3i PLC, it's important to ensure you are using a reliable serial cable, RS485/232 converter, and USB/serial converter. If your customer is having trouble connecting, there could be a few reasons for this. The port on the Rx3i may be faulty or configured for different settings or protocols than what is needed for communication.

One key question to ask is what is connected to the other end of the cable. If it's a computer with Proficy Machine Edition, make sure the correct COM port is selected for communication. If using a non-GE HMI, it likely utilizes SNPx for serial communications, which the Rx3i doesn't support.</p>

            <p>It is true that the same cable should work with any of the 15 pin RS-485 ports in a GE A&C PLC/PAC, as long as there is no protocol or parameter mismatch. The RX3i CPUs with 15 pin RS-485 ports also have 9 pin RS-232 ports that can work with a 9-pin straight through cable when properly configured. The RX3i primarily utilizes Ethernet for communication, with serial ports included for backward compatibility. Keep in mind that results may vary.</p>

            <p>If you're wondering which Rx3i CPU model you're using, it's important to note that the COM port settings in PME take precedence over Windows settings. This means there's no need to worry about matching the settings in Device Manager with those in PME. The default baud rate for the port in the Rx3i is set at 19200. Have you experimented with this setting in PME yet?</p>

            <p>The 90-30 CPU, not an Rx3i, does not have a serial port, so communication must go through the port on the power supply module. If you have successfully used the cable assembly for communication with other PLCs before, the issue may lie with the power supply module. Consider trying a different power supply module, keeping in mind that the memory backup battery is located on this module. Have the new power supply ready for installation when removing the old one from the rack. Note that the CPU module's capacitor can only retain memory for a brief period on its own.</p>

It's important to understand the difference between an IC694PWRxxx and an IC693PWRxxx. To troubleshoot, check for 5VDC between pins 5 and 7 on the 15-pin port of the power supply module. This voltage is necessary to power the RS232/RS485 converter.</p>
