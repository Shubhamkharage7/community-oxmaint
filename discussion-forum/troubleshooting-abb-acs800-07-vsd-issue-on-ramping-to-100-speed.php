                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am seeking assistance with a current issue I am facing concerning an ABB drive. The problem I am encountering is that the ABB drive supplying power to a large fan is unable to reach 100% speed without tripping due to supply loss, even though there is no fault indication. I have two drives operating the exact same spec fans, but I only experience issues with one drive when it has been inactive for extended periods. When ramping from 98-100% speed, the drive will trip. I have attempted various solutions such as code traps, reaching out to ABB service support, and changing hardware. Occasionally, the drive will inconsistently reach 100% speed, but once it does, it remains stable until the next maintenance outage. Currently, I am running the drive at 98% after the maintenance period. I am seeking expert assistance to address this persistent issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the system did not function properly, running at 95% for 24 hours before attempting to ramp up to 100%, but encountering the same issue. It is indeed a peculiar situation, with no response from the ABB service team.</p>

            <p>Can you provide additional information such as the VFD's nominal power, nominal input voltage, power supply type (direct to grid/transformer, etc), and acceleration ramp time? What is the motor's nominal power and nominal speed? In what scenarios does the VFD decrease output voltage without notification, particularly when attempting to exceed 95% of the nominal motor speed, maximum reference frequency set on the VFD, or another speed parameter?</p>

            <p>If your centrifugal fan is experiencing power loss, it is likely due to a drop in its power supply. As fan speed increases by just 2%, the drive will require significantly more power. For a detailed explanation, refer to the Third Fan Law found in the link below: Understanding the Basic Fan Laws - Axair Fans. Gain insight into pressure, power, and air volume with our practical examples. Visit our website for more information. Remember to monitor supply voltage across the fan speed spectrum.</p>

</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Why does the drive inconsistently reach 100% speed and remain stable after doing so?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The intermittent success in reaching and maintaining 100% speed could be due to various factors, such as temporary improvements in power supply conditions or other external influences. It's important to investigate these instances further to identify the root cause.</p>
