                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently conducting performance testing on oil and gas pumps. I am seeking suggestions for fast-connect pressure gauges for suction and discharge lines, as well as guidance on selecting them from reputable sellers or websites. I am interested in digital gauges that are intrinsically safe, which I can install in place of the client's analog gauges. Additionally, I would appreciate recommendations on how to regularly calibrate the gauges. Since I travel between sites, I am in need of a lightweight set that meets my requirements. Thank you for your assistance.</p>
