            <p>To initiate the conversation, I would like to discuss a few proactive strategies for improving lubrication practices. One key proactive measure is enhancing oil cleanliness, which can lead to improved wear and reliability. This can be achieved by setting ambitious cleanliness goals, communicating them clearly, and equipping plant personnel with the necessary tools and training to make a difference. Monitoring the cleanliness of essential lubrication reservoirs can result in reduced wear and increased reliability by eliminating contaminants that cause damage to bearings.

Additionally, tracking oil consumption can provide insights into current leak rates. By regularly monitoring the amount of new oil purchased, it is possible to identify and address oil leaks. Implementing proactive measures such as proper reservoir ventilation, maintaining the correct oil level, and ensuring proper seal installation can help reduce leaks.

I encourage other experts to share their insights on similar proactive approaches such as vibration and infrared technologies. Rich Wurzbach CLS, LLA MRG Power Labs.</p>

            <p>Maintenance indicators and key performance indicators (KPIs) can vary significantly across different industries, depending on the specific issues faced by equipment. It is crucial to choose the appropriate maintenance metrics tailored to the challenges each plant is experiencing. Here are some recommendations: 

1) For equipment prone to breakdowns and repairs, focus on metrics such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), Breakdown Occurrence (BDO), and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). 
2) For equipment that requires frequent conversion or setup, consider using Mean Time To Set Up (MTTS). 
3) If equipment experiences short stops or errors, also known as "chokotei" in Japanese, track Mean Time Between Assists (MTBA). 
4) For plants with high lubrication consumption, monitor the cost of lubrication, failure rates attributed to lubrication issues, and follow expert recommendations on lubrication practices. 
5) Common plant indices include Utilization, Availability, Cost, Repair and Maintenance (RNM) cost. 

Every plant has its own unique way of measuring performance indicators, particularly in maintenance. This is influenced by the specific challenges each plant faces, as downtime is not solely caused by breakdowns, especially in manufacturing and semiconductor plants.

            <p>I recommend selecting a top-performing Performance Indicator (PI) that measures the percentage of work orders categorized as "Rework" for further planning and analysis. This actionable data can provide valuable insights for optimizing processes and improving overall efficiency.</p>
