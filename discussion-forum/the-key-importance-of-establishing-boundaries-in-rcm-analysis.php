            <p>Terry emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries in the RCM process for two main reasons. Firstly, boundaries help maintain control and organization, especially when multiple groups are involved in the process. Without boundaries, there is a risk of overlap and redundancy in maintenance tasks. Secondly, boundaries ensure a holistic systems perspective is maintained during the review process. This prevents focusing solely on individual components and missing critical system interactions. Terry mentions reading a book on this topic and plans to share further insights via email. Howard</p>

            <p>Terry, In addition to Howard's insights, a key challenge in initiating an analysis is establishing clear boundaries. It is crucial for a skilled analyst to lead this process to ensure the project does not fall into two common pitfalls: being overly broad and inclusive, leading to irrelevant analyses and potential inaccuracies; or being overly detailed and focused on individual assets without considering the larger context. When undertaking a large-scale project, there is a risk of getting bogged down in minutiae, which can result in analysis paralysis. Determining the appropriate level of analysis requires experience and judgment, which professionals develop over time. While there are guidelines available, ultimately, it comes down to the expertise of the RCM analyst themselves.</p>

            <p>Appreciation to Daryl and Howard for their insight. In their work on Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), they concentrated on aircraft systems with clearly delineated and universally applicable boundaries, irrespective of the aircraft manufacturer. In contrast, industrial systems often have fuzzier boundaries that are more arbitrary. Could we not just examine each component within a system or subsystem to ensure all potential failure modes are identified? This approach may be more effective in capturing all possible issues. - Terry O</p>

            <p>Incorporating input from Howard and Darryl... When setting boundaries for conducting a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) analysis using the traditional approach, it is important to consider the time required. A skilled facilitator/analyst should make an educated guess on the number of failure modes to be reviewed within a specific system, taking into account the equipment, components, and past performance. It is recommended to allocate approximately 4-7 minutes per failure mode during the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) phase, depending on the team's level of experience. By establishing the frequency and duration of RCM analysis meetings, you can estimate the number of sessions needed. Overloading the boundaries may prolong the analysis unnecessarily (potentially leading to loss of focus and dedication) or result in an inaccurate outcome. We are preparing to initiate a fresh RCM analysis in two weeks, with a plan for 12 three-hour sessions to address an anticipated 150 failure modes. Communicating the time commitment expectations upfront to team members (and their superiors) can help set clear expectations. The system boundaries were defined to align with functional requirements while ensuring a feasible analysis timeframe.</p>

            <p>Terrence, asked why we can't analyze each component within a system or subsystem to detect all possible failure modes. A paradigm shift introduced by N&H suggests focusing on the functions of an asset rather than its physical characteristics. For instance, a pumping system is viewed as a black box that delivers a specific flow rate at a designated pressure with a set power input. The black box operates based on inputs like process fluids and power, while adhering to constraints such as industry regulations and control systems. Physical assets like pumps and motors are essential for meeting performance standards like pressure, flow, and power consumption. By defining the boundaries of the black-box system, we can clarify our goals and prevent overlaps or missing components in our analysis. It is crucial to distinguish between duty and standby pumps, recognizing that their maintenance requirements are influenced by the consequences of failure. The maintenance workload can be significantly reduced by appropriately addressing the maintenance needs of each pump based on its operating context. Ultimately, focusing on functions rather than components can lead to a more efficient and cost-effective maintenance strategy.</p>

            <p>Neil Bloom, author of Reliability Centered Maintenance, emphasizes the importance of focusing on component functional failure and its impact on overall system performance. Contrary to popular belief, establishing functions at the system and subsystem levels is not a necessary step in the RCM process and may even hinder the accuracy of the analysis. It is crucial to adhere to community standards and respect rules when discussing these concepts. Don't miss the chance to meet Neil Bloom at RCM-2006 in Las Vegas, where he will share his unique insights from his experience in the commercial aviation and nuclear plant industries. Be sure to grab a copy of his book for more innovative ideas. Let's validate these concepts together. - Terry O</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When implementing ISO 14224, it is important to establish clear Equipment boundaries for effective data collection. While a single train Gas Compressor may serve as its own 'System', it is generally recommended to define system boundaries for RCM studies. The failure modes outlined in ISO 14224 align with 'Functional Failures' in RCM, such as 'failed to start' or 'stopped while running'. To identify specific failure modes, like Motor Starter open circuit or Coupling sheared, it is necessary to delve deeper than the functional failures. Relying solely on standards, software, or databases may not always be the best approach. Define your objectives first, then determine the most suitable source for your needs.</p>

            <p>When working in a complex industrial system with flexible boundaries, it might be beneficial to analyze each component individually rather than focusing on the overall system or subsystem. By taking a component-based approach, you can potentially identify all failure modes. Functions can be assessed effectively at both the component and process levels. While it may not be perfect within the system's operational context, it can still be highly reliable. It's important to distinguish between all failure modes and reasonable failure modes based on the specific operating conditions. However, conducting this level of analysis on a large scale can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. It's essential to consider the scalability of the approach and how it can be efficiently implemented across a wide asset base. Taking a step back to look at the bigger picture will help ensure the analysis is effective and manageable.</p>

            <p>Hello Daryl, I have a question regarding defining boundaries and focusing on systems. Do we need to assess every component with a potential for failure, even if we have clearly defined boundaries? I am puzzled as to why some RCM analyses struggle with defining boundaries when it seems simple to mark them on a blueprint or schematic. While I may be exaggerating, I am surprised that my questioning of traditional RCM techniques did not receive more pushback. Perhaps we should consider simplifying the process of boundary setting. Considering the workload involved, my revised question is: How crucial is it to accurately establish boundaries in RCM analysis? Thank you for your insights. Terry O</p>

            <p>When conducting a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) analysis, it is not necessary to define every potential failure mode of each component. Instead, focus on failures that are likely to result in the loss of function. RCM can be applied at various levels, but I believe performing it at a system or process level is most effective. Consider the complexity of the system being analyzed when determining the appropriate level for RCM. For example, in a wastewater plant screening system, it may be beneficial to separate the wash water system and conveying/removal system for individual analysis due to their complexity. Balancing flexibility and rigor is crucial for a successful RCM analysis. While analyzing equipment or component levels may be necessary for critical assets like a 400KV transformer, it is important to avoid unnecessary analyses that can lead to loss of focus and accuracy. Ultimately, the goal for RCM should be to be comprehensive and resource-efficient without compromising on quality. These suggestions may help address the issues you have raised, and I am looking forward to discussing more about functions in the future.</p>

            <p>Adding onto Daryl's insights: The NAVSEA MIL-P process takes a comprehensive approach when analyzing systems, such as the HVAC system on a vessel. Within this defined system, there are 'functionally significant items' that require detailed analysis, like the fan motor or compressor. I have found that addressing the entire system is more effective than focusing solely on individual components. For example, analyzing a vertical AC motor can be intricate, while a parallel pumping system with VFD's offers a more straightforward perspective. It is worth noting, as Terry mentioned, that wastewater plant screens are classified as hidden functions by some, contrary to Daryl's perspective. - Howard</p>

While it's true that they may not always protect against abnormal conditions, they still play a significant role in maintaining smooth operations. Josh, the number of levels in a system can vary widely, with more or less than the typical 9 levels. It's important to remember that levels are not set in stone and can fluctuate depending on the circumstances.</p>

            <p>In discussions regarding asset management, it is crucial to establish boundaries to avoid wasteful overlap or duplication in studies. The level of detail in a study significantly impacts costs, making it essential to assess whether the expenses justify the depth of the analysis. For instance, when conducting a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) study for a vehicle, considerations such as the cost of spare parts and labor can influence decision-making on addressing failure modes. It is important to prioritize credible failure modes and avoid unnecessary fishing expeditions. While there are guidelines on distinguishing between evident and hidden functions, the level of analysis in RCM should align with the level of part/assembly replacement. Although there may be reasons to delve deeper, such decisions should be thoroughly scrutinized and approved beforehand.</p>

            <p>In order to enhance reliability and reduce unscheduled downtime, it is important to focus on specific components of a paper machine rather than the whole machine itself. For instance, imagine a scenario where a plant has multiple paper machines of similar type and size that produce tissue. Would you take a divide and conquer approach when implementing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) on these machines, or would you try to tackle the entire machine at once? It is crucial to carefully delineate boundaries and prioritize maintenance tasks in order to effectively improve the reliability of each paper machine.</p>

            <p>I am a bit unclear about the scope of this conversation. When determining boundaries, I always ensure that the flows supporting the system (such as labor, energy, water, gas, materials, compressed air, etc.) are both qualitatively and quantitatively secure. Establishing physical boundaries then becomes straightforward. When it comes to specifics, do we agree that we should limit our analysis to the Lower Replaceable Unit (LRU) level? This may vary depending on the situation. For example, if your company does not repair electric motors when they fail (due to lack of expertise or cost reasons), it makes sense to stop at the motor level. Otherwise, delving deeper into details would be necessary. This is my usual approach. Is this correct? Thank you. Rui</p>

            <p>Have you heard of ISO14224 and its guidelines on defining functional boundaries for major equipment types in the oil and gas industry? This concept can also be extended to other equipment types. For example, ISO14224 outlines separate boundaries for a compressor and its driver. However, when it comes to implementing RCM and CMMS systems, it is more practical to consider the overall functional boundary, which includes both the compressor and its driver. This approach ensures a comprehensive and efficient maintenance strategy for all equipment types.</p>

            <p>Just so you know, the API has updated the ISO version of the standard to now encompass both offshore and downstream oil and gas equipment. This means that in addition to offshore equipment, the API standard also includes equipment for refineries and gas plants. It is advisable to obtain the API version of the standard, as it can easily be found online through a quick search.</p>

Although it had less information compared to the 2004 version, it still proved valuable. Moving forward, I will make sure to keep track of all norms related to reliability, especially RCM. I also began to question if there was indeed a 2004 version, or if it was just a draft that was finalized in 2006. Can anyone confirm this? Thank you. - Rui</p>
