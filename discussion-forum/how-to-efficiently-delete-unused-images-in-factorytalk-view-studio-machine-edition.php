                    <p>Does anyone have a tool or technique for deleting unused images in FactoryTalk View Studio Machine Edition? Our client provided a template with no text on the HMI, resulting in numerous unnecessary images. I need to identify and remove around 40 of these images. One possible solution I am considering is exporting all displays to XML, creating a table of image names, and cross-referencing it with the Images folder in the workspace. This method would allow me to systematically delete unused images. I'm interested in hearing if anyone has a more efficient approach to this task.</p>

            <p>Hello jholm90, I would like to know how to "export all displays to XML". While I am fine with deleting images individually by right-clicking on them and selecting "Delete" in the Graphics/Images section of Explorer, I am unsure how to identify which images are currently in use. If I attempt to delete an image that is being utilized, will FTV prevent me from doing so? Your assistance is appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>To efficiently manage images in FactoryTalk Studio, start by right-clicking on the displays/graphics folder in the tree and selecting the export option. On the next page, ensure to select all images for export. I have developed a script that automatically opens each file and compiles a comprehensive list of images used in each display. By merging these lists, a unique images list is generated. Next, carefully review this list to identify and delete any unnecessary images in FactoryTalk Studio that are not included in the script-generated list.

It is crucial to note that deleting an image that is in use will result in an error state, indicated by an X mark. Consequently, FactoryTalk Studio does not provide any alerts when attempting to delete a used image. This approach ensures a streamlined process for managing and optimizing image resources in FactoryTalk Studio.</p>

            <p>jholm90 advised: To begin, right-click on the displays/graphics folder in the tree and choose the export option. On the subsequent page, ensure to select all items. I have developed a script that automates the process of opening all files and compiling a list of images utilized in each display. This consolidated list of images from all displays is then created. I carefully review each image on this list and remove any that are not included in the list generated by my script. Keep in mind that if you delete an image that is in use, it will be marked with an X in the error state. It is important to note that FactoryTalk Studio does not provide a warning when attempting to delete an image that is being utilized. Feel free to share your script with us.</p>
