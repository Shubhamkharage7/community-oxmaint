                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>| Check out the attached photos of a recent bearing failure on a grinding/classifying mill. Upon disassembling the bearing assembly hub, it was clear why the mill had stopped working. However, I am seeking to understand the root cause of the bearing failure depicted in the images. The hub comprises three bearings: two nu316 cylindrical roller bearings and one qj316 deep groove ball bearing with a split inner race. The hub is situated vertically, with one bearing at the top and two at the pulley end, with the ball bearing at the bottom. The mill runs at a speed of 2600rpm and is powered by a 75kw belt-driven motor. It appears that the outer race has been rotating within the housing, potentially due to previous sleeving, causing the ball bearings to impact the inner race and generate enough heat to deform it. Any insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, we had accelerometers attached to the bearing housing and took readings three days prior to the failure, which did not show any defects or increased stress levels. What could have led to such rapid bearing failure? ------------------------------ James Peters ------------------------------</p>

            <p>The damage observed on the split inner race bearing could be attributed to axial movement of the shaft. Correct orientation of the split races would suggest significant in/out movement of at least .250 inches, resulting in dents on both bearing races. The off-center ball path on the outer race indicates misalignment, causing the balls to not ride properly. This issue may be due to cheap bearings that were inadequately heat treated, leading to metal deformation under overload conditions. The elongated holes in the cage, which hold the balls, further confirm the in/out movement. Bearing failure on a grinding/classifying mill was recently experienced, with potential causes identified in the housing allowing the outer race to spin, impacting the inner race and generating heat-induced deformation. Accelerometer readings taken prior to the failure did not show any defects or increased stress levels. This rapid bearing failure raises questions on the root cause and the need for further investigation. For quality bearings and reliable solutions, visit www.midlandsrc.com.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Dave, for your valuable insights on bearing defects. Your expertise in this field is greatly appreciated, as I was unsure about what I was seeing. Your input will help pinpoint the root cause of the issue and explore possible solutions. 

It appears that the bearing failure on the grinding/classifying mill was caused by the spinning outer race inside the housing, leading to the ball bearings impacting the inner race and generating excessive heat. Despite having accelerometers attached to the bearing housing, no defects or increased stress levels were detected prior to the failure.

This incident raises the question of what could lead to such rapid bearing failure. Any additional thoughts or insights on this matter would be welcomed. Your knowledge and experience are truly invaluable in addressing and resolving this issue effectively.

Sincerely,
James Peters</p>
