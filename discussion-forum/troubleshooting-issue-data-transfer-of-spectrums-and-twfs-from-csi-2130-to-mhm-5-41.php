                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am currently facing a perplexing issue and urgently seeking a solution. Our organization utilizes separate rbm databases for different regions. However, we are encountering a strange problem with a specific database. When we transfer data from CSI 2130 to Machinery Health Manager, only the overall trend is being transferred, rather than the spectrums and Time wave forms. This is a new issue for us, and despite conducting thorough checks, we have not been able to resolve it. 

We have confirmed the following: 
1. The Route Summary in Route Management indicates that waveform and spectra storage settings are correct. 
2. We can view the collected data (Spectrums and TWFs) in CSI 2130. 
3. There are no bad data flags on the points in the 2130 device. 
4. Data dump settings in Data Transfer are configured to store everything and save bad data. We have also scanned for errors using the database utility program, which returned no issues.

Despite attempting data transfer with different collectors, the outcome remains consistent. Given that we do not have support from CSI, our options for assistance are limited. We are currently using MHM version 5.41. Any prompt suggestions on how to address this issue would be greatly valued. Thank you in advance for your input.

Warm regards,
Bala K</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I am excited to share that the issue has been successfully resolved. The database size had exceeded 2GB, causing it to no longer accept new data. By removing some old data, we were able to resolve the issue and upload all the necessary information. Best regards, Bala K.</p>
