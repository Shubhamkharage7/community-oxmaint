                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am seeking advice on how to achieve a specific task related to customers' requirements for an analogue output (0 - 5V) with adjustable output and ramp time controlled by a recipe system. The challenge is that the output may not always start from 0V. For instance, one recipe may begin with a valve set at a pilot flow rate of 0.5V, which then needs to ramp up to the full flow rate of 4.5V over a specified time period. However, these values vary depending on the selected recipe.

I am struggling to figure out how to dynamically calculate the difference in output values and ramp time for each recipe. I initially attempted to calculate the difference between the two flow rates, divide it by the ramp time, and use timers and counters to increment the output value. However, I feel this approach may be overly complex and exceeding my PLC programming knowledge.

The equipment being used includes an FX5UC PLC and FX5-4DA analogue output card, along with GX Works 3 and GT Designer software. The variables involved in the recipes are the pilot flow rate, full flow rate, and ramp time.

Any guidance or solutions on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>An important step is to accurately scale the raw data into a meaningful range, such as 0-100% or 0-100 ltrs/s, before proceeding with the recipe calculations. Utilize the recipe's start and end variables, as well as the time in seconds, to ensure accurate results. Let's consider a scenario where we are using a % scale from 0.0 to 100.0%. The recipe parameters are as follows: Start % = 20.5, End % = 100.0, Time = 6 seconds. 

To execute the recipe, set the analogue variable to the recipe start value, which is 20.5 in this case. Calculate the difference between the start and end values, which equals 79.5. Divide this by the time duration of 6.0 seconds to determine the ramp rate (using floating-point calculations is recommended). 

If needed, you can convert the time into tenths of seconds. IEC timers measure time in multiples of 10ms or 100ms, with conversion functions available to convert integers to time values. Depending on your specific requirements, you may choose to increment the value every second or every tenth of a second. For further exploration of this concept using GXworks3 on an FX5 controller, stay tuned for future updates.</p>

            <p>Are there specific voltage levels the system will reach, such as a range from 2v to 4v or 1v to 4.5v, or will it always max out at 5v? I have experience with analog signals on FX3 but need to see if FX5 analog signals have scaling parameters or if adjustments need to be made in the PLC code. One potential solution could be dividing the range from 20% to 60% into 100ms intervals, resulting in increments of 0.4% every 10th of a second. For even finer adjustments, a 10ms interval could be considered.</p>

            <p>The full output range may vary, starting at 1v and increasing to 4.5v, rather than always going from minimum to maximum. The ramp rate is the rate at which the output changes over time, with a somewhat linear progression but with stepping increments at each time point. A 10ms time base allows for finer control. The analogue output card can be configured in either direction, currently set at 0 - 5V / 0 - 32000 digitally, with the option to adjust the 0 - 32000 range as needed.</p>

            <p>I have successfully implemented a system using floating point values ranging from 0-100%. I typically use real units such as liters, percentages, and kilograms as floats, and then utilize a custom scaling block to convert these values back to raw integers. It is necessary to convert integers to real values for calculations and then back to integers for output to the analog system. This system is designed with a 100ms increment, providing a smooth and responsive outcome. I carried out this project using an FX3U in GXWorks2, but it can easily be adapted for FX5 as the functions are similar. In the future, I may attempt to replicate this in FX5 using integers. Please note that I have used decimal points for time measurements (e.g. 0.0 to x.x minutes), but using whole minutes can simplify the process. Adding seconds to the calculation may require slightly more processing power.</p>

            <p>When working with HMI Recipe data types, it is important to understand the formatting, such as whether they are decimal numbers or integers. Will the data include times in formats like 6 minutes 20 seconds, or will it be in whole minutes? Additionally, consider the analog start and end values on the HMI—will they range from 0.0 to 100.0%, or will they be whole numbers like 100 or 32000? The specific values will depend on the fields being used. Understanding these details will ensure smooth operation and accurate data representation in your HMI system.</p>

            <p>Impressive! This method seems much more efficient than my previous approach. I'm eager to try it in GX Works 3 and see the results. I already have scaling blocks ready to convert to floating point, so I will use them as you suggested. Let me give you a more detailed overview.

I have set up the HMI recipe system with four different adjustable parameters. Firstly, the flow rate for valve 1 ranges from 0.0 to 40.0 and is transmitted from the HMI (GOT 2507) to the PLC as a Real (32-bit) value. Secondly, Valve 2 is configured as a ratio of valve 1 setpoint, limited from 0.0 to 0.9, also in Real (32-bit) format. Thirdly, the ramp time is set between 0.0 to 10.0 seconds, and lastly, the dwell time ranges from 0.0 to 60.0 seconds, both in Real (32-bit) values.

The HMI does not need to display the analog settings for the valve output flow rates, as the valves have built-in flow meters. The valves provide feedback as another analog input (0-5v) which is then displayed on the screen. The PLC simply controls the flow rate of the valve through a 0-5v analog output, and the valve sends back the flow rate as a 0-5v analog input. This information is displayed on the HMI and can also be monitored in the PLC.

I truly appreciate all the help you have provided thus far.</p>

            <p>Apologies for the confusion in my previous comments, I mistakenly calculated based on minutes instead of seconds. Since you are working with tenths of seconds, 100ms equates to a tenth of a second according to my reciprocating timer calculations. Thank you for pointing out the error.</p>

            <p>I recently tested it on the FX5 platform and encountered some challenges due to my unfamiliarity with the IDE. Despite this, I was able to make it function correctly. However, I noticed a slight error when inputting a range of 10.0 to 40.0 and a time of 4 seconds. The output reached 31980, which is close to 32000. This discrepancy could be attributed to float accuracy or possibly the use of a 100ms timer, which are known to have slight inaccuracies.</p>

            <p>Hello Parky,

I wanted to thank you for your assistance yesterday. I was able to make my system work by adjusting the time setpoint multiplier by 10. I encountered the same error as you, which seems to be caused by trying to divide by 0. To address this issue, I decided to postpone any calculations until the recipe items have been uploaded by the HMI or after the initial boot up.

Similar to your experience, the final outcome seems to have slight variations. However, for this specific application, the level of accuracy achieved is more than satisfactory. Thank you once again for your valuable support.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>It is important to be mindful of dividing by zero when working on this project. Initially, I tackled this issue in a Free Body Diagram (FBD) but later found a different approach using a ladder diagram. I considered using Structured Text (ST) as well, but was unsure if you were familiar with that. Additionally, I implemented a safeguard to prevent the final value from exceeding the maximum limit. For instance, if the setpoint is 40.0 and the actual value reaches 40.345, I adjust it to the maximum limit. Furthermore, I convert the value to an integer and scale it to a range of 0-32000 to drive the analog signal. I suspect that the error lies in the precision of the floating point numbers, as it accumulates over iterations.</p>

            <p>I have extensive experience working with ladder logic, starting with commissioning systems using old AB SLC-500 PLCs. I only recently began using Function Block (FB) programming when we started using FX5 PLCs and GX Works 3, and I found it to be a more user-friendly option. Structured Text (ST) is not something I am familiar with, so I would need guidance to work with it.

I will be incorporating your maximum check logic into the system since I have observed the output exceeding the 5V limit. Without physical valves in place during bench testing, it is uncertain how the valve will respond to anything above 5V, hence it's best to set a limit. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>To be transparent, the difference is minimal, less than 2%. For instance, comparing 32,000 to 32,450 is a very small variation. In terms of voltage calculations, 32,000 divided by 5.0 equals 6,400 per volt. A hundredth of a volt is 640, which means the impact is likely insignificant. While there is a RAMP function available in the FX5, it needs to be incorporated into a timed interrupt like a 100ms program. This involves setting parameters such as the total value to ramp up to and the number of calls to ramp.</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity, I implemented the RAMP function within an interrupt and it performed flawlessly. I calculated the required ramp time in 100ms increments and converted the actual minimum and maximum values by multiplying them by 800, resulting in a range of 0-32000. When I called the RAMP function within the interrupt every 100ms, it consistently produced accurate results and resulted in a more efficient code. However, when attempting to replicate the process in FBD, I encountered a bug in the simulator that prevented the interrupt from being processed smoothly.</p>

            <p>I attempted to use the RAMP function in GXWorks 3 for my PLC programming, but I struggled to make it work effectively in simulation mode. After consulting the help files, I found that adjusting the scan time was recommended as a potential solution. This was a new concept for me and I was uncertain about making changes to it. Unfortunately, I did not have access to the control panel at that time to test it on an actual PLC, which made troubleshooting more challenging.</p>

            <p>Initially, I encountered the same issue where I wrote the block to be called in ladder (just the RAMPF). After experimenting with the interrupts, I was able to get it to work. However, when I tried to write it in FBD, I faced difficulties. I vaguely recall reading in a document that interrupt programs should be in ladder format. Additionally, there was an issue with converting floats to integers within the interrupt block - it wouldn't compile, unlike in a normal scan block where it did compile. It seems there are some bugs in the GXW3 simulator, as I haven't experienced this problem in GXW2. I will attempt to make it work in ladder, but incorporate the rest in FBD. This could be due to FBD using jumps to subroutines instead of straightforward ladder processing. When FBD blocks are called, they jump to a subroutine and then return. However, using this in an interrupt block may cause it to jump out of the interrupt to a subroutine and then return, potentially leading to interruptions that should be avoided.</p>

            <p>If you are encountering issues with using the RAMPF function in interrupts or fixed scans, it may be due to limitations in the simulation environment. To address this, I have developed a function block that effectively calls the RampF function and passes the necessary parameters. This approach has proven successful, with no overflow occurring when the desired output is reached. It is important to note that the ramp time can be specified in seconds or 100ms pulses - for example, 5.0 seconds equates to 50 ramp pulses. If you prefer to work with minutes instead of pulses, simply adjust the multiplication factor to 60. Keep in mind that the output of the RAMPF function is an array containing 2 integers, which should be referenced as Raw_out[0] and Raw_out[1]. Raw_out[0] represents the actual ramp value, while Raw_out[1] indicates the number of scans completed.</p>

            <p>Wow, it never occurred to me to consider the possibility that the simulator could be causing issues while testing my original software with the RAMPF function block. I had simply assumed the problem was with my programming. Thank you for pointing that out.</p>

            <p>I am not familiar with limitations, but Analogues, special cards, and fast I/O features like PWM and encoders (which have hardware counters linked to inputs X0-7) may cause interruptions to not function properly. By creating a function block and running it with the 100ms special bit SM410, it is similar to running it in a 100ms interrupt or event block. However, the simulator for GXDev and GXWorks2 indicates that functions are restricted. Although the manual for GXSim3 is not available, GXDev Sim does not support around 60 functions.</p>

            <p>Interrupts were not working during the event on the simulator because I forgot to enable them. When using the RAMPF function within an interrupt, there are a few steps to follow for successful operation: 1. Enable interrupts and set TRUE EI in the main program block. 2. Create a separate program file and call the RAMPF function, ensuring that the EN bit initiates the ramping process. 3. Reset the EN bit once the output (Array[0]) reaches or exceeds the maximum value. Remember to reset Array[0] to 0 after the process is complete. 4. Move the program with RAMPF to the fixed scan task and set the interrupt to I28 (100ms) in the program settings. This should resolve the issue. Why not give it a try on the simulator?</p>
