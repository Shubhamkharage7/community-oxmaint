                    <p>Hello, a client I work with has a Weinview MT8121iE HMI. I successfully uploaded the source code using Easy Builder Pro 6.02, but encountered difficulty when trying to download it again as the HMI was not supported by EasyBuilderPro. After researching online, I discovered that the HMI can be programmed using EasyBuilderPro V4.00.11 and higher versions. I have experimented with various versions of EasyBuilder, but none seem to cater to the MT8121ie model. If anyone can provide insight on which program I should use, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Greetings! If you're looking to learn more about Weinview HMI series, check out this informative FAQ page on NVCNC's website: https://www.nvcnc.net/mt8000-faq.html. You can also download projects using a USB cable by following the instructions in FAQ_29_How_to_install_USB_driver_of_HMI_i_series. Even if you're more familiar with the MT81**iE and xE series, this information could prove to be helpful. After giving it a try, feel free to share your results with us.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your response, although it was not helpful. I have discovered a solution that I would like to share. The HMI mentioned is specifically designed for the Chinese market and is compatible with Easy Builder Pro versions installed in Chinese. By switching the language settings to Chinese, the HMI will appear in the menu.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If you are using a Chinese market Weinview HMI that is not compatible with Easybuilder Pro, make sure to download the Weinview version of the software from their official website Weinview.cn. This version, although in English, has a different list of HMIs specifically designed for the Chinese market. It seems that this is done to region lock the HMIs. Keep in mind that while this workaround has been successful with some HMIs, such as the all-in-one models, there may be compatibility issues with the headless FHDX series. If you are planning to purchase a 520 or 920 model for use outside of Asia, exercise caution as it may not work seamlessly. Stay tuned for updates on how to potentially solve this issue with the FHDX series.</p>
