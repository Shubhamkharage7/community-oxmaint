        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Welcome to the forum! You've asked a great first query that delves into the world of Modbus. As a newbie to Modbus, it's common to have some inconsistencies in your question, making it a bit challenging to provide a definitive answer. However, I can start by making a few general statements.

Typically, in a Modbus communication setup, a Modbus Master (Client) device initiates a read or write request to a Modbus Slave (Server) device. The Slave then responds with data values for a read request or confirms success or failure for a write request. While there are other types of requests, reads and writes are the most common.

If a device, other than the CompactLogix, holds the data values, it would act as the Slave/Server. The CompactLogix, in this scenario, would be the Master/Client device that initiates the requests for data, to which the Slave/Server device responds.

On the other hand, if the CompactLogix holds the data values, it would function as the Slave/Server device. The other device in this case would be the Master/Client device that makes requests and receives responses from the Slave/Server device.

In a Modbus communication, the maximum number of 16-bit registers that can be read in a single request/response pair is 125. To retrieve 1024 INTs (16-bit signed integers), you would need at least nine requests - eight with 125 registers each and one with 24 registers (assuming the register values are contiguous).

Now, let's focus on untangling the details of your query. The thread title mentions "Rockwell TCP Server AOI," suggesting that the CompactLogix may be the server. However, your mention of "Modbus register addresses coming from a device" hints that the other device might be the server.

It's essential to clarify which device holds the values at addresses 33000 and above. Modbus register addresses do not originate from a device; instead, the values at those addresses are maintained by a Slave device. This distinction is crucial for understanding your needs effectively.

You mentioned writing values to an array of 16-bit INTs, likely referring to either Input Registers or Holding Registers on the Slave device. Considering Modbus protocol constraints, it's safe to assume you are referring to Holding Registers since Input Registers cannot be written to.

Address "33000" poses some ambiguity, as it could refer to different offsets within the Slave's registers. Clear communication about the specific devices involved and the communication medium (RTU or TCP) will streamline the resolution process for your Modbus setup.</p>

            <p>In response to @drbitboy's comment, I want to emphasize that the addresses fall within the range of 33000 and are of type INT[1024], indicating 1024 registers likely starting at address 33000. The range, therefore, spans from 33000 to 34023. If you do not require all data points, you can selectively read or write the registers that are necessary. For instance, if you only need registers 5-10, you would only need to access registers 33004-33009 (or 33005-33010 depending on whether it's 0 or 1 based). Another consideration is verifying the byte order despite the registers being 16-bit INTs, so conducting tests to confirm the low and high order bytes is essential. Additionally, double-checking the 0 vs 1 based address system may cause confusion, but can be resolved by testing consecutive registers with known data. Good luck on your journey!</p>

            <p>drbitboy's welcome to the forum was accompanied by insightful advice on navigating the complexities of Modbus communication. Understanding the roles of Modbus Master (Client) and Modbus Slave (Server) devices is crucial for successful data exchange. Typically, the Master device initiates read/write requests, to which the Slave device responds accordingly. 

In the context of a CompactLogix system, determining whether it acts as the Master or the Slave device is essential. The maximum number of 16-bit registers that can be read in a single Modbus request/response pair is limited to 125. For larger data sets, multiple requests may be necessary.

Clarifying the device roles and identifying the Modbus register addresses are key steps in setting up communication. By defining the Modbus Client and Server devices and selecting the appropriate communication protocol (TCP/IP), seamless data transmission can be achieved.

Understanding the significance of register addresses, function codes, and transaction types is essential for proper Modbus communication. With a clear understanding of these concepts, users can avoid common pitfalls and ensure smooth data exchange.

In conclusion, mastering the intricacies of Modbus communication, defining device roles, and selecting appropriate settings are vital for successful data transfer. By sharing insights and lessons learned, users can navigate Modbus challenges with confidence and efficiency.</p>

            <p>In response to @drbitboy's comment, nicherbert suggests that the addresses fall within the range of 33000 and are of type INT[1024]. This indicates that there are 1024 registers, likely starting at address 33000, resulting in a range from 33000 to 34023. If all the data points are not needed, one can simply read/write the necessary registers. For instance, if registers 5-10 are the only ones required, scanning registers 33004-33009 (or 33005-33010 depending on the base) would suffice. It is also advised to scan each register individually.

Furthermore, it is important to verify the byte order despite the registers being INTs (16 bits). Testing should be conducted to confirm the low and high order bytes to ensure the data elements align with expectations. Checking the 0 vs 1 based address is also crucial, but can be rectified by testing two consecutive registers with known data.

Wishing you success on your project journey! Your advice is greatly appreciated, and I will be vigilant for these considerations as I proceed.</p>

            <p>The reason why a 1000ms task may not work is because the default transaction rate is also set at 1000ms. This means that transactions are expected to be completed within 1000ms, leading to possible overlap. With each transaction taking 8 scans, this means each transaction should ideally be set to 8000ms or more to avoid overlap. If there are multiple transactions, they will be executed consecutively, requiring scans to be multiplied by the number of transactions. It is recommended to set the task rate between 10-50ms for optimal performance. For more detailed performance numbers, refer to the manual.</p>

            <p>Idiotsecant posed the question: Is this more of a theoretical exercise or an actual real-world application? If it's the former, keep up the good work. If it's the latter, consider utilizing a dedicated protocol converter card for smoother operation. Prosoft offers a range of protocol converter cards that handle the technicalities without causing frustration for future users.

While Prosoft cards can be a bit perplexing for those unfamiliar with them, there are alternative options worth considering. In my opinion, a Redlion Data Acquisition (DA) device is a more user-friendly choice that also saves space in the chassis, unlike most Prosoft cards. The Redlion DA can handle multiple protocols and additional tasks, making it a versatile solution.

Additionally, having Logix Modbus Add-On Instructions (AOIs) at your disposal proves convenient when Modbus unexpectedly becomes part of the project. Keep in mind that the TCP version may not be compatible with older Compactlogix or Ethernet cards in Controllogix; opt for newer models supporting "Sockets" for seamless integration.</p>
