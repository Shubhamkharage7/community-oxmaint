            <p>The question of efficiency in work order management is not easily answered with a one-size-fits-all solution. The effectiveness of your work order process can vary depending on various factors such as the scope of your operations, the quality of your work order documentation, the setup of your data management system, and the leadership and oversight provided by management. Let's dive deeper into the role of management in optimizing work order efficiency.</p>

            <p>One of the most crucial questions in management is determining production targets. Early in my career, a plant manager mandated this to me without considering all relevant factors. He relied solely on past data from the last 8 years, neglecting the current condition of equipment and the capabilities of my team. This led to unnecessary stress and heartache as I struggled to meet unrealistic goals. It became clear that success depends not just on past performance, but also on the skills and dedication of the current team. In the end, the answer to setting production targets depends on a thorough assessment of all variables at play.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Even plants with the highest uptime goals encounter systems that are designated as RTF. When focusing solely on an RTF system, the planned/unplanned ratio typically hovers around 2% planned and 98% unplanned. It is important to note that some maintenance work may be carried out preemptively before an issue escalates into a breakdown. RTF is not a binary concept, as all systems receive varying levels of planned maintenance depending on their criticality to the overall operation.

Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the ideal planned/unplanned ratio will differ based on the prioritization set by management for individual systems, even in high-uptime plants. While consolidating all work order data into a broad percentage may seem convenient, it may oversimplify the insights and steer decision-making off course.

One common challenge lies in accurately categorizing work orders based on work types. Over time, work types may evolve, leading to shifts in how maintenance tasks are classified. For example, the removal of investigative and condition-based work types from the CMMS resulted in the reclassification of such tasks as corrective maintenance (CM).

The recent introduction of sub-work types provides a more granular view that is essential for distinguishing between planned and unplanned maintenance activities. However, comparing this new data to historical records may prove challenging due to the differences in data categorization, necessitating a fresh start in trend analysis.

While consultants may suggest ideal ratios, these benchmarks may vary and may not necessarily align with your specific circumstances. It is crucial to focus on improving your own data accuracy and trend analysis, as the key to success lies in getting your maintenance data right.</p>

            <p>Check out these excellent insights. I had the privilege of working for a world-renowned company with a top-notch Planning and Scheduling Process that dates back to 1980. Our key metric was achieving 90% of planned work and only 10% unplanned tasks, with a mere 2% of labor hours allocated to emergency situations. Attaining 80% Planned and 90% Scheduled Work by week and day can give your business a significant edge over competitors. To kickstart this process, begin by defining what constitutes a planned job and evaluating how you track work backlog. Consider managing workload based on asset criticality and defect severity to optimize efficiency and performance. For a deeper dive into this topic, I've included a chapter from one of my books that highlights the maintenance practices at the plant I worked at in the 1980s. This chapter, penned by the esteemed Maintenance and Engineering Manager, John Day, provides insights into the real numbers behind our success. If you're interested in visiting the plant, they offer tours of the maintenance department for $1000 per person, with over 500 visitors annually.

            <p>Is Run-to-Failure (RTF) a viable maintenance strategy for planned work? This approach involves allowing equipment to run until it fails, rather than following a proactive maintenance schedule.</p>

            <p>In cases where equipment has redundant components allowing it to be shut down without affecting operations, the run-to-failure approach may be applicable. When a component fails, it can still be addressed on a scheduled basis, such as 12 weeks after the failure. This type of maintenance may be considered corrective rather than preventive, but it can still be planned rather than unplanned. However, if immediate maintenance is necessary due to the equipment failure disrupting planned work schedules, run-to-failure may not be the best strategy. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in maintenance strategy.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the valuable insights shared in this post. It’s straightforward and clear, making it easy to comprehend. However, one common issue I notice with many companies is their reliance on Run to Failure (RTF) as a maintenance strategy without even realizing it. Instead of implementing a proactive PM program, they end up dealing with reactive and unplanned work when equipment fails. RTF seems to be the prevailing maintenance approach in these organizations.</p>

            <p>In certain cases, it is more effective to adopt a run-to-failure (RTF) approach for equipment with a predominant random failure type, such as electronics. While proactive maintenance strategies like cleaning dust out may be beneficial for some equipment, in facilities like data center clean rooms, RTF may be the most practical choice. Despite proactive efforts, many pieces of equipment will ultimately fail regardless. Proactive cleaning can help prolong the lifespan of equipment, but sometimes there are no predictive monitoring conditions for failure. RTF is also suitable for auxiliary building equipment that supports the main production process but is not directly involved in its operation.</p>

            <p>When determining Planned / Unplanned ratios, it is crucial to take into account the time frame involved. For instance, some organizations classify a task as unplanned if it is completed within a week of the initial work order being issued. This time horizon plays a significant role in evaluating and managing planned and unplanned work in a timely manner.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Operating with a strategic approach is crucial for effective maintenance planning. Strategic planning involves considering various aspects in advance, such as scope, sequence, resources, and spare parts. Planned work entails tasks that have been carefully thought out in advance. It's important to determine whether we are in control of the decision-making process or if equipment autonomy is influencing the outcomes. Planned work encompasses scheduled activities like preventive maintenance (PM), predictive maintenance (PdM), and run-to-failure (RTF) tasks conducted based on reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) analysis. This includes detective tasks (failure finding) and corrective actions driven by PdM/CBM insights. Proper organization ensures that a comprehensive work package is delivered by the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). While most planned work is scheduled in advance, some tasks like RTF or condition-based maintenance (CM) arising from PdM analysis may not be. Efforts should still be made to plan these tasks effectively.  
Conversely, there are also unplanned activities for which we have no predetermined plan or schedule. Examples include unexpected breakdowns, trips, or rework post-PM activities. These unplanned tasks are characterized by their spontaneous nature and lack of preparation. The distinction between planned and unplanned work is crucial for optimizing work efficiency. Planned work can be carried out with reduced downtime, manpower, and cost compared to unplanned work, leading to minimal losses. It's essential to focus on reducing total downtime and combined costs of PM and CM activities to make informed decisions. While the CM/PM ratio is a valuable metric, a sole emphasis on this ratio may obscure the overall cost implications. Striving to meet benchmark targets for CM activities without proper evaluation of costs could be counterproductive. Prioritizing CM based on actual need and strategic planning is key to maximizing equipment lifespan and minimizing unnecessary expenses.</p>

            <p>Mr. Slater, I believe my explanation is thorough and clear, not overly complicated. I am capable of summarizing it in just 2 or 3 sentences, but I have chosen to proactively address any potential follow-up queries. In essence, equipment can either stop intentionally (planned) or unintentionally (unplanned). The reasons for intentionally stopping equipment include not needing it, performing preventive maintenance (PM), utilizing condition-based maintenance (CM) data analysis, or accepting negligible potential failure consequences. These intentional stops may or may not be scheduled. Does this explanation suffice?</p>

            <p>Hello Vee, I want to clarify that my intention was not to question the input or motivation of any contributor. The original question was straightforward: "What is the optimal ratio between planned and unplanned maintenance work?" The truth is, there is no one-size-fits-all ratio without considering equipment and economic factors. It's important to keep this in mind. Your points are valid and should not be discounted. 

To illustrate, let me share an example from my experience in maintenance. I have worked in two different types of plants. One plant was straightforward, with basic equipment in a clean environment, resulting in minimal unplanned downtime. On the other hand, the second plant had complex machinery that required precise care to prevent breakdowns. In one instance, a previous worker increased planned maintenance through overtime, creating a good ratio in the short term, but not necessarily improving results.

It's important to remember that ratios can sometimes be misleading, and it's crucial to understand the specific circumstances for clarity.</p>

            <p>Phillip, no offense taken. I mentioned this not as a critique, but rather to highlight the real challenge of defining "planned" work. Planning should involve foresight and proactive measures. However, some mistakenly equate scheduling with planning, as evidenced by various responses in this discussion. Ratios can be manipulated to serve different agendas, as demonstrated in your examples. For instance, following an RCM analysis at one facility, the CM/PM ratio increased, leading some to conclude that RCM is detrimental. In reality, around 30% of PM tasks were removed, allowing some components to fail due to low consequences. Additionally, 20% of PM intervals were extended. Yet, the RCM study also uncovered new failure modes that had previously been overlooked. While the CM/PM ratio may have suffered, total manhours decreased by approximately 30%, resulting in a 2% increase in facility availability. Ultimately, while the ratios may not have favored the maintenance team, the financial benefits were significant. It is important for the maintenance community to remember that our ultimate goal is to contribute to profitability, with KPIs serving as a means to that end rather than the end goal itself.</p>

            <p>When it comes to project management, it's important to understand the distinction between planning and scheduling. Planning involves identifying the necessary resources and services needed for a project, such as manpower, materials, equipment, and management services like supervision and technical expertise. Scheduling, on the other hand, is all about determining the specific start and finish dates for each task. This distinction is crucial for the successful execution of any project.</p>

            <p>Josh, your insights add a valuable perspective to the discussion by highlighting the importance of leading and lagging indicators. I recommend that we delve deeper into this topic in a separate thread. In your upcoming post, you touched on the significance of Planning in determining the work process, sequence, risks, and mitigation strategies. Planning can be likened to "mentally executing the work" before actual implementation begins. Scheduling also involves essential tasks such as preparing equipment, ensuring operational readiness, obtaining permits, stocking spare parts and tools, and setting up scaffolding, all of which are crucial for smooth execution without delays. This discussion revolves around the CM/PM ratios and their best practices. As mentioned by Phillip, there is no universally perfect ratio for CM/PM. In my opinion, as long as the CM/PM ratio and trends are on a downward trajectory, we are headed in the right direction. Analyzing one without considering the other is self-deception.</p>

            <p>I completely agree with your point, Vee. When it comes to planning, it's crucial to carefully break down the work into a proper sequence, create a detailed schedule, and allocate the necessary resources and services, including the elements you mentioned. It's important to note that cost is a trailing indicator in comparison to the CM/PM ratio and trend. Ultimately, these factors all contribute to the bottom line results.</p>

            <p>This post delves into the million-dollar question of what makes a successful run. While I may be veering off topic slightly, the concepts discussed are crucial for future readers. These principles are key in identifying training gaps, essential spare parts, consumables, staffing needs, hiring criteria, and other important factors for both efficient and subpar project management/construction management programs. While some might find these points obvious, it's important to remember that not all readers may be aware of them, hence the expansion of this post for their benefit.</p>

            <p>I believe we all agree that there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to equipment maintenance. In my opinion, achieving zero unplanned work is possible when the equipment criticality ranking and PM/PdM task identification are properly planned and implemented. This approach is crucial for optimizing maintenance efficiency and minimizing downtime.</p>

            <p>As Bittick once said, "The ultimate goal is to minimize unplanned work." While this is indeed accurate, it's important to note that breakdowns may still occur even if we intentionally choose to ignore them. However, these breakdowns can be anticipated and prepared for, even if they aren't officially scheduled. Embracing a proactive approach can help mitigate unexpected disruptions in workflow.</p>

            <p>Expanding on the concept of avoiding unplanned work, it is important to recognize that achieving zero unplanned work may be more of an idealistic goal rather than an attainable reality. Just like the theoretical concept of a black body in infrared or infinity in electrical resistance, any system will likely experience some level of random failures given enough time or usage. While striving for zero is a worthy objective, it is crucial not to overreact when a failure does occur. Instead, focus on understanding the root cause of the failure and address it directly in your preventive maintenance program if possible. Only by identifying and eliminating the root cause can you truly mitigate future occurrences and improve the overall reliability of the system.</p>
