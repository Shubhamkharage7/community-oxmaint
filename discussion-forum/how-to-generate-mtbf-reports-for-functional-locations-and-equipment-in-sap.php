                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Currently, we log breakdown data in SAP with a notification at the equipment level. I am able to generate an equipment MTBF report using transaction MCJB. While this process functions properly, I encounter an issue when attempting to run a functional location MTBF report using MCJC for the specific location where the equipment is installed. The report does not capture any failures associated with the specified equipment. The root of the problem lies in SAP's inability to determine if a failure of a piece of equipment also constitutes a failure of the functional location where it is located. 

If you have faced a similar challenge, I would appreciate any solutions or suggestions to resolve this issue. Would it be necessary to create separate notifications for equipment failures and functional location failures?</p>

            <p>Hello David, have you considered running a report to gather a comprehensive list of equipment located at a specific functional location (such as IH01)? You can then easily copy this list to your clipboard and utilize the upload from clipboard feature to populate the selection criteria in MCJB. This will streamline the process and ensure accurate data entry.</p>

            <p>Hello Steve, I appreciate your suggestion. However, it may not be feasible for me in all situations since our equipment is often moved between different functional locations. This means that the equipment currently at a specific location may have been located elsewhere in the past, even up to four years ago.</p>

            <p>When encountering issues transporting equipment within Florida, a solution could be to generate new equipment records for each new location instead of generating duplicate notifications. This way, the old equipment numbers can be deactivated. What do you think of this approach?</p>

            <p>Josh, I strongly advise against this idea because it would hinder your ability to detect malfunctioning equipment, regardless of its location. This could be detrimental to your operations and overall efficiency. It is important to be able to identify bad actors in your equipment for optimal performance and safety measures.</p>

Unfortunately, the MCJC screen is not responding when I try to run the reports by clicking the execute (F8) button. It is possible that there may be a customization setting that was overlooked. If anyone can assist, I would greatly appreciate it. Our system is still running on the outdated SAP 3.0F version.</p>

            <p>David, it is essential to maintain a record of equipment history in the FL system after relocating the equipment to a different FL so that we can accurately calculate the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for both the facility locations and the equipment itself. Can this be achieved?</p>

            <p>To ensure proper functionality and accurate reporting, it is essential to have a startup date in your F/L master for the equipment installation. This step is crucial for resolving Mafusi's query and ensuring that F8 functions correctly. By entering malfunction dates and times in the notification, along with maintaining startup dates for both F/L and equipment, you will see consistent results in MCJB and MCJC. Make sure to update this field to streamline the process and avoid any issues during equipment maintenance.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve, I followed your suggestion but unfortunately, it did not work for me. The issue might stem from the fact that the functional location I'm examining typically has five pieces of equipment installed, with two of them being rotables. For instance, there seems to be a discrepancy in the start date field. The current example shows the Start-up Date as 01.01.2000, with SAP history collected since 01.01.2004, the breakdown date as 01.01.2005, and the previous breakdown date as 01.01.2003 (not recorded in SAP). This poses a problem as SAP is incorrectly calculating the time to failure as 5 years instead of the actual 2 years. To rectify this, it is recommended to input the previous breakdown date as the start-up date or simply leave the field blank. Opting for the latter option will prompt SAP to disregard the initial breakdown and start future calculations from the date of the subsequent breakdown.</p>

            <p>In Australia, David mentioned that they currently record breakdown data in SAP and can run an equipment MTBF report using transaction MCJB successfully. However, when attempting to generate a functional location MTBF report using MCJC for the equipment's installed location, no failures are reported. This is due to SAP not recognizing whether a equipment failure also constitutes a functional location failure. David is seeking advice on how to address this issue, such as creating separate notifications for equipment and functional location failures. Trevors is interested in understanding the reason behind the need for a Functional Location Reliability report alongside the equipment reliability report, suggesting it may be part of a reliability improvement project to identify site bottlenecks. Clarification on this is requested.</p>

            <p>Trevors, you are absolutely right. Utilizing a functional location report can effectively pinpoint process bottlenecks, allowing for targeted problem-solving efforts. Similarly, equipment failure reports can also be a valuable tool, especially when equipment is integrated into SAP without being dismantled and reinstalled. However, our situation involves numerous rotable equipment pieces, with pumps being a key focus.</p>
