            <p>I have not received a response yet, but V has mentioned organizations like IEEE and ESREDA in a discussion about RCM for forklifts. I have also attempted to contact EPRI. What kind of power plant are you involved with? Is it coal-fired? Have you considered OEMs for conveyors and ball mills? Best of luck with your RAM study.</p>

            <p>One of the most extensive resources for failure rates in power plants can be found in IEEE Std 500. Although focused on electrical equipment, it also covers other crucial components like pumps, compressors, and fans. However, it should be noted that this document pertains specifically to nuclear power plants and does not include data on conveyors and ball mills. - Steve</p>
