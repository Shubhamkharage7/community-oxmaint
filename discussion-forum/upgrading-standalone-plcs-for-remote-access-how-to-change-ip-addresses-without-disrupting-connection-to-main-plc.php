                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am looking to upgrade three standalone PLCs to allow for remote access by changing their IP addresses. These PLCs communicate through an Ethernet cable to a main PLC, which can also be accessed remotely. The main PLC has two Ethernet modules - one for remote access and the other connected to the three standalone PLCs with different IP addresses that cannot be accessed remotely. Will changing the IP addresses of the standalone PLCs affect the connection with the main PLC? Can you provide guidance on how to successfully complete this process? Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Determining the make and model of your device is crucial to understanding the importance of the connection and how it is utilized. Changing the IP address may disrupt the connection, especially if devices are communicating via TCP/IP. It's important to consider other networked devices like HMIs, VFDs, or TCP/IP remote IO in order to maintain connectivity. For controllogix platforms, setting up RSLinx allows for tunneling through the main controller to access local network controllers without altering the IP address.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Will changing the IP addresses of the standalone PLCs affect the connection with the main PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Changing the IP addresses of the standalone PLCs should not affect the connection with the main PLC as long as the new IP addresses are correctly configured in the main PLC's Ethernet modules.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I successfully change the IP addresses of the standalone PLCs for remote access without disrupting the connection to the main PLC?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: To successfully change the IP addresses of the standalone PLCs, ensure that you update the IP configurations in the main PLC's Ethernet modules to reflect the new IP addresses of the standalone PLCs. This will help maintain connectivity between the main PLC and the standalone PLCs during the upgrade process.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  What steps should I follow to upgrade standalone PLCs for remote access while changing their IP addresses?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The steps to upgrade standalone PLCs for remote access while changing their IP addresses involve configuring the new IP addresses on the standalone PLCs, updating the IP settings in the main PLC's Ethernet modules, and testing the connectivity to ensure a smooth transition without disrupting the connection to the main PLC.</p>
