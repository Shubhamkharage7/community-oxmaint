                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hey there, 

We recently replaced the bearings on a closed coupled 5.5 kW motor that had been running smoothly with a maximum vibration of 3.2 mm/sec. However, after the change, the vibration levels have spiked to 50 mm/sec in the axial direction, 45 mm/sec vertically, and 28 mm/sec horizontally. This sudden increase in vibration is concerning. The dominant peaks in the spectrum analysis are at 1x and 2x in the axial, horizontal, and vertical directions. Can anyone provide insight into why these vibrations have escalated so drastically? Your expertise in solving this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Vidhya, did you notice any sudden differences in performance after replacing the bearings? When replacing the inboard bearing, is it necessary to remove the blower impeller or any other components? While this may not be relevant to your situation, abrupt changes can sometimes be due to imbalance, such as a piece of metal breaking off. It is important to consider the possibility that the 'new' bearings could be counterfeit.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Narayan, the blower impeller has been removed to replace the inboard bearing. After replacing the bearings, I checked the static balance of the blower and it was satisfactory. However, there seems to be fluctuating vibration levels, sometimes reaching 50 and other times dropping to 13. I will investigate the possibility of spurious bearings, but the trend persists even after changing the motor and taking new readings.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Including a cross-sectional drawing can enhance understanding of the details for readers. It seems that the readings spiked right after the bearing change, ruling out metal fragments as a potential cause based on static balance results with changes from 50 to 13. Possible reasons could include improper impeller mounting and faulty bearings, but without necessary data, we can only speculate. According to your notes, the blower continues to operate at excessively high vibration levels. At 2950 rpm, it would be advisable to halt operations and conduct a thorough inspection of the assembly.</p>

            <p>This scenario serves as a prime illustration of failures caused by human error. The motor was functioning smoothly at 3.2 mm/s before, indicating there was no necessity to change the bearing as long as the vibration remained consistent. Human errors play a significant role in causing failures in machinery.</p>
