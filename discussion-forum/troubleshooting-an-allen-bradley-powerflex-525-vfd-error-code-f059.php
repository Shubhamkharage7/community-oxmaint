            <p>The connection of both S1 and S2 to S+ is crucial for proper functionality, whether through a safety circuit or jumpers. It appears there may be an issue with the 24 volts on S2, while the presence of 48 volts on S+ indicates a potential internal problem within the drive. Further troubleshooting may be necessary to address these issues effectively.</p>

            <p>Terminal 1 is designated as the Stop terminal, while Terminal 2 serves as the Start/FWD terminal. However, that was not my query. When checking voltage, where should the black lead of your meter be placed? The factory jumper is connected to termInal 11 and 1, not 2. Is this a recent installation? If so, it appears that the wiring may have been done incorrectly.</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, a user mentioned that there is a 48v connection on the factory jumper between terminals 11 and 2, likely serving as a link to terminal 1. Another user pointed out that terminal 1 signifies the Stop function, while terminal 2 indicates Start/FWD. When measuring voltage, it's essential to note where the black lead of the meter is connected. Additionally, it was noted that the factory jumper is positioned between terminals 11 and 1, with the safety relay connected to terminal marked as n24.</p>

            <p>In a recent comment, Rmgy mentioned the importance of safety when connecting to terminal n24 on a relay. When measuring voltages, it is crucial to reference them to terminal 4, which serves as the common connection for the drive. It's essential to be cautious when connecting to n24, as it may involve dealing with multiple 24vdc sources. To ensure accurate readings, measure S+, S1, S2, and 11 to terminal 4 and share the results for further analysis.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information. Initially, I thought I was dealing with the safety circuit relays linked to the 24v controlling the relays. It seems the S terminals may actually be a switch tied to the main air supply coil, which isn't activating during startup. We recently installed this machine at the factory and have yet to witness it in operation. We are currently in the process of troubleshooting any potential issues before it goes into production.</p>

            <p>After completing a new installation, it is important to thoroughly inspect the wiring of the drive system. In order to ensure safety compliance, it is recommended to follow a specific circuit configuration for safety measures. This typically involves connecting the S+ wire through redundant contacts on a safety device and then back to S1 and S2 on a Rockwell PLC. If your safety device only has one contact returning to S1, it is necessary to jumper S1 to S2. It is important to note that the drive does not directly control the relays from the Safety terminals, as these are input signals from the safety device. The safety relay is usually powered from a separate source, which may pass through various safety devices such as E-Stop Pushbuttons, Gates, light curtains, and pull cords. If you have a schematic of the drive interconnections, please share it so that we can verify its accuracy. By following these guidelines, you can ensure a safe and effective installation process.</p>
