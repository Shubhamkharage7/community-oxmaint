            <p>I'm pleased that you followed my recommendation to create your own discussion topic. It would have been more beneficial to post it in the main forum section rather than the practice area, as posts in the practice area often receive less attention. To proceed, you will need to acquire Proficy Machine Edition software, as GE transferred their PLC and HMI product lines to Emerson some years ago. Contact your local Emerson sales office for guidance on obtaining a trial version. Total Control Products provides Quick Designer software, the original supplier of GE's Quick Panel product line. Keep in mind that there is no assurance that you will be able to extract the application from the Quick Panel. The original programmer holds the power to allow or deny end users from uploading. If they do not permit uploads, you may encounter difficulties.</p>

            <p>I want to express my gratitude to Steve for the prompt response and clear explanation. I have another inquiry: Is it possible to create a backup of the HMI using a flash memory or SD card, and then access it using the PME software?</p>

            <p>It should theoretically be feasible as the QP system operates on Windows CE. It is crucial to locate the files provided by Proficy for the HMI. While I have not personally attempted this method, I believe it may be more challenging than it's worth. If the initial programmer restricted project uploading, your approach may not circumvent this limitation.</p>

            <p>Hello Steve,

I wanted to express my gratitude for your assistance, and apologize for the delay in my response due to the holiday season in Morocco. Today, I successfully established a connection to the HMI and uploaded the project.

Here are the details:
- Software: Proficy Machine Edition
- Version: 7.0
- Operating System: Windows 7 Pro
- Communication method: Ethernet cable
- Panel Reference: IC754CGL06CTD-EE

For the process:
I initiated a new project in PME, added a new target (Quickpanel view/control), set the IP addresses for both the target and my computer (2.255.88.140 for the HMI and 2.255.88.211 for my PC), and completed the upload by right-clicking.</p>

            <p>Fadilis expressed gratitude to Steve for his support, apologizing for the delayed response due to the holiday season in Morocco. Today, Fadilis successfully connected to the HMI and uploaded the project from it. The software used was Proficy Machine Edition version 7.0 on a Windows 7 Pro operating system, with communication via Ethernet cable. The panel reference was IC754CGL06CTD-EE. To achieve this, Fadilis created a new project in PME and added a new target, specifically a Quickpanel view/control. IP addresses were set for both the HMI (2.255.88.140) and the PC (2.255.88.211). Despite following these steps, there were difficulties in uploading the program to the PME without the Quickpanel running.</p>

            <p>When setting up the Quick Panel, it is essential to ensure it is powered on. The View runtime application typically launches automatically when the Quick Panel is turned on, making it easy to start using the device efficiently.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Steve Bailey emphasized the importance of powering up the Quick Panel. It is typically recommended to have the View runtime application running, as it usually starts automatically when the QP is powered up. However, there may be instances where it is not necessary. If encountering errors with PME during uploading, it is unclear whether the panel application needs to be in rum mode. It is uncertain if placing the Quick Panel in transfer mode is required for this process. Thank you for your response.</p>

            <p>Do you know the specific error message and error number displayed? The developer who worked on the Quick Panel (QP) may have restricted the ability to upload from the QP to Machine Edition software. Unlike when downloading from Machine Edition to the QP, there is no designated 'transfer mode' for transferring data from the QP to Machine Edition. In this case, the runtime application needs to be closed down only when downloading from Machine Edition to the QP, as the software initiates the shutdown process upon starting the download.</p>

            <p>Hello colleagues, I hope you are all doing well! I am currently facing an issue with my Quickpanel IC754VBI06SFD-GF running Proficy Machine Edition Runtime 6.5, QuickPanel View V2.00, and Windows CE.NET v5.00. I have tried using both PME6.0 and 7.0, but encountered the same issue: "there was a problem copying the temporary project, therefore the temporary project cannot be opened." Can anyone provide suggestions on what might be causing this issue? I am new to PME, but I believe my IP address is correct. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>I am looking to transfer the program from my HMI Quick Panel + to my PME or PC in order to create a backup copy. I have configured the TCP/IP settings on the Windows CE screen and the PME, but when I try to load the program, nothing happens. If anyone can provide guidance on how to achieve this or suggest an alternative method, I would greatly appreciate it. Additionally, I have the backup saved on an SD card but am unsure how to open it in PME. If you have any insights on this, please share. Thank you for your assistance.</p>
