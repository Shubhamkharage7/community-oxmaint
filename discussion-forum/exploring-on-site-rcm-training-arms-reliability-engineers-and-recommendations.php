            <p>Hello Mike. I can supply you with a list of references in New Zealand and Australia. Our workshops will be taking place in Auckland and Christchurch in November, so be sure to visit http://www.reliability.com.au for more information. I am puzzled by Howard Primrose's decision to promote his workshop instead of providing details on ARMS as you requested.</p>

            <p>Hi Mick,

I hope this message finds you well. I was planning on reaching out to you directly. Do you have any resources or materials that you could share with me? We are in the early stages of exploring Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) at our plant to enhance our existing practices in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) optimization. While November might be too soon for me, I am looking forward to reviewing the course calendar for next year. I am also interested in exploring the possibility of a site training package, taking into consideration the associated costs. I anticipate involving key stakeholders in the training, not just myself, as I am keen on developing facilitation skills. 

My background is primarily in predictive maintenance, specifically in Condition Monitoring (vibration and oil analysis) within the plant. I have recently transitioned into a new role that is more focused on overseeing Preventive Maintenance, including Predictive Maintenance. 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Mike.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about ARMS, a forum member sought recommendations from other vendors. However, instead of providing helpful information, Howard Primrose used the opportunity to promote his workshop. It is essential to remember that this forum is intended for discussion and not for self-promotion.</p>

            <p>It's intriguing that you've just signed up on the forum board to address this specific inquiry - it almost seems too promotional, like a ploy to promote your services. Some of us dedicate a significant amount of time sharing our expertise on this platform without any commercial motives. When a question related to our field arises, it's only natural for us to respond. The workshop I am conducting is a favor for a colleague in Australia, and my expenses will be covered regardless of attendance. The sponsor, Clyde Volpe of READS Systems, in collaboration with Jason Tranter, has recently launched the Australian Vibration Institute. I am interested to see how active you'll be on this forum in the future. Users on this platform are always seeking more information. Best regards, Howard.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Howard, for your input. It appears that I misunderstood your perspective on the free kick, but I appreciate the correction. I want to mention that I have been a dedicated follower of Reliability web for several years using a different email account for forum participation. I took a break from posting but recently returned to find a request for information on ARMS Reliability Engineers, which has piqued my interest. With a wealth of experience in Reliability Improvement strategies, I am eager to engage more actively in the discussions.</p>
