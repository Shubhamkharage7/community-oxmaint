                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am presenting an attached analysis of a 3-phase AC Motor by the brand WEG, with specifications at 1200kw, 1630 HP, operating at 50 Hz with 6 poles and a speed of 1000 rpm. The signatures provided reveal pole pass frequency side bands around 1x and its harmonics in high resolution. Additionally, a normal signature at 3000 Hz suggests a pattern of rotating looseness. 

To diagnose the issue of cracked or broken rotor bars, further confirmation is needed. Evaluating the severity of the defect and determining if noise is evidence of the fault are crucial steps in the process. Understanding the probable causes of the rotating looseness pattern is essential for effective troubleshooting.

            <p>Based on the analysis of your spectrum, it appears that your grid frequency is 60 Hz and the rotor speed is 1000 rpm, equivalent to 16.67 Hz. The presence of bearing issues is indicated by anomalies in the waveform and the absence of rotor bar frequencies. A crucial indicator of rotor bar defects is the rotor bar frequency, calculated by multiplying the number of rotor bars by the RPM. While velocity readings are within normal range, the acceleration value of around 2 Gs points to a severe issue, as indicated by the unique signature of the values. Look for any bearing defect frequencies in the spectrum, as their presence would confirm a bearing problem. The 1X harmonics and elevated noise floor often signify looseness, but the root cause seems to be related to the bearings. Feel free to share your findings for further discussion.</p>

            <p>Dear Yasaswy, 

Thank you for your thorough investigation and valuable insights. In Egypt, the supply frequency is 50 Hz, different from the 60 Hz frequency in other countries. Although pole pass frequency is not visible in the spectrum, there are side bands around 1x and its harmonics 2x, 3x, 4x. A current signature analysis also reveals side bands around the line frequency. There is agreement on the presence of rotating looseness, but the source of the looseness, such as bearing frequency, remains unclear. Any additional recommendations for further investigation would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>When the pole pass frequency around 1x and 2xLF is present, it typically indicates an eccentric rotor. In this case, multiple issues are at play. The primary concern is significant looseness within the system, leading to impacts in the waveforms and pole pass frequency sidebands. It is likely that the bearing has sustained damage, causing looseness in the shaft and resulting in eccentric movement of the rotor. If there is noticeable noise, it is advisable to first inspect the bearing before proceeding with a solo run to address any potential issues.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Based on the data provided, it appears that there is evidence of looseness as mentioned before. This could be due to various factors such as a loose machine base, motor feet, bearing fit to shaft or housing, or coupling components. It is important to ensure the accuracy of the numbers in your data, which shows a calculated rpm of 997.2 based on a frequency of 16.62Hz. By subtracting this from 1000 rpm, we find a slip of 2.8. Multiplying this slip by the number of poles in the motor (assumed to be 6), we get 16.8 cpm or 0.28Hz pole pass sidebands. It seems unlikely that this issue is related to rotor bar problems, as the data shows a frequency of 0.43Hz. In my experience, sidebands resembling yours can be caused by a bearing outer race spinning in the housing. The presence of the 1x rpm and sidebands indicates the speed at which the bearing is rotating on the shaft or housing. While the impact in the time waveform is not excessive, it is clear that the looseness is a concern.</p>

            <p>Hello Dave and Yasaswy,
I want to express my gratitude for your thorough investigation and insightful response to my problem. I am strongly inclined to believe that the issue lies in the rotor bar defect, especially after analyzing the motor signature and observing sidebands around the line frequency at pole pass frequency. This has led me to be more suspicious of a rotor bar issue. To add to my confusion, I calculated a pole pass frequency of 0.438 Hz based on the actual RPM taken from the 1x frequency on the analyzer, which was 995.625. I would greatly appreciate your input on the current signature and eagerly await your recommendations. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I used the data from your plots to calculate photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) at 1x rpm. It is crucial to have precise rpm measurements for accurate calculations. Have you considered using a strobe light to ensure accuracy? Even a small speed variation of 2-3 rpm can have a significant impact. Check for the "swirl" effect as well, as described on pages 8-9 of the attached document. Other signs of potential rotor bar issues include overheating, drifting rpm, and frequent motor tripping. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, refer to the attached guide on using a Six Fault Zone Approach for Predictive Maintenance. This resource may help diagnose and resolve the issues affecting your motor. Download the attachment for more information.</p>

            <p>Dear Dave, I greatly appreciate your valuable insights and thorough investigation. Regarding the Swirl Effect, I have already identified line frequency harmonics resulting in a peak on the 5th of the LF. As for the issue of overheating, I typically use thermal imaging to assess this motor, which consistently shows a temperature 5 to 8 degrees Celsius higher than other similar motors. Do you have any specific recommendations for which parts to measure the temperature on the motor? 

Recently, the motor tripped due to high vibration on F1 and F2 (F1 being the fan inboard bearing and F2 the fan outboard bearing), both of which are equipped with online monitoring accelerometers. The trip occurred at a threshold of 11mm/sec rms in the horizontal direction, whereas my standard measurements at these points usually do not exceed 3.5mm/sec. The trip typically occurs during motor start-up, lasting only 5 or 6 seconds before resolving. Upon temporarily disabling the online sensors, the motor started up without issue. Subsequent vibration analysis using my analyzer indicated normal readings as before.

I am now seeking to pinpoint the root cause of the trip. How can I capture data during the brief 6-second motor start-up phase? Could a defect in the rotor bars be a potential cause of this issue?</p>

            <p>Attached for your viewing is a diagram showing how a faulty rotor can potentially lead to a trip. Loss of horsepower may occur if the rotor's bars are broken or if a bar dislodges and strikes the winding. It is important to monitor motor amps as a primary indicator of issues, rather than fan vibration. By utilizing advanced analysis and cascade features on your data collector, you can set up data collection for 15-20 minutes. The included 20-minute plot displays various pump combinations starting and stopping, with the goal of identifying any combinations that may result in heightened vibration levels.</p>
