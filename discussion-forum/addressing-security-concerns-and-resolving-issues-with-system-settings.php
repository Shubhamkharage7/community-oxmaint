                    <p>Hello, I would like to inquire about security settings in our system. We are using MP2 (SQL-Server 6 with patch 050319) that was recently migrated by a colleague from an older version. Unfortunately, this migration led to issues with incorrect indexes in some tables. Additionally, security settings were not properly configured, resulting in almost everyone having sysadmin rights. I attempted to create new roles but encountered a major issue - non-sysadmins are unable to create purchase requests, even when the new role has no limitations. How should I address this security concern and resolve the issue?</p>

            <p>Hey Josh, it seems like a good idea. However, from what I gather about MP2's security settings, creating a new role gives them almost all the same privileges as a sysadmin. My understanding is that I can restrict certain features in the security settings to limit their permissions. Am I mistaken in this assumption? How can I enhance the security of a role?</p>

            <p>If you have recently updated to the latest version, you may have noticed changes in the security model tables and internal references. This may result in issues with the MP2 GUI. If you require assistance with the updated security tables, feel free to reach out to me at stuart.kiddle@gmail.com. The 6.0 update introduced significant changes to security, particularly with the introduction of multi-site functionality. If you are facing challenges with this, I am located in the UK and willing to assist. Feel free to send me a sanitized database for a review. Formerly worked with ex Datastream MP2 technical issues.</p>
