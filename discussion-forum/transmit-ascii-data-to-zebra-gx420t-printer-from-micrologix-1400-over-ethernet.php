            <p>The MicroLogix 1400 is not capable of transmitting raw ASCII data over its Ethernet port. While a gateway device such as the Digi One IAP or a product from Real Time Automation may be able to facilitate this, direct transmission from the MicroLogix Ethernet port is not possible. Many PLC users often inquire about using the Zebra ZPL language, but it seems that the consensus is that users must implement this feature themselves. To date, there are no Zebra printers that natively support PLC protocols such as EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP, or Ethercat.</p>

            <p>I have recently begun working on a project that involves sending date codes and successive numbers to a Zebra printer using ZPL. Initially, the sales representative assured me that it would be possible, but now they seem to have forgotten our conversation. By "just," I mean that I am exploring existing solutions before attempting to create something new from scratch.</p>

            <p>Printing from a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) can be a tedious process. Since PLCs do not have specific drivers for printers, you often have to create your own solution. From my experience, using ASCII is the most effective method. One useful trick is to use label software to generate a label file, which can then be opened in Notepad to view the data, including special characters, that would be sent to the printer.

The challenging part is incorporating your data into the string. This involves breaking your string into sections, adding your data, and then merging the string back together. It can be a frustrating process. Additionally, if you want to connect via Ethernet, a converter is necessary. I personally recommend Anybus, but the choice of converter is up to you.

I suggest reaching out to the vendor who sold you the printer for the label software. They should have a function to print to a file. Create your label and save the file, then seek assistance to troubleshoot any issues. Keep in mind that there are no pre-written codes available for printers to operate with a PLC, making it a time-consuming and challenging task.</p>

            <p>If you’re looking to connect ML1400 to Zebra printers, you have a couple of options. You can either send ASCII strings from the PLC serial ports or invest in a Real Time Automation Ethernet to ASCII Gateway. Both methods will work seamlessly and instantly. Alternatively, you can try using socket-based Ethernet messaging via RSLogix 500, but it may require more development time. Make the right choice for your project and budget wisely.</p>

            <p>Plastic shared their experience with setting up communication from a PLC (such as the Zebra ML1400) to a Zebra printer, a process they have repeated numerous times in the past decade. There are two primary options to achieve this: 
A. Sending ASCII strings through the PLC serial ports configured for ASCII.
B. Purchasing a Real Time Automation Ethernet to ASCII Gateway for seamless integration.
Both methods yield instant results, or one can explore socket-based Ethernet messaging through RSLogix 500 for a potentially successful outcome with sufficient development time allocated in the project budget. For quick implementation and testing purposes, Plastic suggests exploring these options. If you have a similar project at hand and need guidance, feel free to seek further insights for a smooth setup process.</p>

            <p>Utilize the Real Time Automation 435-NBX for efficient automation tasks. Configure the RTA Web Server to target a specific string in your ML1400 PLC. Begin by inputting ZPL ASCII Strings into the designated string location in the ML1400. The RTA will continuously monitor this location and extract the ASCII data. It will then transmit the strings over Ethernet connections, formatting them into ASCII Serial strings for transmission to the printer through RS-232. Once the string is processed by the PLC, the RTA will clear it for future use.

Implement PLC ladder logic to track string length and initiate the next string once the length reaches zero. Refer to the Zebra ZPL programming manual to craft custom label designs. Start with basic labels such as "Test" and gradually advance by incorporating pixel-based coordinates, barcodes, and dynamic content generated through PLC data conversions and concatenations.

Begin by creating a static sample label and gradually introduce dynamic elements using PLC programming. Explore the possibilities of incorporating dynamic human-readable text and barcodes to enhance your label designs. It's a process of continuous improvement and expansion towards more complex label applications.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt response and providing the necessary details. I have sent a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to my supplier for the RTA 435NBX. When configuring the label as a string, will the entire label be printed as a continuous stream of data or will it be sent one line at a time based on the PLC detecting a string length of 0?</p>

            <p>I'm interested in the 435NBX, but the price point is beyond my budget for required testing. The cost per unit is $715, not including administrative expenses for company ordering. Can you provide more details on utilizing the comm port and message instructions from the PLC? I'm specifically using the ML1400 and will probably opt for channel 2. Any additional insights you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>To avoid using MSG instructions, simply set up STRINGS in the PLC and then transmit them through the desired RS-232 channel. Start by configuring Channel 2 with settings as ASCII 9600,N,8,1. Then, utilize PLC instructions like AWT and AWA to send your ASCII Strings to the Zebra Printer.</p>

            <p>Contr_Conn mentioned the possibility of MLX1400 performing RAW ASCII data transmission over Ethernet using Open Sockets. The information can be found in chapter 24 of the document provided here: http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/rm/1766-rm001_-en-p.pdf.

Dear Contr_Conn,

Thank you for bringing up this point. I believe you are correct. 

Have you successfully programmed a MicroLogix 1400 PLC to communicate with a barcode printer (such as Zebra) over Ethernet? If so, could you kindly offer some tips or guidelines to assist others in doing the same?

Thank you in advance for your help. Regards.</p>

            <p>When setting up a PLC to communicate with a Zebra Printer via RS-232, it is important to follow specific instructions to ensure successful printing. Begin by configuring Channel 2 as ASCII 9600,N,8,1. Next, use PLC instructions AWT and AWA to write ASCII strings to the Zebra Printer. In a similar setup with a Zebra ZD410 connected to a Micrologix 1400 via ethernet, ensure that the AWA function and MOV functions are correctly storing ASCII values into a string. Despite seeing activity when triggering the sequence, if the printer is not printing, consider the need for Real Time Automation 435-NBX for proper communication.</p>
