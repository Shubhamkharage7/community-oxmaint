            <p>Hello Rennie, I have a few suggestions for you to consider. One way to prevent hidden failures is by making modifications that reveal any potential issues, eliminating the need for constant maintenance. For example, a standby generator that was altered to run continuously now serves as a cautionary tale after failing to operate when needed. While this modification required an initial investment, it ultimately prevented embarrassment. Another strategy is to strengthen structures beyond the asset's expected lifespan, eliminating the need for corrosion or fatigue inspections. This approach can be applied to any item with a defined safe lifespan, ensuring longevity beyond your tenure with the company. For random and unpredictable failures, consider implementing design modifications to address the issue. For instance, switching to rubber tires can eliminate the risk of punctures, though other maintenance may still be necessary. I hope you find these suggestions helpful. - Steve</p>

            <p>Josh, the response to this question may vary among different individuals. In our opinion, project management changes can usually be implemented quickly with minimal costs, compared to design modifications which can be time-consuming and expensive. Additionally, modifications often get placed on a long list of other changes, making it difficult for them to get approved unless they promise exceptional returns on investment. Companies tend to prioritize modifications with significant returns rather than basing decisions solely on positive net present value. These are just my insights. Best regards, Steve.</p>

            <p>Steve, when you mention "startling returns," are you referring to achieving the highest returns, quick returns, or easily attainable gains that capture attention? I have some knowledge about project prioritization from my education, but I am curious if industrial plants actually utilize this method when determining which modifications to implement. It seems like they may simply assess the need for modification projects through basic cost/benefit analysis for each project, rather than conducting comprehensive project ranking exercises for all proposed modifications. If project ranking is carried out, who takes charge and coordinates the process - the maintenance department or the project department that oversees modification change requests, or the finance department?</p>

            <p>Hello Josh, To me, achieving impressive results means seeing a quick return on investment within weeks. These modifications are often easy wins, which is why I consider them essentially the same thing. The varying approaches to managing modifications in industries make it challenging to evaluate the extent of their impact on rankings. Some companies allow technicians to make changes without any oversight, while others have strict controls in place where all modifications must be approved by headquarters. Many companies lack clear guidelines on modifications, leading to a haphazard process where decisions are left to individuals to approve or deny. In cases where there is a formal process, significant issues and complex approval procedures may lead supervisors to overlook the rules and allow modifications to proceed. This presents a concerning picture for a profession that should value professionalism. There is still much progress to be made in this area. Steve</p>

            <p>Thank you, Steve, for sharing those examples. I'm sure many individuals have encountered instances of design out maintenance and would greatly appreciate it if they could also contribute their experiences with us. If you have faced any design out maintenance challenges, please feel free to share them with the community.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), designing-out a failure mode is only suitable under specific conditions. Firstly, it is necessary when there is a failure mode without a maintenance task to prevent its consequences, especially hidden ones impacting Safety/Environment. Secondly, redesign may be cost-effective when dealing with wear-in failure modes, also known as infant mortality. It is important to note that redesign encompasses more than just hardware or software changes; it can also involve people (training) or procedure revisions.

However, it is crucial to understand that eliminating one failure mode may introduce a new one. For instance, adding a dashboard indicator light to alert about a failed car brake light resolves the hidden failure issue. Yet, this introduces a new hidden failure mode - the indicator bulb itself. Hence, maintenance cannot be entirely eradicated as long as degradation occurs. Each modification, like design-out solutions, introduces new risks, making it essential for high hazard industries to follow strict change control procedures and often undergo detailed hazard and operability studies (HAZOP).

In order to manage risks effectively, top performers utilize risk matrices to rank modifications and set hurdles to prevent haphazard design-out proposals. Design-out is a valuable strategy when specific criteria are met, but it is not a quick fix solution. Thoughtful consideration and thorough evaluation are necessary before undertaking any redesign efforts in order to avoid creating more problems than solving existing ones.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Explanation: How is risk ranking used in modification projects with a risk matrix different from assessing equipment criticality based on failure consequence? It is essential to avoid making modifications to our cars arbitrarily. Therefore, conducting an initial screening is necessary to determine whether a full HAZOP or QRA analysis is required for each proposed modification. This screening process will expedite simple or minor modifications, like installing minimess fittings or gel dryers for lubrication-related purposes, that are deemed low risk. I often watch TV shows featuring car modifications and wonder if government approval is required for non-standard designs to be driven on public roads, as this is not shown in programs like those by Orange County Choppers. Is there regulation in place for these modifications?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The risk matrix, similar to criticality assessment, involves evaluating the probability and consequence axes. The tragic death of Alain Prost in an F1 car crash highlighted the importance of proper modifications. For instance, the steering shaft was shortened at Alain's request, but it remains unclear if a HAZOP was conducted. Even seemingly simple modifications, like those to lubrication or cooling systems, can lead to serious consequences under specific circumstances. All modifications should undergo a thorough risk assessment to prevent potential hazards. If operating scenarios are easily defined, the assessment process is straightforward. In cases where scenarios are complex, a HAZOP or similar analysis is necessary to assess and manage risks effectively.</p>

            <p>quote: Vee mentioned that Alain Prost's fatal F1 car crash revealed that the steering shaft had been shortened at his request. It remains unclear if a HAZOP analysis was conducted. Despite the tragic incident, it is worth noting that Ayrton Senna, not Alain Prost, was actually his racing rival. As someone with limited knowledge of the sport, I rely on a friend who is a passionate enthusiast to share all these details with me. It's surprising to finally find a practical application for the information he has been sharing for so long. - Laura</p>
