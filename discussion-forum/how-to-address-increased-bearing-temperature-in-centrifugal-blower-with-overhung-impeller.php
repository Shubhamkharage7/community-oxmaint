                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Operating at 1600 rpm, a constant speed centrifugal blower with an overhung impeller uses grease with simple lithium thickener (NLGI 2 consistency) and base oil viscosity of 100cSt at 40degC to lubricate its fan bearings (22216). Typically, the bearing temperature is 30degC higher than the surrounding environment. Recently, the motor current decreased by 10%, but after a minor maintenance, it returned to normal levels. However, the DE bearing temperature rose to 60degC above the usual temperature. How would you address this issue for the customer?</p>

            <p>Hello Mr. Vibration Expert, Based on the data provided, it is inconclusive. Please provide vibration reports during normal load operation. I noticed a 10% drop in amps and minor maintenance was performed. Could you please specify what maintenance was done? Additionally, when the DE bearing temperature increased by 60°C, what was the ambient temperature and the actual temperature reading? What were the vibration readings when the temperature rose by 60°C, and what were the temperatures on the Motor DE/NDE and Blower sides? How many bearings are there and what is the condition of the coupling? It would be beneficial to include a picture, spectrum, location, ambient temperature, and information on how the fan, air, and exhaust venting are being handled. Thank you.</p>

            <p>It is recommended to regularly check the axial positioning of the bearing seats on your machinery. It is crucial to ensure that at least one bearing on the shaft is axially free to accommodate shaft axial expansion. Bearings lack sufficient internal clearance to compensate for this type of expansion. Neglecting this issue can result in unusual spikes during load changes, particularly during start-ups. It is important to address this problem to prevent potential damage to the machinery.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why does the bearing temperature in a centrifugal blower with an overhung impeller increase above the usual temperature?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The bearing temperature can increase due to various factors such as changes in motor current, maintenance issues, lubrication problems, or other operational issues.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What are the typical operating conditions for a centrifugal blower with an overhung impeller?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - A centrifugal blower with an overhung impeller typically operates at 1600 rpm and uses grease with a simple lithium thickener and specific base oil viscosity for lubricating the fan bearings.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. How can a decrease in motor current affect the bearing temperature in a centrifugal blower?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - A decrease in motor current may indicate a change in the load on the motor, which can impact the operating conditions of the blower and subsequently affect the bearing temperature.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. What steps can be taken to address an increase in bearing temperature in a centrifugal blower with an overhung impeller?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Possible solutions may include checking and adjusting the lubrication system, inspecting the bearings for damage or wear, verifying proper alignment, and evaluating the overall operating conditions of the blower.</p>
