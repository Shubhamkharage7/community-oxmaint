            <p>Engineerj22 inquired about the readiness of the Stratix and its type - whether it's managed or unmanaged. It's essential to ensure that the ports are open for seamless connectivity. Testing the connectivity by pinging the Stratix from a PC is recommended. The Stratix can function as managed or unmanaged based on the port settings. By utilizing port persistence, devices are assigned IP addresses by the Stratix depending on the specific port they are connected to. Karin will attempt to ping the devices and assess the results.</p>

            <p>Has this issue been resolved? I am experiencing the same problem with an E300 module, where the Power, MS, and NS lights are all flashing green. Power is ready, the module is not being scanned by the EtherNet/IP master, and the module is online with no connections established. The Logix system is able to recognize the module, but the status keeps alternating between connecting and faulted. The internal status in the properties shows as "unconnected." I have already attempted to reset the module within Logix, power cycle it, and press the test/reset button. Despite these efforts, I am still able to ping the module. It is worth noting that this module had been functioning correctly since October 2018.</p>

            <p>Rockwell has provided a response to the issue of flashing/blinking green LEDâ€™s on the E300 Overload Relay. When the Power LED is flashing green, it indicates that the device is ready. However, if the Module Status (MS) and Network Status (NS) LEDâ€™s are also flashing green, it signifies a connection issue to the network.

To troubleshoot this problem, ensure that the E300 Overload Relay is in the I/O tree and that the correct Add on Profile (AOP) for the firmware revision is being used. Additionally, verify that Parameters 23 through 25 are correctly set in the field. Check Parameters 38 and 38 for any mismatches and investigate the cause of the discrepancy. Lastly, check Parameter 186 to confirm that trip bits are not enabled for devices that are not connected to the E300 Overload Relay.</p>

            <p>Although this may be an old post, it is still relevant for those who may encounter the same issue in the future. When all four lights are flashing on your device, it could indicate a hardware mismatch. In my case, the issue was caused by a 30-amp module being installed instead of the required 60-amp module. The flashing power light indicates a simple Ready state, while the flashing link light signifies active data communication. If both the NS and MS lights are flashing, it could point to a module mismatch. This can be a common issue faced by users searching for solutions to their device's flashing lights.</p>
