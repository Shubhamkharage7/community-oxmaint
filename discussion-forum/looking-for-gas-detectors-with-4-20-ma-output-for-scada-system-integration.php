            <p>We have installed CO, NO2, Oxygen, and LEL detectors from Det-tronic in 2020. Despite replacing nearly every sensor at least once, we have found the catalytic bead sensors for LEL detection to be unreliable. We have had to replace all Det-tronic catalytic bead sensors at least once, with many on their third sensor already.

Due to ongoing issues with Det-tronics, we have switched to RC Systems for new installations. We have installed approximately 10 RC Systems, mostly using combustible gas catalytic bead sensors for H2 detection. These sensors have shown significantly less drift, with no sensor failures reported after over a year of use.

Based on our experience, we will not be purchasing Det-tronic detectors in the future and will opt for RC Systems whenever possible.</p>
