                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, I am employed by a prominent manufacturing company in New Zealand with a total of 23 sites nationwide and several overseas locations. Currently, I hold the position of Project Manager for the implementation of "Maintenance Best Practices" at our New Zealand facilities. In this role, we are exploring the role of "Reliability Engineers" within our organization. Instead of creating a new system from scratch, I am interested in learning about how this function is organized and overseen in other maintenance organizations globally. Key questions I would like insights on include: What defines a Reliability Engineer? Who do they typically report to within the organization? In what areas of the business do they operate? What are the necessary qualifications and core skills for this role? What tools and support are essential for their success? Any assistance or advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Paul, I appreciate your insightful questions and would like to provide my perspective to kick start a meaningful discussion. 

One important topic to consider is the role of a Reliability Engineer within an organization. A Reliability Engineer plays a crucial part in promoting a culture of reliability throughout the organization, similar to a Safety Engineer. They are responsible for facilitating training on tools such as RCM, RBI, IPF, RCA, and more, as well as assisting in various studies, team setups, resource allocation, and result measurement.

Ideally, a Reliability Engineer should report to the Plant Manager or a direct supervisor if there are too many subordinates. Reliability is a key factor in ensuring plant safety, availability, and maintenance cost efficiency, impacting the overall viability and profitability of the plant in the long term.

While reliability is often associated with maintenance, it actually affects all aspects of the business, including operational failures, design flaws, and even IT systems and supply chains. It is crucial to view reliability as a holistic approach, as highlighted by Eli Goldratt in the Theory of Constraints.

A successful Reliability Engineer should have a background in operations and ideally a degree in Science, Math, or Engineering. They should possess strong interpersonal and communication skills, as well as the ability to align their work with business objectives. Passion for eliminating failures, a willingness to learn, and adaptability to new ideas are also essential traits for a Reliability Engineer.

In conclusion, these principles are often overlooked by many organizations, but implementing them can lead to significant improvements. I look forward to hearing different perspectives on this topic. Regards, V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Plant Managers, Operations Managers, Maintenance Managers, Reliability Engineers, and Planners, among others, play a crucial role in establishing and maintaining reliability in operations. This involves implementing a robust lubrication program and conducting root cause analyses and failure analysis to identify maintenance weaknesses. Training is then provided to address these weaknesses and strengthen the overall maintenance strategy. Reliability Engineers work closely with planners, incorporating vibration analysis and overseeing the Predictive Maintenance (PdM) program. Oil analysis and Infrared (IR) testing are also essential components of the PdM Division. Candidates should be prepared to work a minimum of 60 hours per week.</p>

            <p>I agree with your vision for an ideal reliability engineer. It is important to explicitly include in the job description that the candidate must have a strong understanding of reliability engineering as a core technical competency. The Theory of Constraints emphasizes the need for holistic transformational change rather than incremental improvements. Reliability is crucial for ensuring safety, availability, and cost-efficiency, impacting not just maintenance but also operational and materials costs. Reporting to the plant manager instead of the maintenance manager could enhance this focus. I encountered resistance from safety personnel when implementing a reliability management system, as they felt their existing safety protocols were sufficient. However, I questioned whether their safety measures alone could guarantee reliability and availability. This prompted a moment of reflection. It may be challenging to persuade operations to accept failure rates, especially when maintenance costs are often seen as the smallest concern compared to design. How can we address these perceptions and convince operations of the importance of reliability?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Traditional maintenance and technical services engineers typically handle aspects like vibration analysis, lubrication, thermography, ultrasound, and non-destructive testing (NDT). While a Reliability Engineer (RE) should have a solid understanding of these technologies, they should focus on mastering reliability engineering as their core technical competency. The RE's role is crucial in ensuring technical integrity is properly designed into projects from the beginning, as reliability is the foundation of successful operations. These are just some thoughts on the matter.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>The size of a company can greatly impact the responsibilities of a Reliability Engineer. In smaller organizations, the RE is likely to be more hands-on with tools, whereas in larger organizations like the one mentioned, the role may require more policy implementation and managerial oversight. This could involve overseeing multiple sites, with local factory RE's reporting to this individual for guidance and direction.</p>

            <p>Paul, I completely agree with the feedback from others. Developing a strong reliability program for your facilities goes beyond just maintenance - it requires support from top-level operations and management. The key goal should be achieving optimal facility operation, with preventive and predictive maintenance playing crucial roles in reaching that objective. If operations cannot depend on machines working as expected, meeting production goals becomes a challenge. To gain support, try explaining this concept to them. Considering the dispersed nature of your plants in New Zealand and abroad, initiating a pilot program at one site and then expanding it to others could be effective. Alternatively, focusing on a common area, problem, or critical equipment across all sites can also kickstart a reliability program. Successful reliability initiatives typically start small and involve identifying critical issues early on to strategize solutions effectively. Determining whether to begin with vibration analysis, thermography, ultrasound, oil analysis, or other non-destructive testing methods, and whether investing in NDT equipment is necessary, is crucial. Additionally, assessing the functionality of your CMMS and where your budget is allocated is important. A knowledgeable Reliability Engineer can help address these questions and steer your company towards effective solutions. Just my two cents!</p>

The ability to influence others is crucial in the initial stages of this transition. - Helen.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your valuable thoughts and comments on this topic. It appears that there is no unanimous agreement on the standard approach. My strategy is to clearly outline the objectives of establishing a Reliability Team and tailor a structure accordingly. I recognize the importance of combining practical hands-on skills with high-level analytical capabilities for certain scenarios. I aim to create a structure that caters to both aspects. I welcome any additional feedback and insights as I continue to seek knowledge in this area. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.</p>
