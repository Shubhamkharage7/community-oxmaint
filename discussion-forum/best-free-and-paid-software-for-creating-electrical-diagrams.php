            <p>Having used AutoCAD for over 30 years, I have a strong preference for it. You don't necessarily need AutoCAD Electrical; the regular 2D version, AutoCAD LT, should suffice. I still use the 2005 version to this day, but you can easily find a copy from the 2010 era for around $50. The choice of software depends on your intended use. For casual exploration, free open-source CAD packages may be sufficient. However, if you are creating drawings for installations or clients, it is recommended to use a professional software like AutoCAD. The AutoCAD viewer is available for free download, making it easy for customers and installers to view your schematics. Additionally, you can convert the files to PDF or create DXF files that can be imported into various other software packages, including HMIs.</p>

            <p>There used to be a free CAD software called Acad that closely resembled older versions of Autocad. While a search did not yield results, I remember using it a few years ago and being impressed by its similarity to Autocad. The program's speed was attributed to being mainly written in assembler, according to a blurb document that accompanied it. Although the name may have changed, alternatives like Freecad are available as well. Personally, I currently use Autocad Lite and have created my own libraries for electrical drawings. However, I find the newer versions to be slower compared to the older ones, despite offering better functionality. A colleague recommended Freecad as an alternative, although I have yet to try it. It's worth mentioning that Acad was capable of importing and saving DWG files, making it compatible with Autocad.</p>

            <p>I made the mistake of trying to cut costs by purchasing Smart Draw software. While it may work well with imperial measurements, it is difficult to navigate and not particularly efficient for various design tasks. For our electrical needs, we switched to SEE Electrical and for mechanical tasks, we use BricsCAD, both affordable options with permanent licenses. These alternatives are more specialized and user-friendly than Smart Draw.</p>

            <p>I made a mistake with the name - it's actually called A9cad. If you're familiar with the older Autocad interface, you'll be amazed at how similar A9cad looks. I found a helpful video on it by searching "A9cad" on Bing.

After downloading A9cad, I encountered multiple ads and prompts for other downloads, but I was able to successfully install it. I checked for viruses and everything looks good. The software runs pretty quickly, and this version is a significant upgrade from the one I tried years ago. Despite being impressed, I will continue using ACLT for now.</p>

            <p>For those who use AutoCAD, consider exploring NanoCad as an alternative. You can choose between a free (older) version or a $249/year subscription for the latest full version, which is more affordable than Autodesk licensing. While the free version is fully functional, it lacks features such as publish (batch plot) and has limited find and replace capabilities. I have been using the full version for approximately seven years and have found it to be a cost-effective solution compared to other options on the market.</p>

            <p>Having used Autocad for over 30 years, I have extensive experience in developing custom LISP programs to increase efficiency in day-to-day tasks. Through continuous learning and development, I specialized in Electrical Engineering, Instrument Engineering, and DCS engineering. In my later years, I transitioned to using Autocad LT at workplaces with dedicated designers. In my retirement, I have found NanoCad to be a valuable and cost-effective alternative, with a similar interface to Autocad that eases the learning process. NanoCad offers a one-year free license, which requires annual renewal.</p>

            <p>Parky shared that he occasionally loses sleep pondering various matters. Before retiring, when faced with challenges on a project, he would try to work out solutions even while in bed. Sometimes, his brainstorming sessions were so effective that he would get up in the middle of the night to resolve the issue, often utilizing the hotel room's complementary coffee. This unique method has led to some of his most creative breakthroughs while in a semi-dream state. Such moments of inspiration have proven invaluable in problem-solving.</p>

Priced at $399 with no yearly fees, ProgeCAD offers a similar look and feel to AutoCAD. I used ProgeCAD while working on substation control projects at a local utility, and it proved to be a reliable tool after our team switched from AutoCAD due to licensing issues. The software offers a 30-day free trial for users to test its functionality. Another remarkable free software option is QElectroTech, which operates similarly to Eplan with its drag-and-drop components and automated wire labeling features. QElectroTech provides strong support and performance for a free software tool.</p>

            <p>Consider purchasing a previous version of AutoCAD LT to save money and avoid the drawbacks of newer versions. Older versions can often be more efficient and less bloated. Additionally, compatibility is not an issue as drawings can still be easily exchanged between users of different versions - they can view yours and save theirs in the AutoCAD 2000 format.</p>

            <p>After using AutoCAD 2D LT 2007 for quite some time, I made the switch to a subscription and now work with either AutoCAD LT 2023 or 2024. Although the upgrade wasn't significant, one particular challenge I faced with the older version was batch plotting to PDF, which resulted in oversized documents that were difficult to navigate. However, with the newer version, such as AutoCAD LT 2023, I can easily produce a set of 60-70 page prints and navigate through them seamlessly without any lag, even on layout pages. I am extremely pleased with this improvement. I am currently looking to purchase an older version of LT, such as 2010 or 2012, for personal use at an affordable price, similar to what Robertmee mentioned earlier. Can you suggest where I can find these older versions for sale?</p>

            <p>Everyone loves a good deal, but when it comes to electrical drawings, using the right software can make all the difference. While programs like AutoCAD can technically be used, they often require a lot of manual management and time-consuming tasks. Investing in tailor-made software designed specifically for electrical prints can save you time and hassle in the long run.

One such software we recommend is Capital Electra, now owned by Siemens. Originally developed by a small Chinese software company, it has since improved significantly and offers a wide range of components for electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic layouts. The user-friendly interface makes it easy to create and manage prints without a steep learning curve. Plus, the software automates processes like bill of materials creation, component management, and wire numbering, saving you time and effort. Overall, investing in the right software pays off in increased efficiency and productivity.</p>

            <p>User bill4807 shared their experience with using an older version of AutoCAD LT 2007 before upgrading to a subscription-based plan for the 2023 or 2024 versions. They noted the challenges faced with batch plotting to PDF in the older version, resulting in large document sizes that made scrolling difficult. However, with the newer versions, handling sets of prints with 60-70 pages is smooth and efficient, even on layout pages.

Expressing interest in purchasing older versions like AutoCAD LT 2010 or 2012 for personal use, bill4807 is exploring options. However, a recent discovery from Autodesk forums revealed the termination of licensing for versions before 2017, regardless of original ownership. This development has raised concerns about the company disabling previously purchased perpetual licenses, leading to frustration among users. Despite this, some users, like bill4807, have found ways to preserve their older versions through virtual machines.</p>

This practice may seem unfair, as these products were initially advertised as perpetual licenses. However, this trend is becoming common in the software industry, as seen with Siemens and their product Capital Electra. Despite potential issues with reinstalling software, Robertmee recognizes the benefits of upgrading to newer subscription models, such as the time saved when using programs like AutoCAD LT on projects.</p>

            <p>In the world of electrical design software, it's crucial to have the capability to work with DWG files. While there are many software options available with automation features for creating drawings, editing existing DWG files can be a challenge. Some popular programs like AutoCAD Electrical, EPlan, and PC Schematic may lack the ability to efficiently edit DWGs.

For those looking for a cost-effective alternative to AutoCAD's subscription model, BricsCAD is a highly recommended option. Their basic 2D drafting software offers all the functionality of AutoCAD at a fraction of the cost. Investing time in learning BricsCAD will easily transfer to using AutoCAD in the future.

Although EPlan is gaining traction in certain industries, its high cost will likely prevent it from becoming the standard in North America. For professionals in the field, having the ability to work with DWG files is essential, making software compatibility a top priority.</p>

            <p>A few years ago, I utilized Promise E while working at a company before transitioning to using Autocad Electrical for a customer project. However, I found both software programs to be cumbersome and time-consuming to set up properly. Despite their time-saving capabilities, I felt that I spent more time adjusting settings than actually working on the projects. These programs may be more suitable for individuals without prior training or experience in creating drawings. Personally, I prefer using Autocad LT, which I access through a subscription plan costing approximately $440 per year. This plan allows me to stay updated on the latest versions and features. I have customized blocks that I use frequently and often duplicate entire sections of drawings from past projects.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, AutoCAD Electrical may not be the best choice for inexperienced designers. While it can save time once properly set up, the initial setup process can be time-consuming. It is a powerful tool that comes with a steep learning curve and a high price tag. However, for those who are willing to invest the time and money, it can be worth it in the long run. Personally, I prefer AutoCAD LT, which I subscribe to for around $440/year. This subscription keeps me up to date with new versions and features. I have also customized blocks to my liking and often reuse sections of drawings from past projects.</p>

            <p>According to Rson, EPlan is attempting to gain traction in certain industries, but its high cost is a barrier to becoming widely adopted as the industry standard in North America. This has led to limited awareness and acceptance of EPlan and its files in the region. As a result, I have decreased my involvement in General Motors design projects due to the costly EPlan requirements. However, there have been murmurs of other Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers transitioning to EPlan, possibly influenced by GM's support. Recently, some customers have been requesting mechanical designs in Solidworks for their projects.</p>

            <p>jstolaruk mentioned that he has not been involved in General Motors design projects recently due to the high cost of their Eplan requirement. There have been talks of other Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers transitioning to Eplan, possibly due to GM's funding influence. Additionally, there is a trend among customers in the industry towards utilizing mechanical designs in programs like Solidworks.

Furthermore, individuals interested in working at GM facilities now need to complete a GM course at Macomb County Community College in Detroit to obtain a certificate for access. It is worth noting that Eplan was developed by a former GM executive and was later mandated by his colleagues still within the company. The pricing for Eplan, including necessary add-on modules, starts at $13,000 for the base program and goes up to over $25,000 for the complete package.</p>

            <p>I have experience working on GM plc and hmi templates in machine builder's shops, but found them to be quite confusing and difficult to follow. However, the Fanuc template has remained consistent over the years, so I have mainly focused on GM robot work. Recently, some customers approached me about doing their GM plc-hmi work and offered to pay for certification, but I did not have the time to familiarize myself with it. I recommended a competitor with certified employees instead.

Regarding Eplan, I am aware of a service that can convert other formats to GM standards, reducing the need for extensive training. If the cost was more affordable, I would consider investing in it.</p>
