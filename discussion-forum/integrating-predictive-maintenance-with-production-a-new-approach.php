                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>As a former contractor specializing in VA, thermography, lube sample analysis, TEV, and ultrasonics, I have had experience in both routine and troubleshooting predictive maintenance work. Although I have left that field, I still have a keen interest in the topic. I have been contemplating the question of whether predictive maintenance tasks should be solely handled by the maintenance department. Could it be more beneficial for production managers to be involved in this process as well?

Predictive maintenance techniques such as VA, thermography, and oil analysis provide valuable insights into which machines need maintenance, what breakdowns to avoid, and which machines are closer to failure. Production schedules, on the other hand, are managed by operators and their supervisors who understand the direct impact of machine failures on business operations. Should reports on predictive maintenance be shared with production managers to help them prioritize maintenance tasks based on the potential impact on production?

This shift in approach could be the first step towards integrating production and maintenance systems to improve overall asset management. Do you have any suggestions for a new name for predictive maintenance once it is integrated into production practices? Perhaps something like "Proactive Production Protection," although that might be too cumbersome.</p>

            <p>How can Production Managers effectively use reports to address maintenance issues and improve equipment performance? Are they equipped to interpret and act on VA results to optimize operations? Many may not even be aware of key equipment components, such as bearings. Despite some managers recognizing bearing-related breakdowns, they struggle to differentiate between bearings and dampers. It's crucial for Production Managers to have a thorough understanding of maintenance findings to enhance equipment efficiency.</p>

            <p>What if a company implemented a Chief of Business Reliability to oversee all reliability concerns across physical, human, and intangible assets, such as customer satisfaction? This role would involve managing predictive maintenance and ensuring the reliability of all assets under their jurisdiction. Let's discuss the potential impact of this innovative approach on business operations and performance.</p>

            <p>The organization's structure will play a key role in determining the responsibilities of various roles within the plant or company. In my experience at my current company, the "Engineering Manager" oversaw a range of areas including Engineering (such as Design/Drafting and Project Engineering/Management), Maintenance (encompassing planning, stockroom management, calibration, and facilities maintenance), and Utilities (covering Electrical Power, Water Systems, Steam, Nitrogen, and Waste Management). There were multiple Engineers and Supervisors reporting to the Engineering Manager, each handling specific areas of responsibility. Over time, the structure evolved to include a separate Utilities Supervisor reporting to Operations and the transfer of telephone/page systems management to the IS/IT department. Maintenance Engineering also expanded to a department level, with a Maintenance Manager overseeing Maintenance Engineers and Maintenance Supervisors. In my opinion, predictive maintenance activities should be the responsibility of technical departments like Maintenance or Engineering, rather than Production or Equipment Owner Managers.</p>

            <p>The importance of Production lies in their role of following the Production schedule provided by Production Planning to ensure smooth operations. They are also responsible for understanding the consequences of equipment failures on business operations. To avoid such issues, why not consider transferring the responsibility of preventive maintenance (PM) to Production as well? Neglecting PM can lead to equipment breakdowns and downtime, impacting productivity. One solution could be to restructure reporting lines and have the Production Manager oversee the Maintenance Manager. Ultimately, effective communication between Maintenance Planners and Production Planning/Production Supervisors is crucial for seamless operations.</p>

            <p>When assessing costs and profits, equipment owners prioritize cost-cutting measures. In a startling example, a worker at a chicken farm recounted how sick chickens were given intensive care treatment in an ambulance. In contrast, when it came to upgrading equipment like the boiler for processing poultry, the owner opted to purchase a valve from a nearby supermarket. This demonstrates the importance of balancing expenses while maintaining quality in the agriculture industry.</p>

            <p>In response to your points, I believe the production manager may not prioritize understanding the modes of failure. Instead, he likely assesses the list of machines experiencing issues and quickly identifies which ones are critical for operations. He then shares this information with the maintenance department for them to take necessary corrective measures. The primary purpose of planned maintenance tasks is often compliance with regulations or meeting deadlines. Ultimately, it is a matter of keeping a schedule. Many companies struggle with deciding whether to postpone planned maintenance tasks, which often relies on the judgment of production and maintenance teams. Effective communication between planners and production is crucial, as some departments may not fully appreciate the significance of proper maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>Matthew asked for suggestions on a new name for predictive maintenance once it is no longer solely associated with maintenance tasks. Eugene suggests that predictive maintenance should remain within technical departments like Maintenance or Engineering, but not be overseen by Production or Equipment Owner Managers. As a consultant, it is essential to report to a designated liaison officer rather than directly approaching higher management figures. If the message is not reaching the right people, it could be due to a reporting style that is too technical or vague, or the organization may not prioritize maintenance. With the trend of outsourcing in industries like vibrating/thermal consulting, it is crucial to ensure that the liaison officer is well-informed and able to convey the importance of predictive maintenance to upper management. Failure to do so could reflect poorly on the organization's view of maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>quote: Do not let this conversation deter you from engaging. I stand corrected on my previous comment about the importance of quality maintenance management in a production department. I believe that a production department that values quality maintenance management can effectively guide maintenance teams based on PDM routines and reports. My experiences have shown that production departments in the companies I have worked for, past and present, appreciate the role of the maintenance department and are flexible in balancing production and maintenance schedules. However, maintenance departments often focus on maintaining machines rather than the overall function of the machine/system. This mindset has shaped my perspective, potentially influenced by my tenure in smaller companies or individual sites within larger corporations.</p>

            <p>Engaging in meaningful discussions is crucial for successful decision-making processes. Ultimately, the core philosophy and comprehension of decision-makers at every level play a vital role in determining the direction of an organization. Maintenance, just like safety, quality, or customer service, is a key business issue that requires attention. The decisions made by those in control of finances shape the policies of the organization. Having worked for a variety of companies, both large and small, public and private, I have observed diverse perspectives based on changes in ownership or CEOs. While one may prioritize cash flow, another may focus on profitability; one may value reliability while another aims to reduce expenses. In my view, the key to navigating these differing viewpoints is to understand and speak the language of business managers. By effectively communicating in terms that resonate with them, maintenance professionals can influence decision-makers. Just as a maintenance person would hesitate to take advice from an accountant they do not trust, the same applies in the opposite scenario. Building trust and mutual understanding is essential in achieving successful outcomes. Your thoughts on this approach?</p>

            <p>According to Phillip Slater, a strategic approach to bridging the gap between maintenance staff and business managers is key. By speaking the language of the managers and appealing to their motivations, maintenance personnel can effectively influence decision-making. It is essential to communicate in terms that resonate with the managers and to adjust presentations accordingly; for example, using blue, the Operations Director's favorite color, instead of red, can make a significant impact on their attention and approval.</p>

He simply looks at the list of machines experiencing issues and thinks 'if the chicken boiler breaks down, we're in trouble' before passing the information to the maintenance department for necessary corrective action. The predictive maintenance process could be hindered by this additional step of involving the production manager. How long will the report sit on their desk before they contact the maintenance manager about it? This delay could slow down the repair process unnecessarily.</p>

            <p>The central theme of this discussion revolves around organizational culture. The department responsible for managing activities is not as crucial as ensuring that the right expertise is utilized and 'appropriate' actions are taken. The significance of appropriateness cannot be understated, as it varies based on individual perspectives. Culture plays a pivotal role in shaping these perceptions. A company with a focus on reliability will approach situations differently compared to a company prioritizing cost-effectiveness.

In the 1980s, I advocated for 'maintenance as management' over 'maintenance as craft', encountering resistance from the maintenance team due to fear of losing control. The underlying issue was a clash of cultures - short-term cost management versus long-term cost management. When a new CEO, with an accounting background, proposed budget cuts after a plant upgrade, we successfully argued for increased funding by highlighting the advanced capabilities of the new equipment. This victory was a result of shifting the culture within the senior leadership group to recognize the benefits of our approach.

The lesson learned is to communicate effectively, influence decision-makers, and showcase tangible outcomes. Initiating small, unauthorized pilots can provide evidence to support your case. This strategic approach is often overlooked by engineers, perhaps because it requires a different mindset than traditional problem-solving methods. However, those who understand and apply these principles can bring about substantial positive changes within their organizations.</p>

            <p>I concur with Phil's sentiment that in order to showcase the value of your work in business, it is crucial to communicate effectively with decision-makers. Through my experience with various PdM team structures, I have found that having a specialized central team yields the best results. By allowing team members to share their experiences, cover each other's duties, and rotate tradespeople through the team, credibility can be established with operational and trades staff. Celebrating successes and acknowledging all team members involved is essential. This approach not only enhances communication between ops, maint, and CM personnel, but also encourages tradespeople to proactively share observations. Taking the time to explain processes, such as balancing a mill/fan or collecting vibration data, to tradespeople can lead to better collaboration and appreciation. It is important to lead by example and ensure that all team members are on the same page.</p>

            <p>In any conflict between Production/Operations commitments and the PDM/Maintenance program, Production/Operations commitments will always be prioritized. It is important to make sound judgments about what tasks should be completed and when, as translating technical information for production/operations management may be unnecessary. Trust with production/operations will be established once they see the consequences of disregarding communication, regardless of the messenger's position in the organization. Focus your efforts on ensuring that technology keeps everyone informed. Just my two cents.</p>

            <p>In attempting to connect the dots, it appears we are dealing with three main strategies: 1. Tailoring communication to resonate with decision makers 2. Ensuring technology is on point to yield results 3. Practicing complete transparency to address hidden agendas. Are these fair reflections? At first glance, all three tactics hold merit, though their implementation varies depending on context. To launch a new project, utilizing approach No. 1 is crucial to gain initial traction. As progress is made, a combination of No. 2 and No. 3 becomes necessary. However, it is essential to present information in a digestible manner for the intended audience. When facing challenges in an ongoing initiative, a blend of No. 2 and No. 3 must be employed, once again ensuring data is comprehensible. The danger many technical departments encounter is being perceived as technology advocates rather than strategic thinkers. To truly sway organizational direction, it is imperative to "sell" ideas effectively. After all, being right holds no value if your voice falls on deaf ears.</p>

            <p>The success of a Product Data Management (PDM) program is highly dependent on collaboration between departments. Effective programs will appoint a facilitator whose role is to communicate identified issues to relevant parties, such as supervisors, operators, managers, maintenance teams, and upper management. It is crucial to address any barriers to interdepartmental communication and internal politics to ensure smooth operation. As a consultant, I am often approached by different departments within organizations. Engineering typically seeks assistance with design criteria and installation specs, while maintenance focuses on planning for major failures during scheduled downtime. Manufacturing management is usually concerned with enhancing reliability and productivity. It is common to encounter tension between departments, which can hinder maintenance efforts. To determine the ideal oversight for a PDM program, it is advisable for large organizations to establish a cross-departmental group dedicated to manufacturing support. While maintenance or engineering may seem like suitable choices, an independent structure not influenced by internal politics may be more effective in overseeing the program. This approach may not be well-received by everyone, but it is necessary for optimal results.</p>

So, if I understand correctly, some individuals in this discussion believe that there should be no connection between maintenance and production. It's surprising to see such outdated attitudes still prevalent in the modern era. The truth is, production is responsible for delivering quality products efficiently, while maintenance ensures that production facilities operate at maximum capacity. Both departments are interconnected, whether you acknowledge it or not. Instead of blaming management or production for not listening to your concerns, why not try to collaborate and find common ground? Utilize your expertise in maintenance to address production's needs and priorities. Start with small steps and gradually build a trusting relationship. Show them the tangible benefits of investing in maintenance initiatives, rather than just telling them. It may not be easy, but with perseverance and patience, it is possible to gain their support.

            <p>In reconsideration of my initial comments, I appreciate the feedback from everyone. Typically, only in a large organization will there be sufficient production support work to warrant a separate department. It is important to note that engineering or maintenance are usually the most suitable choices for this, with accounting being a possible alternative but with potential implementation challenges. Marketing and sales are also worth considering. When it comes to avoiding politics within the organization, it is crucial to differentiate between political decisions, which prioritize the interests of a particular party or group over the organization, and business decisions, which focus on maximizing productivity and profitability with minimal regard for factions. In a profit-driven company, the majority of revenue is often generated by the production departments. As a maintenance professional, my role is to support the production team directly and indirectly, much like a doctor caring for a patient. Communication is key in this relationship, ensuring that information is clearly communicated and understood. While perfection is not attainable, fostering a culture where employees prioritize the needs of the organization can lead to job security and competitive wages. As a consultant, I have seen a variety of organizational cultures, some of which prioritize collaboration over internal conflicts. It is important to remember that consultants provide expertise but ultimately, it is up to the organization to implement and benefit from their guidance.</p>

This field is closely linked to both operations and maintenance, making it essential for reports to be shared with both departments due to the crucial role scheduling plays. Technologies such as Vibration, Infrared, Ultrasonics, and Oil Analysis, along with the need to enhance communication between operations and maintenance, align perfectly with the Engineering realm. Engineers typically possess a deep understanding of processes and how equipment integrates within them. Perhaps a fitting new title could be Asset Protection Coordinator, Supervisor, or Manager.

            <p>When it comes to managing data collection equipment, my recommendation is to start with engineering and then transition to maintenance and operations. The technology used for data collection has advanced to the point where troubleshooting can often be done on-site. This requires individuals who are intimately familiar with the equipment - its functionality, characteristics, and normal operating conditions. These individuals should ideally come from hands-on roles such as maintenance and operations, as they have a vested interest in ensuring the equipment continues to perform optimally.

Contrary to popular belief, the best candidates for this role are not necessarily engineers who prefer to work in a comfortable office setting. Many experts in this field have gained their knowledge through practical experience rather than formal academic training. In fact, a large majority of professionals in forums like this one have likely learned about predictive technology while already immersed in the industry.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, the presence of a team specifically focused on predictive maintenance within the engineering department plays a crucial role in the overall maintenance strategy. In my experience working in a technical services department, our focus was primarily on processes, projects, and inspections. However, in the upstream oil and gas industry, technical services departments often have dedicated sections that provide and support maintenance technologies. This allows maintenance personnel to focus on executing work tasks, such as collecting data for condition monitoring, while more complex data interpretation is handled by specialist engineers onshore. These engineers are available to tackle intricate problems during major projects like overhauls, modifications, shutdowns, and troubleshooting. Additionally, technicians are equipped to handle routine maintenance tasks and minor troubleshooting within their scope of work.</p>

            <p>As the Maintenance Systems Manager at Alcan, I oversee all maintenance operations and am responsible for implementing technologies such as PdM and IR. I provide detailed reports to Area Managers and Production Managers, as well as summarized reports to the entire organization, including the CEO. While the current system is functional, there may be potential for improvement by having a dedicated Maintenance Systems Manager for each area, reporting directly to the Maintenance and Production Managers. While this approach may require additional personnel and be more costly, it has the potential to be more efficient and create a more seamless process for the Maintenance Manager.</p>
