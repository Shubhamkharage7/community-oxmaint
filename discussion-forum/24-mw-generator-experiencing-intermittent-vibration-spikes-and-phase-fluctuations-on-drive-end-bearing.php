                    <p>Hello everyone, hope you're having a great day. Our company is currently running a 24 MW generator powered by a Steam Turbine (refer to attached diagram). We have been encountering sporadic vibration spikes and ongoing phase fluctuations at bearing no. 07 (Generator drive end) and bearing no. 06 (gearbox low speed shaft). The most significant change is in the 1X vibration. Please see the included Polar, Waterfall, and Trend plots for more details. Your professional insight and expertise are highly appreciated.

            <p>Is the intermittent peak occurring during normal operation of a 24 MW machine? Has this machine undergone previous maintenance? Can you provide the plots and details of the last startup? Additionally, could you please share the plot mentioned in your post titled "Your expert opinion is required"? It is crucial to provide data for experts to analyze in order to effectively solve any issues. Regards, RG.</p>

            <p>Dear Rotating Guy,

I appreciate your response regarding the recurring issue. The problem occurs during regular operation, starting after June 20, 2018, following the machine's start-up in March of the same year. Last year, the machine experienced multiple trips due to excessive vibration on the generator, which was later sent to the OEM for inspection. A loose retaining ring at the drive end of the generator was identified as the cause, leading to a short winding. The issue was rectified at the OEM facility and the design of the retainer ring was enhanced.

Despite initial improvements, anomalies resurfaced after June 20, 2018. Upon analysis of polar plots and spectra, a potential case of intermittent rubbing was considered (attached for reference). However, the regularity of the event occurring approximately every 7 hours raises concerns, as intermittent rubbing typically does not exhibit such precision in recurrence.

Best Regards,</p>

            <p>Jrva, can you provide a plot showing the trend of this event? Have you noticed an increase in vibration levels during normal operating conditions at a steady state? It would be beneficial to check the voltage gap of the sensor, as a gap of -16 for a prox probe has been known to cause chattering and intermittent peaks in the trend. I believe the issue may not be mechanical, so I would recommend addressing any electrical and instrumentation problems that may be affecting the trend you are seeing. Additionally, please provide details on how frequently the intermittent spikes occur and if any step changes coincide with these spikes. Your data would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Dear RG, Please refer to the attached plots for more information. The maximum amplitude of vibration remains constant during steady-state operation, but there has been a noticeable increase in the frequency of these events. Gap voltages show no abnormalities. Vibration levels gradually increase during these events. Best Regards,</p>

            <p>Have you noticed any changes in bearing temperatures, oil pressure, or ambient conditions? To rule out the Morton effect, consider adjusting the oil temperature. If possible, utilize an ultrasonic analyzer to combine data with your vibration analyzer using the demodulator (Peak-Vue) function, which can help identify any potential mechanical rubbing issues more accurately.</p>
