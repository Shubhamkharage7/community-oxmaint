                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Are you familiar with how Studio 5000 operates? My laptop is currently running out of memory, making it difficult for me to upload files from a small PLC at the plant. I've purchased a 1TB memory upgrade, but won't be able to install it until after fishing season. In the meantime, I'm deleting unused applications to free up space. For example, removing Studio 5000 Logix Designer V32 freed up over 500 MB.

I've noticed that there are three versions of Studio 5000 Designer on my laptop. Do I need all three, or can I delete some? It seems like each version was installed alongside Studio 5000 Logix Designer versions 32, 33, and 34. Do different versions of Logix Designer require specific versions of Studio 5000 View Designer? Can I keep one version and remove the others? It's puzzling why one version wasn't uninstalled when I removed V32.

I'm researching this issue, but would appreciate insights from those more knowledgeable about Studio 5000. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>When installing Studio 5000 Logix Designer (PLC's) and Studio 5000 View Designer (PanelView 5000 series HMI's), they can work independently of each other. If you don't have PanelView 5000's, you can uninstall View Designer without affecting Logix Designer's functionality. To free up space on your system, try right-clicking on your C: drive and running Disk Cleanup. You can also clean up old update files using admin rights, which can potentially free up several GB of storage. Consider using WinDirStat to visualize storage usage on your device. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary Logix Designer v32 software if your PLC firmware is version 32, as Rockwell does not support backwards compatibility. Remember that memory refers to RAM, while storage refers to disk space.</p>

            <p>I am currently in the process of familiarizing myself with Studio 5000 View Designer through a few projects. Similar to Logix Designer, having the corresponding editor installed is essential for creating a runtime for the terminal firmware. Unlike PanelView Plus, where you can create an older runtime using a newer Studio version, the process is different with Studio 5000 View Designer.

Recently, I have been working on a project involving a dozen machines, each featuring a PanelView 5310. These machines were initially set up in 2020 using Version 5 of View Designer. However, as I only have versions 7, 8, and 9, I was unable to upload from them directly. In order to proceed, I accessed the last saved *.VPD file for the project and was prompted to choose a version for conversion. A "_v5" copy was automatically saved.

In the process of updating the systems, I am utilizing ControlFlash to upgrade the terminals to version 9, which typically takes around 17 minutes. Interestingly, these terminals function just as effectively with newer v32 controllers as they did with the older firmware. I anticipate that I may require newer ControlLogix firmware to support certain features, particularly those related to tag-based alarming.

Given the option, I would prefer to update all terminals to version 9 and maintain only this version on my development PC. However, there is one facility that insists on using a specific software set matching their engineering computers. Despite this, they are reluctant to update View Designer. As a result, I must ensure that I am able to provide them with modified runtimes as needed.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the information, it is exactly what I was looking for. Our refrigeration plant utilizes multiple PLC's with V31 and V32. I don't anticipate needing to access the system this season, so we have decided to upgrade to V34, with V32 being removed. I have already spoken to the vendor who installed our refrigeration and automation systems, and they will upgrade to V34 this spring when the ship is in Seattle. 

As I will be leaving in a few weeks, I want to ensure that this laptop is functional for my colleagues to use in the two factories onboard. These factories are the main areas of AB automation we work with on a daily basis. One factory is currently on V33 while the other is on V34 (installed by different vendors). I aim to have the vendor upgrade the V33 system to V34 this spring, so all systems onboard will be running the same software.

Thank you once again for your help.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  Can I delete some of the three versions of Studio 5000 Designer on my laptop?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: You can potentially delete some versions of Studio 5000 Designer on your laptop if they are not needed. However, different versions of Logix Designer may require specific versions of Studio 5000 View Designer, so it's essential to ensure compatibility before removing any versions.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Why wasn't one version of Studio 5000 Designer uninstalled when removing V32?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: It's possible that the different versions of Studio 5000 Designer were installed alongside specific Logix Designer versions and were not automatically uninstalled when removing V32.
