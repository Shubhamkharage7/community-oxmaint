                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I work as an electrician but have limited knowledge of PLC circuits. Normally, I come across simple 2/3/4 wire terminations for transmitters on electrical blueprints, where the 4-20mA signal passes through a resistor before reaching the PLC analog input. However, recently I have encountered more complex input circuits that involve multiple resistors and capacitors. My initial thought was that it might be converting the 4-20mA signal to a voltage, but I'm unsure of the purpose of this conversion. I have included some photos of these circuit diagrams for reference. If anyone could guide me on relevant resources to further educate myself on this topic, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Thomas.</p>

            <p>Typically, 4-20mA sensors do not include resistors in their inputs. The exception is when a sensor's output voltage needs to be converted for a 4-20mA input, or vice versa. However, capacitors are not commonly found in these setups, unless they're being used to reduce noise interference. Please note that no images were included.</p>

            <p>Utilizing a precision resistor to run a 4-20mA or 0-20mA signal across input terminals can convert the signal into a voltage. For example, a 20mA current passing through a 2.5 ohm resistor will result in a 50mV output, while 20mA passing through a 3 ohm resistor will give a 60mV output. Similarly, a 20mA current passing through a 500 ohm resistor will result in a 10V output (0-20mA corresponds to 0-10V, while 4-20mA corresponds to 2-10V). Contrary to popular belief, analog inputs receiving mA signals are actually converting them into voltage signals internally via a resistor. Adding a capacitor to an analog signal may be uncommon, and could potentially alter the signal.</p>

            <p>Thomas suggested that the images will provide more clarity on the matter this time. As it is a 2 wire 4-20mA transmitter, the resistor shown in photo 1 will only cause the transmitter to work harder to output the desired mA signal. Being a 2 wire transmitter, it will adjust itself within limits to ensure the correct signal is sent without damage.</p>

            <p>A capacitor located downstream of the sensor is shorted out, rendering it inactive unless the jumper is removed. When the jumper is in place, there is effectively a total of 476 ohms in series with the sensor. The reason for this configuration is unclear. Once the jumper is removed, the capacitor is no longer shorted but is also disconnected from the circuit, resulting in no impact on its functionality. The only difference is that now there are 500 ohms in series instead of 476. The situation seems confusing and illogical, prompting speculation about a possible third option beyond simply having the jumper in or out. Perhaps a second sensor could replace the jumper, though this idea also appears nonsensical. The situation is quite peculiar and unlike anything previously encountered.</p>

            <p>Capacitors do not short circuit; instead, they act as filters. In the second picture, the capacitor is filtering the signal to a 0V level. I agree with Robertmee that it functions as a low pass filter.</p>

            <p>According to I_Automation, capacitors do not short circuit; rather, they act as filters. The capacitor shown in picture 2 is designed to filter the signal down to 0V, indicating that it functions as a low pass filter.

            <p>When the capacitor's bottom connection is not grounded, it is left floating. In this scenario, the lower resistor with the jumper still remains in the circuit, providing a parallel path and reducing the overall resistance from 500 ohms to 480 ohms. By using an online parallel resistance calculator, this calculation can be confirmed. The capacitor will eventually fully charge, causing the 10K resistor to no longer influence the circuit, possibly introducing a damping effect.</p>

            <p>As per the edited information confirming it's the analog input and not a jumper, the setup aligns with the image in pic 2. The signal consistently passes through a 10K resistor and is then reduced to 480 by a 500 ohm resistor while the capacitor charges. Once fully charged, the 500 ohm resistor is bypassed. This configuration streamlines the reaching of signal levels by the transmitter upon powering up, subsequently pushing it through the 10K resistor with greater efficiency.</p>

            <p>When constructing a control panel, one of the most frustrating tasks is wiring individual components, such as those depicted here. If these components are essential, the manufacturer of the device should have included them in the original design.

            <p>Here is the revised simplified equivalent circuit, following a breakthrough in understanding post-jumper/input configuration. While I agree with the suggestion for a low pass filter, I am curious about the role of the 500 ohm resistor in the circuit. It appears to create a voltage divider, albeit in a non-traditional manner, where the internal resistance of the analog input combines with the 10k resistor to redirect current through the 500 ohm resistor. It is possible that previous versions of this setup were designed for higher voltage inputs like 0-10V, whereas this new version is optimized for millivolt inputs.</p>

However, the purpose of the capacitor in the circuit eluded me. It became clear that my understanding was incorrect.</p>

            <p>In the realm of chemical engineering, one must carefully consider the contribution of various factors. When it comes to sensors and analog inputs (AI), there are a few key modes to keep in mind: current (typically 4-20mA) and voltage (typically 0-10V). The current from the sensor to the AI should ideally be less than 5% of the total current. However, in some cases, this may not make sense as the full 4-20mA range of the sensor may not align with the lower limit of the AI. In such instances, it's worth questioning the assumptions made about the sensor's current range.

To address issues related to noise and transients, a first-order low-pass filter consisting of a 10kΩ resistor and capacitor with a time constant of 1s can be implemented. This can help smooth out any fluctuations and ensure a more stable output. When dealing with different voltage ranges between the sensor and AI, adjustments may need to be made to ensure compatibility and accurate readings.

In certain scenarios, the inclusion of a 500Ω resistor may seem unnecessary and not provide any real benefit. Removing it may not significantly alter the overall circuit at the AI. It's important to evaluate each component and connection to optimize performance and eliminate any redundant elements that do not serve a clear purpose.

When the sensor operates at a 0-10V range and the AI at a 4-20mA range, the steady-state current levels may not align perfectly with the expected values. This discrepancy may be a result of the sensor's voltage range not fully matching the lower limit of the AI. By considering and adjusting for these factors, a more accurate and effective system can be achieved.</p>

            <p>In a recent post, drbitboy shared insights on a chemical engineer's analysis, presenting four potential scenarios involving sensors and analog inputs (AI) in current (4-20mA) or voltage (0-10V) modes. The analysis raises questions about the compatibility between sensor outputs and AI inputs, particularly in cases where the sensor range may not align with the AI's requirements.

One key aspect highlighted is the use of a 10kΩ resistor and capacitor as a first-order low-pass filter to address noise and transients in the system. However, questions arise about the necessity of a 500Ω resistor in limiting current from the sensor to 20mA, as its removal may not significantly impact the overall circuit performance.

Overall, the analysis points towards a likely configuration of a 4-20mA or 0-20mA sensor connected to a 0-10V AI input, emphasizing the importance of ensuring compatibility between sensor outputs and AI input requirements. The effectiveness of the low-pass filter in mitigating noise and transients is also highlighted, with room for further optimization in the circuit design.</p>

            <p>LegacyLee mentioned that there should be no concern regarding the field wiring, as the dashed lines represent it and the internal wiring should have already been completed. Any issues with the circuit should be ignored by those performing the field wiring, as it is not the electrician's responsibility. The individual simply wants to understand the situation. It is important for tradesmen to seek comprehension rather than blindly following instructions without questioning.</p>

            <p>In response to LegacyLee's comment, there should be no worries about the field wiring as it is represented by dashed lines. The internal wiring, which should have already been completed, is not relevant to those responsible for the field wiring. They only need to focus on the three simple connections and disregard the rest. If the circuit fails to work despite the correct connections, it is not the electrician's responsibility. This discussion is simply for educational reasons.</p>

            <p>The sensor operates in the range of 4-20mA, while the AI ranges from 0-10V with a steady-state voltage of 2V at 4mA and 10V at 20mA. The high side of resistors also remains steady-state. To filter out noise and transients, a first-order low-pass filter consisting of a 10kΩ resistor and capacitor is employed. By introducing a 500-ohm resistor in series with the 4-20mA 2-wire transmitter, a voltage drop signal of 0-10V is created across the AI input. Due to the AI input's high impedance, incorporating a low pass filter with a 10k resistor and 100uF capacitor introduces minimal error while effectively filtering at a low pass frequency.</p>

            <p>For those interested, here is an update on our recent findings. Upon measuring the voltage drop across the resistors and analog input, it was discovered that the analog input was showing a voltage drop approximately 10% lower than the 500ohm resistor. Our discussion with the switchboard manufacturer revealed that the circuit is designed to minimize noise from the flow meter we use, hence the conversion from 4-20mA to 2-10V. The reduced voltage at the analog input is adjusted in the program to maintain accuracy in readings. Additionally, the manufacturer explained the use of 220ohm resistors for the 4-20mA inputs, as the PLC brand we are using has a 40ohm internal resistance and the transmitters require around 250ohms for optimal operation. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>In a recent update, ImThomas shared findings regarding volt drop measurements across resistors and analog inputs. It was discovered that the analog input read a volt drop 10% lower than the 500ohm resistor. According to the switchboard manufacturer, this circuit is designed to minimize noise from a specific flow meter by converting 4-20mA to 2-10V. The program is adjusted to compensate for the reduced voltage at the analog input to maintain accuracy.

Further inquiry revealed that 220ohm resistors were used for the 4-20mA inputs due to the 40ohm internal resistance of the PLC and the transmitters' requirement of around 250ohms for proper operation. The information raised questions about the PLCs with only 40ohms input resistance, as most 4-20mA inputs typically have 250ohms. Exceptionally, there was one Danfoss controller with a 500ohm input resistance.</p>
