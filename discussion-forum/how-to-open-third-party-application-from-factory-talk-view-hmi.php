            <p>The HMIs running FactoryTalk Machine Edition, also known as Panelviews, operate on a customized version of Windows CE. These devices are limited in their ability to run third-party applications, as software must be specifically designed for Windows CE compatibility. Unfortunately, popular applications like Chrome and APKs are not supported on these HMIs.</p>

            <p>According to hardaysknight, HMIs running FactoryTalk Machine Edition, also known as Panelviews, utilize a customized version of Windows CE. These devices are limited in terms of running third-party applications, as they must be specifically designed for Windows CE compatibility. Unfortunately, Chrome and APKs are not supported on these HMIs. However, there is a Windows application available to launch the HMI, which can be used on any full Windows system. To achieve what the original poster (OP) is attempting, VB Scripting would be necessary to provide access for launching external applications. It's important to note that the scripting feature is only enabled in Factory Talk Site Edition. A quick Google search reveals a sample code for launching an external application using VB Scripting. By incorporating this code into a button, users can easily launch different applications by simply changing the file path. Just keep in mind that FactoryTalk SE is required for this functionality.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>BeepBob mentioned a Windows application that initiates the Human Machine Interface (HMI), suitable for running on various Windows systems. The task at hand may necessitate VB Scripting to access and launch external applications. However, this scripting capability is exclusively available in Factory Talk Site Edition. A quick search reveals a code snippet:

Dim objShell
Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
objShell.Run("""c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe""")
Set objShell = Nothing

Insert this code into your button, adjusting the path to the desired application. It's essential to utilize FactoryTalk SE for this purpose. For more detailed guidance on running Ignition on a PanelView Plus 6, visit Inductive Automation.</p>
