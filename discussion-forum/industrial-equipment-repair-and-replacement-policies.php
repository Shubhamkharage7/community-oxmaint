            <p>I have returned! Many businesses have financial policies that impact decisions, such as setting a Payback period or ROI parameter for investments in a new project. Even if technical issues suggest it's time to replace equipment, the final decision may be delayed if the economic analysis shows the investment will not be recovered within the specified timeframe. In such cases, the equipment may need to be repaired again instead of being replaced. It is recommended to reassess the economic justification to explore possible additional benefits or adjusted costs.</p>

            <p>Darth, you recently mentioned that when faced with technical issues, it may be tempting to replace equipment immediately. However, if the cost-benefit analysis suggests a payback period of 36 months, while the decision-makers prefer a payback period of 24-30 months, the decision may be postponed. In such cases, it is crucial to properly assess and justify the technical reasons involved. As Werner Heisenberg once said, being able to explain complex concepts in simple terms is a true measure of understanding. Similarly, Erwin Schrodinger emphasized the importance of sharing your work with others. Engineers often assume their cases are self-evident, but it is important to provide clear justifications when presenting proposals to senior management. Securing consensus and addressing weaknesses in a financially and culturally acceptable manner are key to gaining approval. Failure to communicate effectively with key stakeholders or to align with local cultural norms may hinder project success.</p>

            <p>Hey, I understand how frustrating it can be to deal with financial rules and goals set by decision-makers high up in the corporate ladder. If a proposal for a capital investment project gets rejected, it's important to revise the economic justification and make necessary edits to increase the chances of approval. Here are some strategies to consider: 

- Review regulatory requirements that could potentially override economic barriers, especially if the project aligns with environmental laws.
- Take a closer look at the estimated benefits of the project.
- Carefully analyze project costs to see if any can be reduced or managed differently.
- Explore negotiations with suppliers to lower prices and overall project expenses.

By implementing these tactics, you may be able to improve your proposal and increase the likelihood of getting approval for your capital investment project.</p>

            <p>When making decisions, it is crucial to consider economics as the primary factor. However, it is also essential to take into account intangible factors such as potential disruptions or supply chain risks resulting from mergers and acquisitions. For smaller items, it may not be practical to conduct a life cycle costing analysis. In situations where the value falls below a certain threshold, tax regulations typically allow for immediate replacement as a revenue expenditure, resulting in a 100% deduction in the first year. While this may enhance payback calculations and return on investment, it does contribute to maintenance costs. If an item's reliability is poor and cannot be effectively improved, replacement becomes a viable option. Higher capital costs require more thorough investigation to determine if repair is feasible. Despite challenges, human creativity often leads to innovative solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems.</p>

            <p>When faced with the decision to replace field instruments and small motors, many find that replacement is not only more cost-effective and efficient than repair but also factors in labor, parts, handling costs, and shipping charges. A general rule of thumb to consider is replacing anything that costs less than $xxx rather than opting for repairs. This quick economic comparison ultimately leads to quicker turnaround times and savings in the long run.</p>

            <p>Is it necessary to conduct a failure finding test on the PRV set at 430 barg? Can the PRV fail to open during an overpressure situation? If the PRV is leaking, the pump will continue to operate, indicating a passing PRV. Due to the complexity of removing the PRV for periodic testing and the extensive work involved in disconnecting numerous tubings to access the wellhead control module, breakdown maintenance may be the most efficient strategy to address issues with the PRV.</p>

            <p>When determining the appropriate course of action, it is crucial to consider the consequences of failure rather than rushing through the process. It is essential to regularly test Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) in the well-head control system to prevent potential issues. Failure to address dangerous conditions can lead to serious problems, highlighting the importance of properly functioning PRVs. Internal leakage, known as the fail-to-safe condition, is a concern of lesser importance.

In a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) I conducted previously, a faulty PRV on the control system was identified as a potential cause of a sub-surface safety valve failure, leading to a well loss. Although we later determined that this was not the direct cause, it was a significant factor that could have had serious consequences. The Company assumed that the control system vendor was responsible for servicing PRVs on the control module, while they handled the remaining ones. However, this was not explicitly stated in the contract, resulting in oversight.

During testing, we discovered that a significant number of PRVs were malfunctioning, exposing a flaw in the maintenance process. Difficulty in accessing PRVs should not be an excuse to neglect testing them. If necessary, modifications can be made to improve accessibility or find alternative solutions. It is essential to continuously challenge the presence of components like PRVs and remove them if they are not serving a useful purpose. On the other hand, if their presence is justified, regular maintenance is crucial. Failure finding tasks for PRVs are vital to ensuring the safety and efficiency of the system.</p>

            <p>I am currently dealing with a challenging situation involving the jamming of 60% of the pressure relief valves (PRVs). Despite being pressure balanced and spring-loaded, I am puzzled as to how these PRVs could become jammed. Could a potential well failure be linked to a safety shutdown valve (SSSV) malfunction caused by a PRV failure within the control system? Could a lack of containment result from the SSSV failing to close after the PRV fails to open? Is this the worst-case scenario we could face?</p>

            <p>When the control line is overpressured, there is a risk of damaging the elastomer seal of the piston in the operation of the SSSV, leading to the entry of well fluids and potential corrosion or erosion. This was documented through photographic evidence from a damaged SSSV teardown. Eventually, the piston may fail to respond, causing the SSSV to fail, thus hampering well operation. In our case, the overpressure issue was initially thought to be linked to a jammed control line PRV, but further investigation proved this theory to be incorrect. However, it remains a possible explanation. It is unclear how 60% of PRVs became jammed, possibly due to lack of testing or cleaning over several years. Speculation suggests that damaged strainers on the control system fluid path may have allowed particles to obstruct springs. Despite these theories, the main issue stems from a miscommunication leading to the lack of testing of PRVs, which ultimately needed to be addressed promptly.</p>

            <p>According to the vendor, it is possible for the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) to become jammed if large objects get stuck in the inlet, although this occurrence is rare. To prevent this, we ensure we have filters in place, use clean hydraulic oil, and utilize a flushing unit when necessary. While testing the PRV periodically is a good idea, it is not necessary unless there are issues with its functionality. Incorrect testing procedures could potentially cause further problems with the o-ring and spring.</p>

            <p>Josh, if you are hesitant to test the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV), it may be best to remove it altogether if you doubt its functionality or failure potential. It is crucial to regularly test PRVs in all applications to ensure safety and efficiency. Please recognize the importance of this practice, as I have no additional remarks to provide on the matter.</p>

            <p>I fully support PRV testing and value your input in strengthening my stance. I am delving into the reasons for and against it to better grasp differing perspectives. It's important to be persuasive, wouldn't you agree? Based on your experience, what is the optimal frequency to initiate PRV testing? Some suggest extending the testing interval to every 4 years for PRVs used in lube or hydraulic oil service and for fluid regulation rather than for overpressure or fire protection purposes. This approach seems logical and practical.</p>
