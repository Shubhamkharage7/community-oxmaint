                    <p>Hello, I am interested in attending hands-on training classes for myself and a few of my employees to enhance our skills in writing ladder logic and troubleshooting drives, instrumentation, etc. I have prior experience in these areas but am looking to further develop my knowledge and expose my employees to control systems. I have attended a Rockwell class in the past and am aware of the various options available. I primarily work with Allen Bradley ControlLogix and E&H instrumentation. I have heard great things about Ron Beaufort's training class, but it seems to no longer be offered. Any recommendations or alternatives would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>It is my understanding that Ron Beaufort, a member of the forum, transferred his "Boot Camp" training program to Phil Buchanan of Home - Key Automation Training. However, it appears that Phil has not been active on the forum since last autumn. Ron or Phil, please feel free to clarify if any inaccuracies are present.</p>

            <p>Mavrick inquired about in-person training classes for himself and a few employees to enhance their skills in Allen Bradley ControlLogix and E&H instrumentation. He mentioned attending a Rockwell class in the past and expressed interest in finding a suitable alternative, such as Ron Beaufort's training class. If you are situated in the midwest, there are distributors who offer excellent beginner-level training. Otherwise, online options are available for those who prefer remote learning.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a comprehensive PLC class outline with a focus on theory, be sure to check out the resources available at corsairhmi.com. This outline serves as the foundation for the beginner-level courses that I offer. I am committed to providing a solid educational base without relying on manufacturer-specific materials. It's essential for beginners to have a strong understanding of basic electrical principles, digital logic, and computer programming before delving into more specialized classes.

I've noticed a growing concern about individuals attempting tasks beyond their current skill level, possibly due to the wealth of information available on forums like this one. It's crucial to have a solid foundation of knowledge before attending manufacturer-specific classes or attempting complex tasks. Remember, it's important to understand concepts such as full-scale voltage and analog inputs before diving into advanced topics. Stick to the basics and focus on building a strong skill set before taking on more challenging projects.</p>

            <p>Corsair mentioned that there is a PLC class outline available on corsairhmi.com, covering essential theory for beginners. They emphasize the importance of having a solid foundation in basic electrical concepts, digital logic, and computer programming before attending manufacturer-specific classes. Avoiding manufacturer-specific material until one has a good grasp of these fundamentals is crucial to avoid feeling overwhelmed or wasting time and money. It is essential for individuals to have a clear understanding of basic concepts, such as voltage measurements across specific resistances, before delving into more advanced training courses. To prevent frustration and confusion, beginners should focus on mastering the basics before moving on to more specialized classes or tasks. This proactive approach can lead to a more successful and productive learning experience.</p>

            <p>Mavrick shared a similar experience to mine when attending a manufacturing training class years ago. It turned out to be a waste of time and money due to the level of complexity beyond my current knowledge. Like you mentioned earlier, if you are seeking a "Ron Beaufort" style training, I may not be him, but I strive to provide comparable training. 

There are numerous valuable online courses available for free to help your employees get started with PLC programming. Even if you decide to send them to a training class, going through online lessons first can be highly beneficial. When it comes to enhancing your knowledge, setting up hardware and practicing skills can be effective if you have the discipline. However, for most small businesses, getting off-site can help you truly focus on learning.

If you need assistance in exploring different options, feel free to reach out. I am more than willing to provide guidance, even if it's not related to my own training programs.</p>

He referenced our class earlier to cater to your interest in "Ron Beaufort" style training, acknowledging that he is not Ron Beaufort but aims to deliver similar quality training. There are numerous free online courses available for your employees to begin familiarizing themselves with PLC programming. Even if you decide to enroll them in a training program, they can benefit from completing online lessons beforehand. To enhance your own knowledge, consider setting up hardware and practicing your skills; however, for small businesses, off-site training may be more conducive for focused learning.

            <p>There is not much else to say except that it is beneficial to enter the classroom with specific questions and uncertainties. By doing so, you can gain a deeper understanding rather than just going through the motions. Additionally, having the opportunity to experiment without the fear of halting production or causing damage, and without having to incur personal expenses, is invaluable.</p>

            <p>Cardosocea mentioned that the opportunity to experiment without risking the production process or damaging equipment, while also not having to pay out of pocket for mistakes, is invaluable. The specific programming language used (ladder logic, structured text, function block diagrams, etc.) is not paramount, as they all serve the same purpose in the end: reading inputs, executing logic based on various factors, and writing outputs. The main distinction between PLC models and manufacturers lies in their available libraries of instructions. While basic instructions like contacts, coils, and rungs are easy to grasp, more complex ones like FFL/FFU, timers, counters, and one-shots can be challenging for beginners. Utilizing PLC emulators in environments like RSLogix Micro Starter Lite/RSEmulate 500, DoMore, and Siemens TIA Portal allows for learning anywhere. However, programming is just one aspect of PLCs - wiring, connecting sensors, scaling, communications, and HMIs are equally important. A designated educational sandbox with peripherals like trainers, HMIs, and other PLCs creates an ideal learning environment that separates schooling from practical education.</p>
