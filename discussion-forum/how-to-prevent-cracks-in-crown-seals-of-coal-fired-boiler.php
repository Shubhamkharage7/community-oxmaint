                    <p>Hello everyone, our plant frequently faces issues with cracks in the Crown Seals of the boiler penthouse. We have been attempting to fix the cracks through welding, but they reappear after the boiler is in operation. Are there any suggestions for modifying the crown seals to prevent cracks? Perhaps implementing expansion methods could help. Can anyone provide insights on how this issue arises and its root cause? Additionally, what is the purpose of the crown seal in a boiler?
