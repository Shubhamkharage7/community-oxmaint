            <p>I successfully established communication between my Keyence sensor and Rockwell Micro850 PLC by following a specific method. Initially, I downloaded the .eds file from Keyence and utilized the EDS hardware installation tool from Rockwell, resulting in the creation of three new variables (IV3_I, IV3_O, IV3_C) in my global variables. Subsequently, I modified the ethernet module in CCW to enable communication between the sensor and the Micro850 PLC. Following the detailed setup instructions for Ethernet/IP in the Keyence IV3 field manual, I successfully established a connection between the devices. Despite some discrepancies between the field manual's settings (8 bytes) and the necessary configuration (16 bytes), I was able to troubleshoot and find the judgment number for my inspection within the global variable after some trial and error. While the Ethernet/IP connection may not be fully functional, I was able to extract the required number from the Keyence sensor through persistence and experimentation. For more in-depth information, feel free to reach out to me.</p>

            <p>Over the years, I have successfully integrated various Keyence IV models (IV 1, 2, and 3) into systems, utilizing their well-documented Ethernet/IP and Profinet IO mapping as outlined in their manuals. Additionally, Keyence provides EDS/GSD files and Tag description files in CSV format on their website. While the tag description files are primarily for AB 5000 series processors, they may also be compatible with the Micro series. Although this information pertains to IVs, I am hopeful that Keyence offers similar support for the VS series. I plan on testing out a VS model in the near future to confirm.</p>

            <p>A user named PLCDontUQuitOnMe shared their experience with integrating Keyence IV models 1, 2, and 3 using Ethernet/IP and Profinet IO mapping. Keyence provides well-documented information in their manuals, EDS/GSD files, and CSV format tag description files on their website. While the tag description files are primarily for AB 5000 series processors, they may also be compatible with the Micro series. The user plans to test a Keyence VS series camera with a Micro850 in the near future to see if the same resources are available for that model. They are curious if anyone has successfully connected a VS camera with a Micro850 and the firmware version used for IV3 communication.</p>

            <p>Usually_Confused asked if the VS camera successfully interfaced with the Micro850 PLC and inquired about the firmware version of the Micro850 used for IV3 communication. The setup for the Micro should be similar. While I have not yet integrated the VS camera, I plan to do so in the near future.</p>

            <p>Epcalh01 shared their successful method for connecting a Keyence sensor to an Allen-Bradley Micro850 through Ethernet/IP. By downloading the .eds file from Keyence and using the EDS hardware installation tool from Rockwell, they were able to add new variables to their global variables. Editing the ethernet module in CCW allowed them to establish a connection between the Keyence sensor and the Micro850, following the detailed setup in the Keyence IV3 field manual for Ethernet/IP. Despite some initial challenges with Keyence's I/O map configuration, some trial and error led to success in finding the judgment number for inspection in the global variable. While not a fully functional connection, they were able to retrieve the necessary number. For more information, feel free to reach out to Epcalh01.I am currently working on integrating a new IV4 series camera with an Allen-Bradley Micro850 via Ethernet/IP. Could you please share your setup details for connecting the Keyence sensor to the Micro850? I would like to learn from your experience to see if I can implement a similar approach with the IV4.Thank you,mbigweav</p>

            <p>To enable implicit messaging functionality on the Micro850(E) programmable controller, it is essential to have firmware version 21.011 or later. Additionally, the Connected Components Workbench (CCW) software must be version 21 or above. Without meeting these requirements, only explicit messaging will be supported. Despite this limitation, I was still able to successfully communicate with a VS-L500MX camera using explicit messaging. While the process may be a bit cumbersome, it proved to be effective.</p>
