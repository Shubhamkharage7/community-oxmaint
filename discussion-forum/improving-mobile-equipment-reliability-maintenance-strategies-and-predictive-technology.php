                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>An important topic worth discussing is the maintenance of Mobile Equipment. Many companies have established maintenance cost per hour agreements that cover a range of components or all parts, with the company owner taking on the maintenance responsibilities. These agreements often include performance guarantees to ensure uptime. Some companies opt for fully outsourced maintenance programs such as MARC. These programs outline specific component replacements over contract terms that can span up to 10 years. While continuous improvement and extending component benchmarks are common goals, the real benefit lies in reducing the need for component replacements over the equipment's lifecycle, which typically ranges from 8 to 12 years for large Mobile equipment. When considering predictive maintenance, key factors to focus on include effective operating practices, maintenance efficiency, and the use of predictive technology. It's essential to utilize tools like oil analysis, failure analysis, CMMS planning, and inspections. There is a significant amount of online discussion around Equipment Reliability for fixed plants, but equal attention should be given to Mobile equipment as well.</p>

            <p>In my view, predictive maintenance relies on comparing current parameters to previous ones to make informed decisions. However, it is essential for the operating conditions to remain consistent for accurate assessments. For example, monitoring vibration in an internal combustion engine can be challenging when dealing with fluctuating speeds and varying load conditions. In such cases, oil analysis emerges as the most effective solution. When considering a vehicle holistically, the wear and tear on a 4x4 pick-up truck used for urban driving will differ significantly from that used in mining operations. In scenarios where replacements are time-sensitive, oil changes follow a different approach compared to replacing wiper blades, which wear out predictably based on environmental factors.</p>

            <p>I fully concur with svanels' insight on the importance of linking equipment history and failure analysis with a detailed equipment usage log. This log should encompass classified information on environmental conditions. By cross-referencing historical data with condition data, we can establish a foundation for trend analysis and predictive maintenance. This approach proves more valuable than solely relying on collecting vibration data, which can often be misleading due to the lack of a useful reference profile.</p>

            <p>Bob, you have brought up several key issues regarding Mobile Equipment that we need to address. Let's explore each of them in detail and find the best solutions to optimize our operations. 

1. Selecting the right Contracting Strategies is crucial for the efficient management of mobile equipment. Options include Health Care, Lease with guaranteed availability and reliability, Owner-maintained with parts guaranteed at a per hour cost, or completely contracting out to a third party for parts and labor. 

2. Implementing effective Maintenance Strategies such as Predictive, Preventive, or Breakdown maintenance is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of mobile equipment. 

3. Gathering Information and support data efficiently is key to making informed decisions. Utilizing tools like CMMS, Operating Logs, and other sources can provide valuable insights into the performance of mobile equipment.

It's important to address each of these topics individually to find tailored solutions that meet our specific needs. While Svanels and DC have touched on Maintenance Strategies, there is still much to discuss. 

Before moving forward, let's understand the reasons behind highlighting Mobile Equipment. Possible reasons could include their lack of rigid foundations, varying operating contexts at different sites, multiple operators leading to potential abuse, and limitations in maintenance opportunities compared to fixed equipment.

One general observation to keep in mind is that condition-based maintenance (PdM) requires clear physical degradation processes, measurable indicators, and sufficient time to plan and schedule maintenance work before any functional failure occurs. 

PdM effectiveness is not dependent on whether the equipment is stationary or mobile, or on the sophistication of the vendor's reports. Let's continue the discussion with your insights leading the way. V. Narayan.</p>

            <p>For many years, the key phrase in the corporate world has been to strive for excellence or world-class status. I specifically focus on mobile equipment because it is the primary method of transporting ore to the plant for the majority of mines, and the costs associated with this equipment have risen significantly. In the past, maintenance and asset life management were solely the responsibility of the owner due to the scarcity of MARC and guaranteed cost/availability contracts. However, we have successfully negotiated contracts where the owner handles maintenance while the seller guarantees component costs for a specified number of hours. By regularly conducting oil analysis, filter cleanouts, NDT, UT, and vibration analysis, we have been able to maintain system cleanliness and ensure structural integrity. The contracts we have now cover all risk components and parts, except for damages, leaving any additional reliability interventions at the expense of the purchaser. Assessing the insurance costs embedded in these guarantee programs is crucial when making decisions, as guarantees limit the ability to shop around for more cost-effective component rebuild contractors. My main focus has been on making informed business decisions, but I am also exploring ways to optimize mobile equipment reliability techniques. Unlike plant-related examples, implementing techniques like thermography, alignment, and vibration analysis on mobile equipment can be more challenging but equally important for overall efficiency.</p>

            <p>Dear Bob, I appreciate your detailed explanation regarding the context of your original query. I now have a better understanding of your perspective. Two key factors drive the 'best in class' approach: operational reliability of equipment and productivity of maintenance labor. These factors also impact maintenance costs, which appear to be a top priority for you. The comparison between operational reliability and intrinsic reliability often reveals a significant gap, with the former sometimes being as low as 20-30% of the latter. Closing this gap leads to various benefits: increased equipment uptime, reduced maintenance costs, improved safety and environmental performance. To achieve best-in-class performance, focusing on enhancing operational reliability is crucial. Techniques like RCA and RCM can be beneficial, but if they are too costly, consider starting with Pareto or Bad Actor analysis. Engage your maintenance team in improvement efforts to create a culture of reliability and enhance overall performance. Adjust your preventive maintenance activities based on your analysis results, and expect to see improvements within 6-12 months. Productivity is another key aspect that needs attention, and it's essential to prioritize quality alongside efficiency. Avoid the trap of sacrificing quality for productivity, as it can lead to a decline in operational reliability. Implementing reliable maintenance practices and productivity improvements will lay a strong foundation for contractual negotiations, ensuring a fair sharing of risks and rewards. Evaluating insurance costs within guarantee programs will help determine the most cost-effective decision, but this should be considered after enhancing reliability and productivity. PdM and age-based PM can be effective in industries like mining, where wear is a common cause of failures. Remember, reducing risks should precede entering into risk-sharing agreements to maximize benefits for your company. Making informed business decisions based on improved reliability and productivity is key to long-term success. - V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>When considering mobile equipment, it's essential to look at the entire life cycle costs, also known as asset management from "cradle to grave". This includes examining machine reliability, fuel expenses, efficiency levels, and design quality. Tracking fuel costs per equipment is crucial for optimizing operations. Additionally, evaluating whether the equipment is operating at peak efficiency and taking the best routes in the mine are key factors to consider. Incorporating life cycle costs into purchasing contracts can help avoid higher maintenance and operational expenses in the long run. Understanding the utility costs, including fuel, electricity, and water/steam, per equipment can provide valuable insights into overall maintenance costs and life cycle expenses. Monitoring fuel costs for individual mobile equipment is more straightforward than in a plant environment where utility distribution can be more complex. Efficient management of utility costs is crucial as they often contribute significantly to total manufacturing expenses. Good luck with your asset management strategies. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Bob, it's fantastic to see someone initiating a discussion about mobile equipment. Having worked in this field before, I understand the challenges that come with focusing on reliability initiatives. Here are some key points to consider about mobile equipment:

- Mobile equipment is often not seen as a bottleneck in production, as there are usually stockpiles or buffers in place to compensate for any downtime.
- However, mobile equipment can become a bottleneck if stockpiles are depleted, affecting the entire process.
- Unfortunately, mobile equipment is often undervalued and can lead to cultural issues of lack of ownership among operators and maintainers.
- Managing spare mobile equipment can be challenging, as it may become idle and then operated without being properly checked for maintenance issues.
- The maintenance costs for mobile equipment are usually higher than those for fixed plants.

So, how does this information apply to your situation? When considering maintenance for mobile equipment, think about whether it should be contracted out or kept in-house. Consider the value it adds to your operational chain and weigh the risks involved.

If you decide to contract out maintenance, make sure you understand your equipment needs and have contingency plans in place in case the service provider fails to meet expectations. Assess the consequences and probabilities of failures to determine the level of coverage needed.

In summary, consider the strategic decision of outsourcing maintenance, ensure the contract protects your company from failures, and be prepared to invest in a reliability program if necessary.

In the world of mobile equipment, reliability issues often stem from equipment implements failing, highlighting the importance of continuous improvement. Availability losses are commonly due to poor maintenance programs, emphasizing the need for proactive and predictive maintenance practices. The specific consequences of failures will depend on site design and process decisions.</p>
