            <p>When setting up P&C tags, it is common practice to add each PLC processor to the other's IO tree. However, this can become problematic if one PLC is significantly older than the other and the newer one is not compatible with the older one's project. In such cases, it is usually successful to use a similar CPU model that follows the same path as the unavailable one. For instance, if the older PLC is a 1756-L55Mxx and the newer one is a 1756-L7x, you can work around this by considering the -L7x as either an -L5x or -L6x, whichever is the latest version compatible with the -L55 model.

Issues may arise if the newer PLC is an L8xE and you are connecting via the embedded Ethernet port, as it belongs to the newest ControlLogix family. In this scenario, it may be advisable to initially configure the older PLC to recognize it as a CompactLogix with a built-in Ethernet port.</p>

            <p>It is essential to define the "consumed" tag carefully, as the processor version defaults to the most recent installation on your device. If the project is passed on to someone with a different version, they may face difficulties when making changes. This highlights the importance of compatibility when collaborating on projects.</p>

            <p>When setting up Produced/Consumed Tags, only the tag names, data types, and CIP Path are crucial. In my view, Studio 5000 should not prompt for the model or firmware revision as they are not utilized for keying. It can be challenging to get the CIP Path correct, especially when using an older version of RSLogix 5000 that does not support modern built-in Ethernet ports. However, a common workaround is manually adding a controller that is similar but not identical. There have been claims about the firmware impacting P/C Tags functionality, but it usually boils down to syntax errors or misconfigured CIP Paths, or a network unable to handle the traffic effectively.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach emphasized that when it comes to Produced/Consumed Tags, the crucial factors are tag names, data types, and CIP Path. A significant aspect to consider is ensuring that the data types match across systems. An example that highlights this point is when a contractor attempted to integrate their system with ours but encountered a hurdle due to mismatched UDT names. Despite having identical data structures, the Produce/Consume function failed to work properly. The contractor initially attributed this issue to a firmware problem on our older processors, specifically related to the EN4TR card. However, once both UDTs were renamed to "PLC_Comm_Data," the problem was resolved, allowing for successful P/C tag communication. Unfortunately, by the time this solution was discovered, our production had resumed, leading us to resort to using MSG instructions instead of P/C tags for data transfer. As a result, we were unable to implement the necessary download to establish P/C functionality. This experience underscored the critical importance of ensuring alignment in tag names and data types for seamless integration between systems.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Do PLC Controllers Need to Match for Produced and Consumed Tags?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: No, it is not necessary for both PLC controllers to have the identical model and revision number when setting up produced and consumed tags. As long as the controllers support the same communication protocol and can exchange data effectively, they can communicate with each other.</p>
