            <p>In order for a CTU (or CTD) to function properly, it must detect a transition from false to true on its input signal. If the input signal remains true before the scan reaches the rung where it turns false, the FSC will set it back to true before the CTU can register it as false. This results in the counter not being able to trigger more than once every two scans unless you manipulate the internal oneshot of the counter. To resolve this issue, consider replacing the CTU with an ADD instruction that increments an integer by 1. This simple solution will allow for smoother operation and avoid the scanning limitations caused by continuous true input signals.</p>

            <p>To optimize performance, consider pre-calculating TAVGÂ±1 and then comparing it with TagArray[CompareForAlm.POS] to trigger alarms. Alternatively, you can use the ABS function to determine if the difference between TagArray[CompareForAlm.POS] and TAVG is greater than 1.</p>

            <p>After conducting some rapid testing, it appears that you cannot use the result of a relational operator as an argument for the OR statement in logical comparisons. For example, '(x OR y) > z' is valid, but 'x OR (y > z)' is not. While there is no explicit mention of this behavior in the FSC documentation, it may be outlined as a broader rule in another resource.</p>

            <p>plvlce mentioned that they observed a limitation when using the output of a relational operator as an operand for the OR statement in FSC expressions. It appears that logical comparisons, such as '(x OR y) > z', are accepted while 'x OR (y > z)' is not allowed. This behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the FSC documentation, but it may follow a more general rule.
One possibility is that the FSC expression parser converts comparison results to a binary format (1 for True and 0 for False). For example, the expression ((A = OptionIndex) * OptionValue) + ((A <> Option) * NonOptionValue) could result in either OptionValue or NonOptionValue. Consider testing ((A>(TAVG+1)) + (B<(TAVG-1)))> 0 to see if it yields the desired outcome.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>I highly recommend transitioning away from complex Allen Bradley looping functions like FSC and instead utilizing ST, a universal language specifically designed for looping. By writing code in ST, you can expect improved clarity, enhanced control over data type conversions, increased flexibility, superior documentation, and reduced risk of unforeseen side effects. Additionally, using ST eliminates the need to be concerned about triggering transitions on the input. Make the switch to ST for a smoother and more efficient programming experience.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Why is my FSC not counting the instances of numbers below a certain threshold in my array?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> There might be various reasons for this issue. Make sure that the .IN is correctly triggering the counter and that the unlatch for self-reset is functioning as intended. Check for any errors in your logic or programming that could be causing the count not to increase.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  How can I troubleshoot my FSC problem with counting below threshold in an array?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Start by double-checking your FSC configuration, including the trigger condition (.IN) and the reset mechanism. Verify that your array is being properly processed and that the threshold comparison is accurate. You may also want to test with simplified inputs to isolate the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3.  Are there any common pitfalls or mistakes to look out for when using FSC for tallying below-threshold numbers in an array?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> One common mistake is overlooking the proper initialization of the FSC and ensuring that the count is being incremented correctly based on the threshold condition. Additionally, be cautious of any unintended resets or conflicting logic that could affect the counting process.</p>
