                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I'm new to posting here so I apologize if I'm not doing it correctly. Recently, there has been discussion about the latest building trends in Studio 5000 for Compact or ControlLogix controllers. I'm curious if it's possible to set up a trend to run locally on the controller and retrieve the data later, or if it only functions while you're Online with the controller and only for you at that moment.

I haven't had much experience with trends in Studio (as evident) and despite my attempts to research on Google, I didn't find much information. I even checked RAU for any courses related to "Trend" but came up empty. If anyone has a deep understanding of how trends work, I would greatly appreciate your insights.

Thank you for any information you can provide.</p>

            <p>The latest trends are driven by Studio 5000, not the PLC itself. To achieve your desired results, you'll need data logging software. Some popular options include IBA and Ignition, which are user-friendly. Another option is the pylogix module for python, a recent discovery.</p>

            <p>One useful feature in RSLogix/Studio 5000 is the ability to log data to your computer's hard drive. However, this function requires your computer to stay connected with the trend window open, even if it is not visibly displayed. Although this tool is primarily designed for real-time monitoring rather than historical analysis, there are other tools available for logging data. Many HMIs offer this functionality for a better historical viewing experience.</p>

            <p>In Studio 5000, trends are driven by the PLC, not the other way around. The PLC is responsible for collecting data at regular intervals, with shorter intervals being more effective. Unfortunately, trends are underutilized but are crucial for fine-tuning motion control applications. One helpful tip is to plot variables such as state numbers or temporary values in calculations that may fluctuate rapidly when viewed in ladder logic.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>One convenient feature of the trend setup is the ability to initiate it based on specific conditions, halt it based on certain criteria, and continue running for a brief period after being stopped. This functionality proves valuable in capturing sporadic events that may occur unexpectedly. By setting a stop trigger before starting the trend and leaving it to run overnight, I can come back in the morning to a comprehensive record of the event captured in the trend analysis.</p>

            <p>PLC trends offer rapid scan times, essential for monitoring data at the PLC level when the HMI is polling every 500mS. These trends provide a different function compared to HMI or Scada trends, allowing for data visualization every 10mS and the ability to detect coding issues quickly. Think of PLC trends as your personal Oscilloscope for monitoring bits, rather than an HMI trend.

Studio 5000 trends are ideal for debugging and creating timing diagrams for bits and logic. While they offer high resolution, they do not store data for long periods, serving more as a debugging tool than a data collection tool. I have successfully used trends at the airport to troubleshoot issues on-site, creating specific trends for analysis and transferring them quickly for swift issue identification.

Setting trends to a slower polling speed over 30 minutes can also be effective for troubleshooting purposes, allowing for thorough testing by triggering events such as hitting estops in the plant. Multiple trends can be run simultaneously, although screen space may become a limitation. Data from trends can be exported to CSV files for further analysis in programs like Excel.

While it is possible to store trend data on your PC, I personally found it challenging to set up. One efficient method for permanent trend data is to use Ignition software, which allows for database integration and transaction groups. The cost of implementing Ignition varies depending on the components needed, with the full package including MES 3rd party tools totaling around 30k.

For those with a knack for troubleshooting and programming, utilizing a Raspberry Pi with the pylogix library can pull PLC data into Python for custom trend analysis. However, for easier data recording options using Factorytalk, HMI scripts can be used to save data to an SD card. It's advised to avoid maxing out a PLC's memory for data collection purposes, as it can lead to drawbacks.</p>
