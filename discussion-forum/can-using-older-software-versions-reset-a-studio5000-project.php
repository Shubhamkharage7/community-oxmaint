                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently received a call regarding a malfunctioning PLC at a site. Upon remotely logging in, I discovered that the PLC did not have any project saved in it. Despite the site denying any power disruptions or physical damage, the mystery deepened when they mentioned trying to connect an older version of Studio500 (v20) to the PLC instead of the required v29. Is it possible that this action inadvertently caused the deletion or reset of the PLC? While I am puzzled about any other possible causes, I understand that the engineer likely did not intend to halt production for a significant period.</p>

            <p>It is unclear whether the issue was caused by an outdated software version, but it appears that actions were taken. The true cause of the issue may remain a mystery. Nevertheless, the system is now operational again. Job well done!</p>

            <p>To resolve a recurring issue of a V20 old 5555 PLC wiping its program monthly, a series of troubleshooting steps were taken. Initially, the backup battery, designed to last a couple of years, depleted after only 3 or 4 months. After replacing the CPU and adding a line filter to the 120V power source with no success, the ultimate solution was replacing the rack power supply. This resolved the program wiping issue and also corrected an analog IO problem on one particular rack. It was discovered that the root cause was not related to the PLC version, but rather the faulty power supply unit.</p>

            <p>Early revisions of the v20 software had significant issues that could lead to the problems you are experiencing. It is recommended to only use version v20.04 or v20.05 to avoid any issues.</p>

            <p>Given that your controller is operating on version 29 rather than version 20, the issues related to version 20 are not relevant in this case. If the local individuals only have access to version 20, they will not be able to communicate with the controller. Their options will be limited to loading the version 20 firmware, which will become apparent when attempting to connect to the controller. Identifying the root cause may prove challenging, as it could be attributed to various factors such as a faulty power supply, a high noise incident, an issue with the chassis (in the case of ControlLogix), or a problem with the communication cable utilized for connecting to the controller. This situation emphasizes the importance of utilizing an SD card (or CompactFlash for older controllers) to preserve a backup of the project within the controller. While it may not be beneficial in the current situation, it will certainly serve as a valuable precaution for future occurrences.</p>
