            <p>DataStream 7i has a long history, starting back in 1994 with its predecessor Rapier. Originally known as MP5 after being acquired by Datastream, it is now commonly referred to as Datastream 7i. Over the past eleven years, we have remained loyal to this comprehensive software solution which integrates Procurement, Stores, Maintenance, Engineering, and Purchasing all in one platform. With a daily user base of approximately 200-250 individuals, Datastream 7i continues to prove its value and reliability.</p>

            <p>Datastream includes features for budgeting, tracking expenses, making purchases, managing projects, and more. However, when it comes to managing HR functions, such as payroll, there are better software options available. There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for payroll software, as factors like bonuses, overtime, personal loans, vacation time, legal requirements, and shift work all need to be considered. While you can monitor how long a mechanic spends on a job, their pay should be based on a standard workday of 8 hours. Typically, after deducting lunch breaks and other non-working periods, employees are effectively working around 6.5 hours per day. The average hands-on time in the industry is about 4 hours, which falls under the realm of CMMS. Tasks like shop sweeping (housekeeping) should be separate from maintenance management systems. Similarly, HR and accounting require specialized software, with systems like SAP being more suited for accounting purposes.</p>

            <p>In my experience working with SAP and similar software, it is evident that there are more stories of failure than success when it comes to maintenance implementations. Often, SAP is utilized at the corporate level for finance, while another CMMS handles maintenance tasks. The decision to implement SAP typically lacks input from the operational and maintenance teams, as SAP's primary focus is not on maintenance. It is uncommon to hear of a SAP implementation costing less than $1,000,000, excluding hardware expenses. SAP is generally considered too costly and complex for small to medium-sized businesses with fewer than 100 employees. Datastream, which we use alongside Oracle for our database needs, is also not inexpensive but more affordable compared to SAP. From my 11 years of experience working with the same CMMS system, I find that SAP is viewed more as accounting software with a maintenance module.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Did you know that SAP is divided into three major divisions: Logistics, Accounting, and HR? Each division is comprised of various modules. For example, the Logistics division includes Production Planning, Plant Maintenance, Material Management, Project Management, Quality Management, and Sales and Distribution. Plant Maintenance (PM) covers aspects such as technical objects (functional locations, equipment, bill of materials), work centers (Rotating, Static, Electrical, Instrument, Civil), maintenance task lists, maintenance planning and scheduling, maintenance processing, and PM information systems for statistics.

Material Management includes technical objects like material masters, inventory management, warehouse management, materials planning, and MM information systems for KPIs. When considering implementing SAP, it's important to integrate all modules and divisions for a comprehensive solution. Proper management of IT infrastructure is crucial, along with setting up master data for equipment, materials, tools, and measurement points for success.

Regarding concerns about failure rates and lack of input from operations and maintenance personnel during implementation, involving O&M staff and ensuring all divisions communicate effectively can lead to success. While the cost of SAP can be high due to its size, it is possible for one ID to be shared by up to six people logging in simultaneously.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When comparing solutions for plant maintenance and material management, Datastream is a cost-effective alternative to SAP. While SAP is a popular choice, it can be the most expensive to implement. To successfully implement SAP, management commitment, long-term vision, computer-literate personnel, experienced IT staff, and a significant financial investment are essential. Without these key elements, the full implementation of SAP can be a challenging and costly nightmare. Consider exploring other, more budget-friendly solutions that have proven successful for many maintenance and IT managers. Remember, politics and stakeholder management are vital aspects of any business decision-making process.</p>
            <ul class="post-meta mb-0">
                <li class="post-date"><i class="uil uil-calendar-alt"></i><span>04-07-2024</span></li>
                <li class="post-author"><i class="uil uil-user"></i><span>Ian Butler</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When implementing various modules, it is essential to integrate them rather than working on them separately. A staggered approach can be taken, implementing one module at a time over different timeframes to prevent overwhelming workloads. For example, in the first year, Accounting can be implemented, followed by Logistics in the second year, and HR in the third. This staggered implementation method, as opposed to a big bang approach, can still be successful if done correctly. 

After implementation, the benefits of this hard work and investment can be enjoyed, especially when utilizing information systems for Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which should be configured properly. Setting up proper KPIs in the information systems should be done by subject matter experts like Operations and Maintenance (O&M) users, rather than IT personnel. It is crucial to have the users' knowledge levels evaluated before implementing any software to ensure they can effectively utilize it. Bringing all users to a minimum level of understanding is necessary for successful implementation. 

To sum up, the key lies in how well users understand and use the software, rather than the software itself. This perspective is based on personal experience with SAP.</p>
