            <p>In order to successfully connect your device, you must install the necessary driver. Once plugged in, the device should be recognized as a COM number in your device manager. You will then need to input this specific number into GXWorks for it to function correctly. This process is essential for seamless communication between your device and the software.</p>

            <p>The QC30R2 device operates within a range of 232 to 422. If you are using a USB to 232 converter, there may be compatibility issues with certain chipsets like FTDI and PLXXX. The FTDI chipset is older and may not be compatible with Win11 as its driver has not been updated. Make sure to install the necessary driver for the device, which may default to com3 even if com1 and com2 are not present. As suggested by experts, addressing these driver issues is crucial for seamless operation.</p>

            <p>In response to Parky, it seems that the QC30R2 has a 232 to 422 connection. If this is connected to a USB to 232 converter, there may be compatibility issues with certain chipsets such as FTDI or PLXXX. It is important to note that one of these chipsets is outdated and may not function properly on Windows 11, as the driver has not been updated. As pointed out by Genius, it is necessary to install the driver, which may default to com3 even if com1 and com2 are not present. Therefore, there may be limitations when using Win11 with this device.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it is important to ensure that the USB to 232 cable you are using has the latest chipset, such as the PL2303. To check this, you can navigate to the device manager and click on "Ports, COM & LPT" to view the chipset type and COM port. If everything is working correctly, it will indicate that the device is functioning properly. It is worth noting that some sellers on Amazon and eBay are still offering older FTDI-based converters, which may not be compatible with Windows 11 due to changes in USB/port access by Microsoft. Make sure to opt for the latest chipset to avoid compatibility issues.</p>

            <p>Parky mentioned that the QC30R2 operates between 232 and 422 and assumes it is connected to a USB to 232 converter. However, the QC30R2 is actually a USB to RS232 converter itself, while the Q02CPU operates on RS232 without the need for an additional adapter. The only requirement is to ensure the COM numbers match. The common mistake of selecting USB can easily be rectified, and the setup works seamlessly on W11.</p>

            <p>Multiple websites, including RS and eBay, list the cable as 232 only, and Mitsubishi also specifies it as 232 only. It seems that people are selling it under that specific part number. I personally have one connected to my laptop via a USB to 232 converter. It is important to note that some USB-QC30R2 cables found on online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay may not be compatible with Windows 11. This issue could be related to the FTDI chipset used in these cables, as a driver may not have been developed for Windows 11. I was able to make it work temporarily with a different driver, but it would stop working every time I rebooted my PC. Unfortunately, I was unable to find an updated driver for it and eventually gave up trying to fix the issue.</p>

            <p>For nearly three decades, I have specialized in creating PLC cables. The OP mentioned using a USB QC30R2 cable for their setup. It's important to note that QC30R2 is simply a cable part number, and adding "USB" in front of it creates a different part, but both still utilize RS232. All of my cables are compatible with Windows 11. One of my popular cables, which I have been producing for over 15 years, is the Mitsubishi USB-QC30R2 Q Series RS232 Programming Cable. Check out my website for more PLC Cables, PLC Trainers, and Industrial Automation Supplies at plccable.com. You can also find this cable listed on eBay under the title "Mitsubishi USB-QC30R2 Q Series RS232 Programming Cable." It is specifically designed for the Q series PLC.

            <p>I understand that you and others are selling similar products, but the original poster mentioned a USB to QC30R2 connection, which should actually be a USB-QC30R2. It seems like the OP might be using a USB to 232 adapter to connect to QC30R2, which typically involves a 9-pin to 8-pin mini dip configuration. Paying attention to these details is crucial, as it can be confusing. Do we have clarity on what exactly the OP is using? It could be a combination of cables or a product purchased from platforms like Amazon or Ebay. A colleague faced a similar issue, and while I couldn't get it to work on my PC, it worked when connected to an older Win7 laptop.</p>

Older FTDI converters are still being sold on Amazon and eBay, but they may not be compatible with Windows 11 due to changes in USB/port access by Microsoft. It appears that the USB converter is unable to convert QC30R2. However, when using a Moxa converter, which can convert RS232, 422, and 425 signals, it can connect online with the PLC.</p>
