            <p>Do you wish to delve into this topic? The truth is, uncertainty reigns â€“ no one holds all the answers. Your query unravels into various layers, and I shall endeavor to navigate through them. While I may not be a Part 11 expert, my company boasts several experts, and my interactions with them have shed light on Part 11 compliance. 
When it comes to "Electronic Signatures", it's important to note that PLCs are not designed for direct human interaction. Electronic signatures must be obtained via SCADA/HMI systems, which ultimately communicate with humans. Therefore, the responsibility falls on SCADA/HMI to ensure Part 11 compliance.
Regarding "Electronic Batch Records", PLCs have limited memory capacity and are not ideal for storing extensive historical data. It is typically the SCADA system that retains vast amounts of information. Even if PLCs were to store batch records over multiple years, data integrity becomes a critical concern in ensuring compliance with Part 11 regulations. 
An essential aspect of Part 11 involves maintaining an audit trail for electronic records to trace any alterations back to their source. The system must be secure from unauthorized tampering. The ideal Part 11 system operates similarly to an ATM, where transactions are secure, and access is restricted to authorized personnel.
Certain ambiguities persist in Part 11 compliance, such as the usage of tokens for electronic signatures. The FDA is yet to provide clear guidelines on whether both tokens must be entered for each transaction or if a single token suffices as acknowledgement. This uncertainty has left pharmaceutical companies and SCADA manufacturers grappling with the best approach.
Each pharmaceutical entity interprets Part 11 regulations differently, adding to the complexity of compliance. Ultimately, it is crucial to understand that no PLC can achieve full Part 11 compliance.</p>

            <p>I have experience creating PC-based programs that emulate PLCs for pharmaceutical packaging in a major company located in Roanoke, Virginia. This process focused on sealing the container surface, not the product itself. Unfortunately, I am unable to recall the specific company or specification you are inquiring about at this time.</p>

            <p>Terry Woods shared his experience of developing PC-based, PLC-Emulating programs for packaging in the Pharmaceutical industry, specifically focusing on container seal surface finishing. This project took place around 1999 when Part 11 was added to 21 CFR. If the packaging line required validation, it would likely fall under cGMP regulations. Many HVAC systems are now undergoing retro-validation due to their impact on product quality. Validation is crucial in ensuring that the product meets its intended specifications and functions correctly.</p>

            <p>I believe Allen's response was accurate. While PLC systems cannot achieve compliance with Part 11 regulations, it is the responsibility of the SCADA system to do so. Our company specializes in manufacturing packaging machines for the pharmaceutical industry, equipped with either a SCADA-type HMI or simpler interfaces like Siemens TP170 or Bradley PanelView. These systems all feature password protection, although our clients have deemed this to be sufficient without the need for usernames. Additionally, our machines undergo thorough validation processes, ranging from meeting 2000 compliance standards to considering various sensor failure scenarios. During acceptance inspections, our clients bring in experts from multiple fields, leaving me to handle their inquiries alone. Perhaps it is time to discuss a potential raise with my boss.</p>

            <p>PLCs and Compliance with 21 CFR Part 11

When it comes to PLCs, the software is classified as an electronic record according to FDA regulations. However, PLC Software currently lacks compliance in certain areas, such as the absence of an electronic audit trail for changes. PLCs and DCSs play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry by automating manufacturing processes, often without the use of SCADA or HMI systems.

To ensure compliance, GxP systems must undergo validation, implement security measures to restrict access to PLC code, and establish change control procedures. Regular software checks should be conducted to detect unauthorized changes, and maintaining previous software versions can aid in compliance efforts.

While there have been no FDA warning letters specifically targeting the use of PLCs, systems lacking adequate controls are at risk. SCADA systems and HMIs require separate assessments to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
