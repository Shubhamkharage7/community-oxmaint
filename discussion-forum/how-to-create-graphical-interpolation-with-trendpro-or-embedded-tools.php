                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am in need of creating a graphical representation that involves interpolating multiple variables, similar to the illustration shown above. I attempted to utilize the new XY function, but encountered difficulty achieving the desired outcome. The interpolation capability seemed limited to individual variables as their values changed. My objective is to establish connections between points such as P1 (X1/Y1), P2 (X2/Y2), P3 (X3/Y3), and so forth. Is there a method within trendpro or any embedded tool that can facilitate this process? Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>When using drbitboy as a reference for taking photos, each point on the Y-axis will have a set value for every Px. This means that P5 will consistently be located at (X, 5), P4 at (X, 4), and P3 at (X, 3). It is crucial to connect P5 to P4, P4 to P3, and so on.

It is not always a zig-zag pattern, as the points could form a straight line like P5(0,5), P4(1,4), and so on. Alternatively, the points could also be arranged in a different sequence like P5(0,5), P4(0,4), P3(0,3), P2(0,2), P1(4,1), and P0(5,0).</p>

            <p>In Functional TV (FTV), it is likely that objects exist with various properties such as position, length, color, and visibility, which could potentially be linked to tags. For example, when dealing with a line object, you may be able to connect the X coordinates of the lines to P0x, P1x, P2x, and so on. This allows for efficient manipulation and organization of visual elements within FTV.</p>

            <p>In his comment, drbitboy raised the point that objects in FTV have properties that can be tied to tags, such as position, length, color, and visibility. For example, for a line object, the X coordinates can be linked to P0x, P1x, P2x, etc. I concur with this idea and believe that values for Px can be paired with a constant "Y" value to animate lines with changing properties like width, visibility, and horizontal position. However, managing multiple lines with different properties like Zx and Vx could become cumbersome in the long run. I am exploring if Trend/TrendPro/TrendXY or other functions could offer a solution for this issue. Rockwell's release of "Radar Chart" in FTV14 has been helpful for some graphics, but I am still searching for an elegant solution for the interpolation needed in this case.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey mentioned the possibility of this being an interesting discussion thread where one might want to have popcorn at the ready. However, I believe it is feasible to address this issue without the necessary tools. For instance, in a Yokogawa system, they typically have a feature called "UserDefinedLineSegmentGraph" which could be used for this purpose. I am unsure if a similar functionality exists within the FTView tools, or if a more unconventional approach would be needed that may be difficult for others to comprehend.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey mentioned the possibility of having popcorn ready for this interesting discussion thread. I share the sentiment that this topic is worth watching. Another question directed towards @Cafofo: Can we expect all X values to be integers, such as 0, 1, 2, or 3? If so, there is a simple brute-force solution that could potentially simplify the process without overwhelming the HMI interface.</p>

            <p>In response to drbitboy's comment, I wholeheartedly agree. Another question for @Cafofo: Will the X values consist only of integers, such as 0, 1, 2, or 3? If so, a straightforward brute-force solution may be suitable (bearing in mind potential HMI limitations). However, the X values will actually be float values along the X axes.</p>

            <p>drbitboy inquired about the possibility of utilizing the XY Plot feature in FactoryTalk View SE for trending purposes. By using XY Plot, data points are plotted and interpolated with its own past, present, and future values. However, the specific requirement here is to interpolate the present value, P5, with the present value, P4, and so on.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In Cafofo's opinion, utilizing the XY Plot tool will not only plot the data points but also interpolate them between their "past," "present," and "future" values. However, the specific requirement in this case is to interpolate between the "present value" P5 and the "present value" P4, and so forth. It seems that the key feature is the ability to assign tags to individual coordinates on an XY Plot, allowing for versatile data visualization without the constraint of a time trend.</p>

            <p>Cafofo expressed doubt, stating that solving the issue without the right tools might be challenging. When mentioning popcorn instead of proper tools, we refer to the yellow kernels that pop into fluffy white pieces. Despite attempting to utilize the new XY function, it proved difficult to achieve the desired outcome. With no clear specifications provided, it becomes a guessing game to determine the solution. If we were in person, utilizing the HMI could have resolved the issue swiftly.</p>

            <p>To optimize the design, considering the limited five lines from P0 to P5 and a fixed Y-step from Pn to Pn+1 of 1, an alternative approach could be to create ten boxes drawing diagonal lines. Implement two boxes at each level, one with a diagonal from lower-left to upper-right, and the other from lower-right to upper-left. The Pnx tag's value can then be linked to the position of the lower corner where the line begins, while the difference between Pn+1x and Pnx can determine the width of the box. This method ensures a structured and visually appealing display.</p>

            <p>Instead of just a simple box, consider implementing a dynamic line animation feature in FactoryTalk View ME. This feature allows you to animate various properties such as horizontal and vertical positions, width, and height of shapes like circles. By linking your PnXtag values to the starting horizontal position of each line, you can create a more engaging and interactive user experience.</p>

            <p>Drbitboy pointed out an interesting observation: when selecting an XY Plot over a time Trend plot, it only allows for plotting points without connecting lines. This limitation has been a challenge, and exploring VBA solutions for trend analysis has not provided a clear answer.

Peter Nachtwey joked about confusion over popcorn and proper graphs. The lack of specificity in the requirements has made it difficult for others to assist effectively. Drbitboy suggested using a line instead of a box, similar to the Animation feature in FactoryTalk View ME. This approach could help tie PnXtag values to line positions.

While this solution seems promising, the scope of the issue extends beyond just P0 to P5. Utilizing FTView tools like Trend/TrendXY instead of animations may provide a clearer overview of the data in the long run, as excessive animations could lead to confusion in the future.</p>
