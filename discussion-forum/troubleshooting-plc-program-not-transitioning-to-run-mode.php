                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I'm currently facing a challenge and would appreciate some assistance. After updating my PLC program and transferring it to my controller, I encountered a problem when trying to run the program. Despite a successful download, the PLC remains in "STOP" mode and doesn't transition to "RUN" mode. I have a Allen-Bradley CompactLogix 1769-L24ER PLC and used Studio 5000 Logix Designer for the update. The changes I made include adding a new subroutine for additional sensor readings and some timer instructions. I have carefully reviewed the program for errors or typos and ensured all safety interlocks and necessary conditions are in place. Have you experienced a similar issue before? Could there be a hardware problem that I'm overlooking? Any insights or suggestions would be immensely helpful. Thank you in advance. Elena</p>

            <p>Attention Studio 5000 Logix Designer users! A product notice has been issued regarding a potential anomaly with versions V31 through V35 of the software. After downloading ladder diagram routines to certain controllers, such as ControlLogix 5580 and CompactLogix 5380, the routines may stop execution. The issue can be resolved by updating to software versions V33.02 and V34.02. For more detailed information and corrective measures, refer to Knowledgebase IDPN1620/1139086. Stay informed and keep your software up to date for optimal performance.</p>

            <p>In a forum discussion, jstolaruk noted that the 1769 series may not be covered in the product notice. Following their observation, another user suggested trying a possible fix based on personal experience with a similar issue. The suggestion involved switching the keyswitch to RUN mode from REM and power-cycling the PLC, as this workaround had worked on a different processor. It's worth a try for the original poster facing the problem, as sometimes the keyswitch commands may not always be followed accurately by the processor.</p>
