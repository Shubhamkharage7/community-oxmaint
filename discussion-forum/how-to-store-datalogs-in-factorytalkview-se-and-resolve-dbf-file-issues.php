                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I recently upgraded an application from RSView32 to FactoryTalkView SE, which led to a change in how datalogs are stored. Previously, the datalog was saved in a *.DBF file in RSView32 and a software generated reports in Excel from that file. However, in FactoryTalkView SE, datalogs are now saved in a *.DAT format, no longer supporting *.DBF files. I came across a solution in Rockwell's KnowledgeBase but am having difficulty implementing it. Has anyone encountered and successfully addressed this issue before?

            <p>The ODBC dBASE drivers are believed to originate from Office, particularly the "Jet Engine" on which MS Access is built. The Jet Engine used to be freely available for separate installation, and it still appears to be so. You can download the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable from the Official Microsoft Download Center. To check if the dBASE driver is installed, use the ODBC Administration Tool. Remember that a .DBF "database" is essentially a directory, with the tables being files within it.</p>

            <p>The instructions provided were adequate, but there were a few details missing. I followed the steps on a single computer, avoiding the need to transfer files between machines. One key action I took was creating a dedicated "database" folder to keep all files organized in one place, which proved essential for step #7 when saving DBF files in a specific location for easy access. Additionally, my version of Access no longer automatically generates .MDB files, so I had to utilize the "Save As" function and select the MDB format, opting for the 2002 version. In step #10, it is crucial to click the browse button next to each table to choose the DBF versions. Once I sorted out these details, I successfully logged into the DBF database.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: FAQs:</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> 1. What is the difference in how datalogs are stored between RSView32 and FactoryTalkView SE?
- In RSView32, datalogs were saved in a .DBF file, while in FactoryTalkView SE, datalogs are saved in a .DAT format.
  
2. How can I resolve the issue of transitioning from .DBF files to .DAT files in FactoryTalkView SE?
- You can refer to the solution provided in Rockwell's KnowledgeBase for guidance. Visit the link for more details: https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/69931/loc/en_US</p>
