                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello, everyone! First of all, I want to express my appreciation to Phil for the great update. The current situation is that I am mainly working from home due to the ongoing pandemic. When I'm not at the site (which accounts for about 10-15% of my time) or conducting Factory Acceptance Tests (5%) with clients, I am working remotely. Unfortunately, a tunnel I used to drive through daily has been closed post-pandemic, resulting in a long commute of 2h30-3h30 each day. Fortunately, my boss has allowed me to continue working remotely to retain me. 

As a result, I have a significant amount of PLC equipment at home, primarily for our laboratory testing devices. Recently, I brought home a new project Rockwell PLC rig and I started to feel a bit stressed with my daughters around it. The value of this equipment makes me anxious about keeping it uninsured in my car or at home. My boss also shared concerns about the potential risks to the project if anything were to happen to the equipment. 

Therefore, I have decided to return the equipment to the office and I am seeking the best way to set up an efficient workspace. Specifically, I need access to Rockwell PLC/Logix Designer and InTouch installations. Currently, I have separate VMs for each, and only one license for WW. Several years ago, we set up a similar setup on a server using a free VMware product for remote access collaboration with a team in Vancouver while I am in Montreal. I need to recreate this setup for remote access.

I still have access to the router at the office and can retrieve my NO-IP account if necessary. Additionally, I can re-host my VM licenses and activate them on a new installation. My goal is to have remote access to Studio 5000 and InTouch, along with the L82 and other devices on the network, using multiple screens. I prefer not to create a tunnel to poll the PLC from home and am apprehensive about using Team Viewer for remote control.

For those who work remotely, what solutions would you recommend in this situation?</p>

            <p>Throughout the years, I have shared various posts regarding this particular subject as I continue to be fascinated by the advanced technology that is now at our fingertips. On a daily basis, I find myself needing to offer remote assistance for equipment located in the field and provide FAT support. Within my company, I am the sole individual who possesses Studio 5000 software, despite residing a thousand miles away from the factory. Additionally, our equipment is dispersed globally. The ongoing challenge remains: "How can individuals on the receiving end assist me in connecting without the need for costly or invasive hardware/software installations on their end?" To address this, I employ VM VirtualBox on my computer to operate a minimal operating system (TinyCore Linux) for establishing the pipeline connection. Remarkably, all that is required from the end user is the installation of Java on their Windows PC, internet access, and an Ethernet connection. The internet connection can be facilitated through a facility WIFI (even a guest network) or a cell phone hotspot. An added advantage is that I can bypass the need for a VPN and gateway configuration.</p>

            <p>Although I don't have all the specifics, the software used was VMWare. Our organization utilized VMWare for remote collaboration with multiple employees working on projects through a shared server. This solution required expertise and a server-class machine, so it wasn't free. Rest assured, achieving your desired setup is feasible with the right tools and knowledge.</p>

            <p>I recently powered on my previous server, a VMWare ESXi 6.7, which was offered for free before the pandemic hit (unfortunately, I have misplaced the post-it note containing the complex root password). I am unsure if it has simply been rebranded as VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) 8.0U2 or if there are significant changes to the platform. Currently, I am researching pricing options, although I am not a fan of navigating through such websites.</p>

            <p>After digging through my old project notebooks, I had a sudden revelation. And just like that, the playing field is level.</p>

            <p>VMWare's Linux-based ESXi hypervisor is a valuable tool, especially for its free and low-spec versions. Many IT professionals prefer VMWare due to the high-performance virtual machine servers that ESXi allows them to build. However, the free ESXi version was recently affected by VMWare's acquisition by Broadcom, resulting in the discontinuation of free activation codes. Despite this, users can still install ESXi from previously downloaded versions.

In my office, I have a PLC test bench set up with an old PC running OpenWRT as a firewall and router connected to the Company network. I utilize ZeroTier to create secure tunnels to access the router from the Internet without using the Company VPN. Additionally, some computers are configured for wake-on-LAN to remotely start up the firewall. 

The test bench consists of a small 19" wheeled rackmount server rack with various devices attached, powered by a UPS and connected through a surplus 24-port switch. The ESXi server is located under my desk, allowing me to spin up guest operating systems as needed.

To access the ESXi hypervisor, I use the vSphere client, a Web browser, or VMWare Workstation. I have ZeroTier set up on each guest VM for remote access via Windows Remote Desktop. Another access point is an old Intel NUC running CloudReady, which enables me to log in remotely and use it as a local browser for tasks within the lab.</p>

            <p>There are easier methods available for setting up a VPN connection than the one I have described. If your company has an IT department capable of establishing a secure VPN connection with an endpoint in your laboratory, you can avoid the makeshift solutions I used to create tunnels into the lab.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach praised VMWare's Linux-based bare-metal ESXi hypervisor as an invaluable tool, especially the free and low-spec versions. Many IT professionals favored VMWare due to ESXi's no-cost option, enabling them to create high-performance virtual machine servers with advanced features. Unfortunately, the free ESXi version was impacted by Broadcom's acquisition of VMWare, leading to the discontinuation of free activation codes and simple perpetual licensing.

On a positive note, I was able to retrieve the old management console password and reactivate version 6.7. Transitioning a VM from VM17 to ESXi6.7 and uploading it to the server has not posed any compatibility challenges thus far. My main obstacle lies in deciphering the complex network connection settings, which were set up by someone else previously.

Regarding VPN, I believe the router at the office remains the same, so the settings should be intact. I just need to renew my No-IP account for seamless access. Using a "residential" router allows us to bypass the company network for IT purposes.

Similar to before, I will have a laptop with Team Viewer ready for remote console access if needed. Fingers crossed for a successful outcome.</p>

            <p>Ken Roach mentioned the importance of having reliable IT support, a luxury he has never had. He primarily uses his "office laptop" for AutoCAD Electrical due to the company servers hosting the Vault. However, after the company updated laptops to AutoCAD 2024, numerous issues arose. Despite seeking assistance from IT, including locked features and restricted software installation, the problems persisted. Eventually, a resolution was found through a Google search, highlighting the sometimes limited capabilities of traditional IT support. This experience has made Ken hesitant to rely on IT for setting up a VPN, as he values his independence and privacy.</p>
