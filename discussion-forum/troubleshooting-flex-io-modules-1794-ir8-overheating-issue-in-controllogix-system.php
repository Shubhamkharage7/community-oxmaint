                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>The ControlLogix CPU is linked to Flex IO through ControlNet. The Flex IO setup includes 5 modules: IB10X, OB6/AIE8, BIE4XOE2, and BIR8IR8. The two BIR8IR8 modules experience excessive heat, causing all inputs to read at full scale, whether connected to a field or not. Despite the Module OK LED indicating normal operation with a solid green light, the issue persists. When connected to the CPU via RSLogix, no problems are detected in the IO tree. Replacing the faulty modules allows the system to resume operation. This is an older installation that has been running for years, with two other Flex IO drops set up similarly but not experiencing the same problems. Even when the faulty modules are tested in a separate rack, the same issues arise. Given the recurring nature of this problem, further investigation is needed to determine the root cause.</p>

            <p>When troubleshooting issues with your system, it is important to verify the TB3 base wiring according to the manual 1794-IR8 and cross-reference it with the details provided in chapter 2. Additionally, be sure to address any "noise" coming from the 24V DC power supply to the modules. It is also worth checking for any AC interference on the field wiring to the RTDs. If the modules continue to exhibit the same behavior on both your test rig and field setup, it could indicate potential faults in the modules themselves. Be sure to thoroughly investigate and address points A and B mentioned above to ensure smooth operation.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When troubleshooting issues with your 1794-IR8 module, consider the following possibilities: 

1. Verify that the TB3 base wiring is correct by referring to the manual and double-checking against the details in chapter 2.
2. Check for any "noise" on your 24V dc supply that may be affecting the modules. It is also important to inspect for possible AC interference on your field wiring to the RTDs.
3. If the modules continue to exhibit the same behavior in both the test rig and field setup, they may be faulty. This could be due to a combination of incorrect wiring and electrical interference.

Additional details provided by DABA suggest that:
1. The wiring has not been changed and is part of an old installation that experiences intermittent failures.
2. Conducting a scope test on the DC supply may help identify any potential sources of noise.
3. Within a few months, there have been issues with 8 modules failing.
4. Temperature checks on faulty modules reveal significant differences when no inputs are connected versus with test resistors installed.

Considering the ongoing challenges, it may be necessary to return the modules to Rockwell for further analysis.</p>

            <p>Kellian mentioned that a ControlLogix CPU is connected to Flex IO via ControlNet. The Flex IO setup includes 5 modules: IB10XOB6, AIE8, BIE4XOE2, and BIR8IR8. However, the two IR8 modules tend to get very hot, causing all inputs to go to full scale, regardless of field connections. Despite the Module OK LED showing a solid green light (indicating normal functionality), the issue persists. When connected to the CPU through RSLogix, the IO tree shows no problems. Replacing the faulty modules temporarily resolves the issue, but it keeps recurring. This older installation has been in operation for years, with two other Flex IO drops configured similarly but not experiencing the same problem. Testing the faulted modules in a separate rack yields the same problematic results. It is crucial to identify and address the underlying cause of these recurring issues to ensure system stability and functionality.

Dear Kellian, I am encountering the same issue you described with the Flex IR8 modules. Interestingly, allowing the IR8 modules to sit disconnected for a few hours seems to temporarily resolve the problem. One IR8 module that initially appeared faulty miraculously started working again after some time. If you have found a solution to this issue, please share it with me. Your insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
