            <p>At this moment, I have a number of inquiries regarding maintenance and reliability practices. Firstly, how should intermittently used but critically important equipment be handled - are they considered hidden failures? Secondly, for systems with lead/lag equipment, what are the recommended schedules or procedures for rotation, and what specific questions should be asked? Additionally, when applying RCM logic, should adjustments be made to the analysis process for systems with redundancy that may result in "no scheduled maintenance" outcomes? Lastly, due to underloaded electrical panels and MCCs affecting IR thermography reports, is there a need to reevaluate the effectiveness of the current IR program and its value? As someone new to this field but tasked with establishing RCM and integrating PdM and PM programs, the unique challenges faced in this setting compared to a traditional manufacturing environment have proven to be quite puzzling. Any assistance or guidance on these matters would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>quote: 1. In our operations, there is a considerable amount of equipment that is only used intermittently but can be critical when required. Are these considered hidden failures? Yes, typically the first question in a logic analysis would inquire if the failure is apparent to the operator. If the answer is 'no,' then it is categorized as a hidden failure. However, there may be exceptions depending on the boundaries set. For example, focusing solely on the equipment may make malfunctions obvious to the operator. But if the analysis includes affected components, the failure might not be apparent until needed, making it a hidden failure. quote: 2. Many systems incorporate lead/lag equipment, raising questions about rotation schedules and procedures. What key inquiries should be made? Following the RCM logic, redundancy may lead to a majority of findings suggesting "no scheduled maintenance," which may not seem accurate. Should adjustments be made to the analysis process for these systems? Not necessarily, except ensuring appropriate lubrication and servicing, especially in cycling equipment. quote: 3. Due to the scenarios outlined in questions 1 and 2, our electrical panels and MCCs often lack sufficient load for meaningful IR thermography reports. While we have a well-established IR program for electrical components, concerns arise about the effectiveness of the efforts. Reports frequently show insufficient loading during inspections, casting doubt on the effectiveness of infrared technology. Perhaps motor diagnostics, resistance tests, or voltage drop tests would yield better results. Refer to my article, "Your Maintenance Program Is Effective... Isn't It?" in the inaugural edition of Uptime Magazine on page 32. Contact ReliabilityWeb at tohanlon@reliabilityweb.com if you need a copy of Uptime Magazine. Regards, Howard</p>

            <p>Dear Shelley, I respectfully disagree with the statements above, but acknowledge that I may not have all the necessary information. The discussion revolves around the classification of equipment failures as hidden or evident. It is essential to clarify that a hidden failure is one that is not immediately obvious to operators under normal circumstances. However, if the loss of function becomes evident as soon as the equipment is used, it should not be considered hidden.

In the context of intermittently used equipment, the key factor is whether the failure becomes apparent during regular operations. If the equipment is expected to be used periodically, then the failure would be evident and not hidden. In cases where the equipment is standby or part of a protective system, an additional failure would need to occur for it to be classified as hidden.

Understanding the distinction between hidden and evident failures is crucial in Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) decision-making. The RCM logic guides the determination of maintenance frequency and challenges traditional practices like fixed maintenance intervals. Ultimately, the focus is on finding the most cost-effective maintenance approach for failures with economic or operational implications.

When considering safety or environmental risks, the approach to maintenance may differ significantly. It is important to assess the rationale behind rotating equipment and avoid arbitrary practices like equal distribution of usage. Instead, a careful analysis of failure modes and maintenance costs over time is necessary to establish an optimal maintenance strategy.

In conclusion, a thoughtful and informed approach to maintenance planning, guided by RCM principles, can lead to improved equipment reliability and cost efficiency. It is crucial to move away from outdated practices and consider the unique characteristics of each piece of equipment to make informed maintenance decisions.</p>

            <p>Daryl emphasized the importance of thoroughly reviewing the explanation before providing feedback or quotations. It is crucial to include the entire statement in order to avoid misunderstandings, as there have been issues in the past. While there seems to be no disagreement, it is worth noting that running redundant equipment is not advisable. Neglecting to operate equipment such as electric motors and pumps can lead to degradation over time. Regular operation is necessary to maintain proper lubrication of bearings, exercise the insulation system, prevent material buildup in the impellor, and keep the seals in good condition. If all components of a pump were to fail or wear out simultaneously, the concept of tools like RCM would be redundant. This raises the question of whether RCM can be accurately utilized under such conditions. - Howard</p>

            <p>Howard, we have encountered this issue before, so please review the entire post before sharing your thoughts. Here is the complete excerpt of your statement, which still contradicts my own point. If you establish boundaries solely around the equipment, any malfunctions will be easily noticeable to the operator. However, including the affected components may not reveal the issue until it is necessary, making it a hidden failure. It is important to clarify that just because a failure is not immediately obvious does not make it hidden, as mentioned in the previous post. If the issue only becomes apparent after another failure occurs, it highlights the importance of addressing those components. Regarding your second point, it seems there may be a misunderstanding. I did not suggest avoiding rotation; rather, I argued against the 50/50 rotation method, which I believe is often impractical. While RCM can be effectively templated, there must be strict control over the process to ensure its realism. (However, this particular aspect is not being debated here).</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In assessing whether a function is evident or hidden to an operator during their regular duties, the timing of detection is not crucial. The key factor is whether the consequence coincides with the failure, regardless of when the operator becomes aware of it. If a second event, like a gas release or a pump malfunction, is needed for the operator to realize the consequence, then the function is considered hidden. To determine if a function is evident or hidden, simply ask if the consequence occurs simultaneously with the failure. This will provide clarity on the visibility of the function to the operator. - V.Narayan.</p>

            <p>Shelley, I trust that your Reliability Centered Maintenance project is moving forward as planned. I wanted to share a paper presented at RCM-2006 on "Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) in the Facilities Environment – New and Existing Buildings" by Alan K. Pride, Associate Director at the Smithsonian Institute. Mark your calendars for RCM-2007 in Honolulu from April 3-6! Aloha, Terry O.</p>

            <p>Dear Terry, 

I greatly appreciate the paper you provided! I have recently purchased the CD containing the proceedings from RCM 2006, and I am excited to delve into the various presentations it offers. Although the idea of attending next year's event in Honolulu may be a challenge to pitch to management, we will wait and see how things unfold. Our initial RCM analysis yielded positive results, and we are currently expanding our team through training initiatives and planning for upcoming projects. The high level of engagement and involvement from all organizational levels has been truly uplifting. An important lesson learned is the critical importance of involving operators and craftsmen throughout the RCM process. While cultural transformation may be a slow and arduous journey, I firmly believe that RCM is the ultimate tool to guide us in the right direction. I am grateful for resources like this website and the conferences that facilitate continuous learning and growth for all of us. 

Warm regards, 
Shelley</p>
