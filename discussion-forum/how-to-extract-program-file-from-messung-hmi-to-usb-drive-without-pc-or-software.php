            <p>I believe the HMI was produced by Beijers, who may have also created a version for Mitsubishi. While I found a manual for the HT series that could be similar, it doesn't mention the option to copy to USB. I have experience with Beijers HMIs, particularly the E series, where the application could only be uploaded using the ED.exe editor. If the HMI is password-protected, you won't be able to copy the application. For more information, you can refer to the MS-60T-PE HMI manual available through Bing's intelligent search engine. Bing's search feature helps you quickly locate the information you need.</p>

            <p>Initially part of the Hitech product line (PWS series), the H-T60 was rebranded and marketed under various brands before being acquired by Bejier and subsequently discontinued. The software program associated with this HMI device was known as ADP6.</p>
