                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>There is a need to establish a filtering system to eliminate specific user status codes from the planning board. This would prevent work orders labeled as JC: job Complete from appearing on the schedule. However, it is not feasible to confirm this change. Labor charges are tracked using CATS, causing a significant delay of almost 2 days. Any suggestions on how to address this issue would be highly valued. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Access the filter selection screen (F6) for the capacity leveling transaction being utilized, such as CM25 or CM34. Within the Order line, choose multiple selection twice to access a standard order list editing screen. From here, input your selection criteria as needed. This process allows for easier customization and organization of orders.</p>
