                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I received a compelling message from David Gleason after his conference presentation, discussing the "Inverse-Square Rule for Deferred Maintenance." This rule suggests that delaying maintenance on a failing part results in costs that are squared. Through focus group testing in various industries, participants used the "Inverse-Square Rule for Deferred Maintenance" Worksheets to calculate the total costs of breakdown events. The results consistently showed that the total costs, when square-rooted, equaled the cost of the primary failure part or deferred inspection. This rule is applicable to all maintenance types and sizes, helping organizations assess True Risk/Reward Ratio for Deferred Maintenance. By utilizing this rule, maintenance managers can accurately predict costs and man-hours needed for field applications. This tool aids in making informed decisions regarding operational and budgetary maintenance. For more information, visit The Geaslin Group's website at www.geaslin.com or www.ManagingMaintenance.com. Your feedback on the attached worksheet is highly appreciated.</p>
