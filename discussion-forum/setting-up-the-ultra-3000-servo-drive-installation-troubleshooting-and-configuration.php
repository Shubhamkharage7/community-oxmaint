                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Today, I was asked if I could set up a servo drive, specifically the Ultra 3000 model. While I have some experience with connecting these drives and troubleshooting fault codes, I wanted to do some research before committing. I have been studying the installation process, wiring, and input/output configurations. I have also looked into motor feedback options, including different encoders and external encoders. I feel confident in my abilities to handle the setup, but I do have a few questions. 

I am uncertain about the preferred commissioning method for the drive (D-net, discreet I/O, sercos, etc.) and what interface software is necessary in addition to Ultraware. It is not feasible to use another controller as there are 5 Ultra 3000 drives available, and it is unlikely that they are compatible with the "PAC" platform of AB controllers. 

The goal is to use the servo drive for material feeding at a specific rate, although the input method for this data is unclear. Additionally, the drive may need to reverse for a brief period, stop, and then resume feeding. 

I am unsure if Ultraware is a free download or if it requires a purchase. Is there a sample file available for me to review and better understand the setup process?

This project is new to me, but I enjoy the challenge it presents. I welcome any feedback or advice on this task. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for an activation for the Ultraware software, I don't have it. However, I don't see any reason why I can't share the software with you. In some customer locations, the software is often found on a CD tucked away at the bottom of the control panel, almost as if it came with the drive itself. Just send me a private message if you need it. 

I haven't done much beyond installing the software from the CD and connecting to a drive to upload parameters and save them to the hard drive. It was a straightforward process.</p>

            <p>Consider investing in Ultraware's P/N 2098-UWCPRG, priced at around $75. Many users on this platform, including myself, have experience working with the Ultra 3000. Feel free to post any questions you may have, and we'll assist you. If you have the basic indexing drive, you'll need additional setup. The Sercos version is compatible only with Controllogix PLCs, while the Devicenet version requires specific network wiring and RSNetworx for configuration. Opting for the basic indexing drive with discrete I/O (part number ending in X) is the simplest solution for your application. Simply configure motion profiles in Ultraware, connect I/O to your PLC, and you're good to go.</p>

            <p>To set up your system properly, you will also require a programming cable with the Part Number 2090-UXPC-D0903. While a null modem cable may suffice, it's best to confirm this. Once Ultraware is installed, you can choose to either access an offline drive file with a .udb extension or monitor the connected drive online. Make sure you have all the necessary literature available by visiting the following links:

1. http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/in/2098-in003_-en-p.pdf
2. http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/in/2098-in005_-en-p.pdf
3. http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/um/2098-um001_-en-p.pdf

Ensure a smooth setup process by obtaining the essential programming cable and literature resources.</p>

            <p>When using a sercos module, there is no need for ultraware software. Instead, you can easily configure it in logix. However, if you are using a 2-axis servo like the 1756-MO2AE, you will require ultraware to set up the drive properly. Setting up the drive with ultraware involves specifying the motor or actuator being used, configuring I/O settings, and selecting the operation mode. To simplify the process, consider using an Allen Bradley actuator to easily choose from a list of part numbers instead of creating a custom motor profile for a different brand. Additionally, communication with the MO2AE is simplified as it uses an analog signal for control. For further assistance, searching for the RSTrainer for motion DVD can provide valuable guidance for your project.</p>

            <p>To communicate with these servo drives, all you need is a null modem cable. I have had great success using either the 1756-CP3 or 1746-CP3 cables along with a gender bender. Connect with ease and efficiency using this setup. Alan</p>

            <p>Thank you all for the valuable responses and guides. The Controller - 2098-DSD-010X and Motor - N-3406-2-H00AA have been instrumental in setting up the system. By the way, Ultraware is available for free and can be accessed through this link: http://www.rockwellsoftware.com/support/download/detail.cfm?ID=3655

I have successfully completed the wiring and installation, but I just need a "gender bender" to finalize the communication link. I will obtain one tomorrow. The application requires the motor to oscillate back and forth at 2000RPM with minimal stall before changing directions. The speed and distance will be preset during the "tweaking period" and will not require any user input once set. It is preferred to operate the system "stand alone", without any I/O. I may need to incorporate a timer relay to delay the enable signal while the driver starts up.

I am considering whether a reversing signal and a home sensor are required. Some sources mention an absolute signal for the motor, which may eliminate the need for a home sensor as the servo should know its position upon power up. I will explore this further once I have the adapter in hand. Your continued support is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Thanks for mentioning Ultraware - I had no idea it was a free download from Rockwell. It's interesting how their online catalog still shows it as a purchased item. With the Ultra software, you have the ability to perform both absolute and incremental moves. Incremental moves start from the current position without needing the servo to be homed, while absolute moves reference the home position, which must be set each time the drive is powered on. Home position can be established using a sensor connected to a digital input or by using a current limit method (gradually moving the motor load to a hard stop). It's important not to mix up absolute positioning (supported by Ultra) with an absolute encoder (which as far as I know, Ultra does not support). The motors I have used with Ultras typically have incremental encoders that do not retain their position after power cycles. I don't have experience with the N-series motors. I believe one of the digital outputs can be configured for a function like "drive ready", eliminating the need for a timer to delay the enable signal. Additionally, you can set up one of the motion indexes to automatically start when the drive is enabled, which may be the solution you are seeking.</p>

            <p>If you're considering a standalone system without any I/O capabilities, the 3000 may not be the best option for you. You might want to explore the Ultra 5000 instead, which offers advanced programming features and is designed to operate independently. Additionally, the 3000i has the ability to perform a series of indexing moves efficiently. Consider these factors when making your decision.</p>
