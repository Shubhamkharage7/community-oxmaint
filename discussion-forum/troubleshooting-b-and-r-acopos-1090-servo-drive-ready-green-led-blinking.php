            <p>Have you encountered the issue of the servo drive Acopos 1090 showing a blinking GREEN LED? If you're unable to find the error in the manuals, don't worry, I can help. By using B&R Automation Studio to communicate with the Acopos 1090, you can pinpoint the error code: 7210 DC Bus: Charging: Voltage unstable. To resolve this issue, consider changing the capacitor value to 0.033uF/275Vac. The Acopos 1090 is designed to connect to a 3-phase input. For further assistance, feel free to reach out via email at [email protected]</p>

            <p>Successful Repair - Thank You!kp2009 said: Hi, I apologize for my limited English proficiency. I utilized B&R Automation Studio for communication with Acopos 1090 and encountered error code 7210 DC Bus: Charging :Voltage unstable. The solution was to adjust the Capacitor value to 0.033uF/275Vac. For those facing a similar issue, be sure to check the capacitance. If needed, you can replace the capacitor. Acopos 1090 is designed to be connected to a 3 phase input. For any further assistance, you can reach me via email at [email protected] Click here to learn more. 

Thank you for sharing this valuable information! It successfully addressed our issue with the same drive. The symptom we faced was the Green LED on the drive continuously blinking. Following the recommendation, we replaced all three (3) noise suppression caps. As a result, the drive now starts up smoothly and operates steadily once again. For those looking to purchase these capacitors, they are available at DigiKey Electronics. Thank you for the assistance and guidance. Dave from Minneapolis can be reached at [email protected] Thank you once again for your support!</p>

            <p>Hello, I have found that the capacitor in my driver unit is actually 1uF/400VAC, not 0.033uF as originally stated. I removed the capacitor and measured it with an LCR meter, which showed values of 0.689uF for two of the capacitors and 0.989uF for the third. Can you please advise if these readings are acceptable, or if there may be another issue with the PCB that needs to be addressed? Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello, when looking at the junction where the 3 phases from the lower board connect to the main power board, you will notice small resistor chains leading to 3 grey capacitors with adhesive on top. Directly above them is a large grey capacitor, and above that is the power block/heatsink. The issue likely lies with one of the capacitors that have failed, as they are responsible for reducing the AC line voltage to a lower level for rectification and monitoring by the control card. These capacitors should have a measurement of 33nF, but commonly drop to around 6nF when faulty. If you are in need of industrial repair services, please contact me at [email protected] Thank you.</p>

            <p>Dear Friend, it seems that the gray color capacitors you mentioned are actually 1uf/400v, not 33nf. Could this mean that the capacitor has failed? Upon measuring with the LCR meter, 2 of the capacitors showed a reading of 0.689uf, while one showed 0.989uf, indicating a tolerance issue. This suggests that approximately 45% of the capacitor values have failed. Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Ensure you are examining the correct capacitor, as any inaccuracies in measurement indicate a faulty component. Polyester capacitors are expected to be highly precise and should measure up to their labeled values. The three capacitors in question can be found on the large PCB beneath the heatsink, distinct from the long narrow board secured to the main board with screws and housing multiple capacitors.</p>

            <p>If you notice the Run light flashing green on your drive, it typically indicates either a lack of input power or a false enable input. It's a common pattern that can prevent faults from occurring, but attempting to run the drive in this state may lead to issues. Make sure the power is turned on and the enable input is accurate before replacing capacitors.</p>

            <p>Experiencing Green Light Blinking Issue on ACOPOS 1022: Help Needed

Hello everyone,

I recently encountered the common issue of the green light blinking on my ACOPOS 1022. Despite changing the three 0.033uf caps, the problem persists. I noticed error codes 4005 and 9002, which are proving to be quite frustrating.

I have tried replacing the optocoupler after the diode bridge, but to no avail. Has anyone else faced this issue and found a solution? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help in advance!

Best regards,David</p>
