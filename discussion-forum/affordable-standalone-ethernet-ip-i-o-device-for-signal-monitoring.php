In my opinion, the process was relatively straightforward and hassle-free.</p>

Finding a unicorn in the form of a cheaper alternative seems unlikely, as similar options like the Clicks have their own drawbacks. Considering the expenses involved in engineering, building enclosures, and purchasing materials, it may be more cost-effective to opt for a 1732E or similar product instead.</p>

            <p>I have utilized two Click Plus modules as I/O for a CompactLogix system, and the results have been fantastic. One of the modules is being used for Modbus RTU control of two Yaskawa GA800 VFDs, enabling seamless communication of control and status information via the EIP link. This setup was especially useful as the EIP module from Yaskawa was not easily accessible at the time. Additionally, the Click module efficiently handles the integration of a couple of analog inputs from the panel.</p>

In that case, using the regular Click as a client may be sufficient.</p>

            <p>The Click module is an ideal solution for cost-effective Ethernet/IP remote I/O applications. While I have utilized it successfully multiple times for this purpose, one challenge is the lack of a built-in feature for conducting a thorough communication check to guarantee that the outputs will deactivate in the event of a disconnection from the main PLC. This means that you may need to forego the simplified mapping highlighted in instructional videos in order to achieve this functionality.</p>
