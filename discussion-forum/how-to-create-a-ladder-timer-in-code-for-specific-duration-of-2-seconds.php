                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hey everyone, I'm facing a challenge with a seemingly simple question that I've managed to overcomplicate. I have a variable named "light" that I need to remain illuminated for a specific duration of 2 seconds after both Condition1 and Condition2 are met. These conditions will only be true for a short period, so I want the light to stay on for the full 2 seconds following their initial activation, regardless of any subsequent changes in their status. If either Condition1 or Condition2 become true again while the light is still on, I need it to remain illuminated. How can I achieve this functionality in my code? This is my current approach.</p>

            <p>Can you identify the platform being used in this scenario? Some observations and questions have arisen. Firstly, is the -|P|- instruction signaling a pulse? Additionally, is the -(S)- instruction a "SET" command that activates the HoldLight? It seems that TON is functioning as an on-delay timer, with its Q turning on once the timing is complete.

In the event that the timer is not running, either Moderate or HighIntensity will trigger the HoldLight and initiate the timer, which will subsequently expire. The LightHoldTimer.Q instruction will remain inactive due to the deactivation of the |P| instructions and the absence of a reset command for the HoldLight.

It might be beneficial to incorporate an off-delay timer triggered by the |P| pulse. While the TOF.Q is active, the light remains illuminated. Please note that the analysis is primarily applicable to AB PLCs, specifically models 5, 500, and 5000. If your platform differs significantly, outcomes may vary.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If either Condition 1 or 2 becomes true again while the light remains illuminated for 2 seconds, the desired outcome is for the light to stay on continuously. The key concern here is the repetition of trigger conditions within the two-second interval of the light being on. Should Condition 1 or 2 be met while the light is still on from a previous event, do you wish for the two-second countdown to restart? In simpler terms, should the light remain on during any scan cycle where either Condition is met, as well as for an additional 2 seconds after the last scan cycle where a Condition transition occurred? If the answer is yes, then the Timer OFF-delay (TOF) instruction, as suggested by @joseph_e2, is ideally suited for this scenario. The TOF logic aligns perfectly with the described requirements and can be implemented using just three instructions on a single rung.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Give this a go - the contacts with an up arrow function the same way as your "P" contacts. The initial rung acts as a reset for the timer, ensuring that if either trigger happens again, it won't activate unless the latch is off first. The "P" contacts reset in just one scan before moving on to the next scan, ensuring that it only happens once the latch has been set. When the triggers first pulse, the latch is enabled for the timer to start counting. The latch is then reset once the timer reaches its end. The timer will run on the latch for two seconds, but if another trigger pulse occurs, it resets and keeps the latch (light) on for an additional two seconds.</p>

            <p>In search of a solution, users discussed using an off-delay timer triggered by a pulse and the Timer Off-Delay (TOF) instruction. The TOF logic was lauded for its simplicity, requiring only three instructions on a single rung. One user recommended a reset for the timer using triggers similar to the "P" contacts, allowing for the timer to reset if the latch is off before the next scan. This latch procedure, along with the TOF method, proved to be effective solutions. Thank you to all for the assistance!</p>
