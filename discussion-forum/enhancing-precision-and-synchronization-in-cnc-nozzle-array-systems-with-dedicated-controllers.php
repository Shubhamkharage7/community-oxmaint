                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings everyone,

I am currently engaged in a project that entails managing a set of nozzles in a CNC environment. These nozzles move along a linear trajectory at a consistent speed and angle. The main goal is to activate all nozzles simultaneously along a line perpendicular to their path (refer to the image). This control is executed through G-code for motion commands and M functions for toggling the nozzles on/off.

The main challenge I am encountering is achieving precise synchronization between the motion of the nozzles and their activation/deactivation, particularly considering the inherent delay in the hardware's response time. At present, the nozzles are moving at a speed of 500 mm/s, with the PLC system functioning at a cycle time of 1 ms. This configuration limits the system's accuracy to about 0.5 mm, directly related to the PLC's cycle time.

Given these limitations, I am considering whether switching to a dedicated controller with a faster cycle time could be a viable solution. I would greatly appreciate your input on the following queries:

- Viability: Is adopting a dedicated controller with a faster cycle time a feasible method to improve accuracy in this context? Have you implemented a similar solution in your own practice?
- Recommendations: If a dedicated controller is recommended, are there specific models or brands that suit these criteria well? Keep in mind there are 24 individual nozzles in the array.
- Alternatives: Alternatively, are there other methods or technologies you would propose exploring to tackle the synchronization and accuracy issues without necessitating a switch to a different controller?

I am eager to hear your opinions, experiences, and any guidance you can offer on enhancing the efficiency of such a system. Thank you in advance for your assistance and insights!</p>

            <p>What is the optimal resolution needed for achieving the best response times when activating a nozzle? Additionally, what is the noise level associated with these response times? It is worth noting that cos(α) can be substituted with √(nP2- 1S2) / nP to streamline function calls.</p>

            <p>Drbitboy inquired about the necessary or preferred resolution and the noise level associated with response times when activating a nozzle. He also asked about the best achievable resolution. Additionally, he mentioned that cos(α) could potentially be substituted with √(nP2- 1S2) / nP to streamline calculations.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. The response time of the nozzles is 6 milliseconds to activate and 8 milliseconds to deactivate. The CNC controller has the capability to pre-call M-functions, allowing for effective management of delays. However, the challenge arises when increasing nozzle density (or reducing niD in the diagram), as this may result in multiple calls within the same cycle. With the current dimensions of the effectors and motion profile taken into consideration, the ideal cycle time to avoid this issue would fall within the range of 10-100 microseconds.</p>

            <p>Determining whether the equipment is a standard product or a customized machine is crucial in determining the level of investment needed. Coordinating the movement of 24 or more nozzles is a manageable task, but the challenge lies in achieving precise timing for turning them on and off. It seems that specialized hardware is necessary to achieve the level of accuracy desired in controlling the nozzles based on their location. How consistent is this process? Can the timing for the nozzles be programmed into a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)?</p>

            <p>We have a unique prototype that is a one-of-a-kind creation, with both budget and time allocated for its development. I understand the challenge lies in efficiently managing the nozzles. Currently, I am utilizing M-functions within the CNC controller to handle this task. This approach minimizes the computational load during operation, yet I foresee difficulties when expanding the system to control more densely packed nozzle arrays. Exploring the use of FPGAs seems promising and worth investigating. When it comes to correlating the nozzle status with the current TCP location, the crucial aspect will be determining the tolerance level for identifying whether the nozzle is ON or OFF. In this case, would you consider storing the "bitmap" in the internal memory of the FPGA card and using the position vector (x,y,a) as input?</p>
