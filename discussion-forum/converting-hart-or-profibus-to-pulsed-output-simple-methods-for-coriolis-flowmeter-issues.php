                    <p>Greetings,
I am currently dealing with a malfunctioning Coriolis flowmeter on a filler machine. The filler specifically requires a pulsed output, and unfortunately, the manufacturer is unable to modify the program. Is there a simple method to convert other protocols such as Hart or Profibus to a pulsed output for this situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Jason.</p>

            <p>It's a bit unclear. Can you provide more details about your issue? It sounds like you were using a flow meter that gave a pulsed output based on the flow measurement, such as one pulse per X gallons, for a filler machine. What exactly are you looking to achieve by replacing the flow meter with a different device? I am unsure about your protocol query. Have you considered simply swapping the current flow meter with another one that also gives a pulsed output?</p>

            <p>Robertmee inquired for further clarification, mentioning that the issue was unclear. It seems like there was a flow meter that generated a pulsed output based on measured flow, but there is a need to replace it with a different device. The protocol question raised was not understood, and the suggestion was to replace the flow meter with another one that provides a pulsed output. Hello Robert,Thank you for your input. The original flow meter malfunctioned, and the cost of a new replacement is $20,000. However, there are numerous surplus flow meters available with protocols like Hart and Profibus, but they lack the pulsed option. These surplus flow meters are priced at around $1,500, but do not meet the pulsed signal requirement of my filler PLC.Kind regards,Jason</p>

            <p>What is the highest flow rate (measured in lb/s, tons/day, etc.) and how much mass does each pulse represent? If the solution is too complex, the expenses associated with designing and implementing it may exceed the cost of a new Coriolis meter.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>When determining the maximum flow rate in pounds per second or tons per day, it is important to also consider the mass represented by each pulse. If the solution becomes overly complex, the associated design and implementation costs may outweigh the affordability of a new Coriolis meter. Thank you for your insight. The 1-inch dosimeter that recently malfunctioned was measuring water, with each pulse representing 1 milliliter of water. The filler is currently filling 10 liters, with a Siemens PLC managing the process.</p>

            <p>Inquiring about the preferred level of accuracy? Opting for a magflow meter over a Coriolis one may sacrifice some precision, but prioritize repeatability. Aim to stay within a 50ml margin for a 10-liter measurement.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>JJones.tas recorded a pulse rate of 2222Hz, with a peak pulse rate potentially higher due to the filler algorithm slowing down at the end. This measurement of 10L of 1mL pulses in 4.5 seconds is unusually high, making it challenging to convert low-frequency rate measurements with noise to pulses. Many protocols may not accommodate such a high measurement interval, leading to potential difficulties in accurately measuring pulse rates in certain scenarios.</p>

            <p>drbitboy mentioned a pulse rate of 2222Hz for 10L of 1mL pulses in 4.5 seconds. If the filler algorithm slows down, the peak pulse rate will be even higher. Most protocols may not offer such a high measurement interval, making the conversion of low-frequency rate measurements to pulses a challenging task. Protocol conversion involves overhead and a time delay, which is why the 20k instrument was implemented. Engineering time and missed opportunities come with a cost, so it's best to stick with what has been proven to work.</p>

            <p>Robertmee is in agreement with Drbit regarding protocol conversion, noting the inherent time delay and overhead involved.

Your prompt assistance is greatly valued.</p>
