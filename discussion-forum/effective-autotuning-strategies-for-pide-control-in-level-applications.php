            <p>The concept of level control processes differs significantly from the processes that auto tune is intended to address, causing auto tune to struggle or even fail when applied to a level control system. 

In a flow control system, increasing the pump speed output from 50% to 60% leads to a rise in pump outlet pressure and flow. This results in a shift in equilibrium towards a new stable flow rate, with the system settling at around 120% of the initial flow rate. Stability is crucial in this type of system, which is what autotune algorithms are optimized for.

On the other hand, when dealing with a level control system, increasing the pump speed output causes the level to rise due to a net accumulation of liquid in the tank. Unlike the flow control system, there is no equivalent mechanism to counteract the imbalance between inlet and outlet flows, leading to continuous rise in the level as long as the tank has capacity. Autotune algorithms are not tailored to address the challenges posed by such unstable systems.</p>

            <p>I have never utilized the PIDE controller, let alone the autotune feature. However, it is crucial to recognize that, unless this system is unique, it will function as a Type 1, or single integrating, system for level control. Without informing the autotuner of this fact, it may struggle to generate an appropriate gain setting. It appears that I am a slow typer.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In analyzing control processes, it is crucial to recognize the distinction between level control systems and processes that can be optimized using auto-tuning algorithms. Auto-tune algorithms excel in stabilizing equilibrium in systems like flow controllers, where adjustments lead to predictable outcomes. These algorithms are adept at fine-tuning systems to find a stable equilibrium point.

Contrastingly, when dealing with level control systems, the dynamics are different. Imagine a scenario where a level controller is on manual mode with the pump speed set at 50%, and the level is stable. Any increase in pump speed to 60% will lead to a continuous rise in the level due to the net accumulation of liquid in the tank. Unlike flow control systems, there is no equivalent mechanism to balance out the accumulation in a level control system, resulting in an unstable system.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the specific characteristics of each type of control system when applying autotune algorithms. While autotune algorithms are effective in optimizing flow control systems, they are not suitable for stabilizing level control systems with inherent instability.</p>

            <p>While some may consider me traditional or old-fashioned, the PID block has been my go-to for achieving reliable level control for many years. Although I typically work with 1000 gallon tanks that don't require an extremely tight deadband, I have found success using the Ziegler-Nichols method for level tuning.

            <p>When running the autotune, it is important to ensure a stable process. What specific control performance are you aiming for? Are you seeking tight level control at or near the setpoint, or is the level measurement utilized to mitigate fluctuations in the outflow? AMarks95 mentioned having the PIDE mode set to reverse acting, which can be a confusing term without additional context.

The Allen-Bradley manual for PIDE does not provide a clear definition of reverse acting. It simply states that the ControlAction parameter can be set to either true (PV - SP) or false (SP - PV). Are you using a true or false value for the PID ControlAction parameter?

Consider how the process is controlled. Does an increase in PIDE output CV result in opening a valve, adjusting a flowrate setpoint, increasing flow, or raising pump speed? Conversely, does decreasing CV result in valve closure, lowering a setpoint, reducing flow, or slowing down the pump? And how does CV affect flow, whether it's the inbound flow into the vessel or the outbound flow from the vessel?</p>

            <p>When running the autotuning process with the Logix controller and PIDE block, it is essential to consider the control performance objectives. Are you aiming for tight level control near the setpoint, or is the vessel's level measurement intended for surge attenuation purposes to stabilize outflow fluctuations?

The term "reverse acting" can be confusing without proper context. In the Allen-Bradley manual covering PIDE, the Control Action parameter can be set to true for Error calculation as PV - SP, or false for Error calculation as SP - PV. It is crucial to specify the Control Action parameter value to ensure accurate control of the process.

In the case of level control, adjusting the PIDE output CV will impact the pump speed, influencing the tank level accordingly. Setting Control Action to reverse acting (E = PV - SP) means that increasing the CV output will decrease the tank level by increasing the pump speed.

For successful autotuning of level control using PIDE, consider setting CVProg to maintain a constant level before initiating the tuning process. Observing changes in the tank level after the autotuner applies the CV Step can provide valuable insight into the control performance. Experimenting with different settings and techniques can help improve the results of the autotuning process specifically tailored for level control applications.</p>

            <p>In a discussion thread, AMarks95 mentioned that the ControlAction for the system is set to E = PV - SP (reversed from the default setting). When the CV output is increased, the pump speed increases, ultimately leading to a higher flow rate from the vessel. Questions to consider include the vessel's shape (straight sides or cylindrical with a horizontal axis), dimensions, and the desired quantitative level control (such as 5ft above the tank's bottom ±6inch). It's important to determine the maximum and minimum flow rates achievable by the outlet pump at specific CV values, as well as the expected minimum and maximum inlet flow rates. Additionally, understanding the dynamic nature of the inlet flow rate is crucial, including the anticipated short-term changes and the timeframe over which they occur.</p>

            <p>Several insightful comments have been made in the discussion. I am experienced in designing various auto tuners that require a customized model for each specific system they are intended for. As stated by Kieth, tank level control is an integrating system that balances the in-flow and out-flow variances. It is essential to clarify whether the pump controls the in-flow or out-flow, as this determines the necessary control settings - a negative or reverse acting gain. Speed control and temperature control systems operate differently as non-integrating systems. In contrast, position control and tank level control function as integrating systems. Pressure control can vary depending on the specific system in use.

Now, the crucial question arises - why is a PID controller essential? Unless precise control of the level is required, a simple proportional band and SCP block can suffice. The level will be maintained within the band without the need for extensive details, except for ensuring the pump can adjust for maximum in-flow or out-flow.</p>

The key question raised is why a PID controller is necessary for precise level control, with a simple proportional band likely sufficient. AMarks95 emphasized the need to maintain a constant tank level setpoint. Feel free to share your thoughts, Mr. Nachtwey, we value your input.</p>

The concept of KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is understood, and it's known that level control can be achieved with an SCP instruction. However, this method may not be as engaging as the OP desires.

What the OP truly requires is a straightforward solution. In a video, drbitboy demonstrates how they adjust for different container shapes. While they understand the technical aspects, simplicity is key. Providing simple control is their expertise and they are confident in their ability to control various factors.

It's important to acknowledge that while some things may be controllable, it may not always be practical.

            <p>Peter Nachtwey inquired: WHY IS A PID CONTROLLER NECESSARY? When utilizing PID auto-tune, individuals are unable to formulate a closed-loop equation, resulting in a lack of understanding of the closed-loop integrator with a proportional in the feedback leading to a first-order lag. This presents the question of why PID is deemed essential. The need for a PID controller, as opposed to a P-only controller or PI controller, depends on various factors such as volumes, flows, actuator velocity, and level deadband. Despite the complexities of PID tuning, level control remains a straightforward concept in the realm of control systems. Peter Nachtwey's insights shed light on the importance of understanding PID controllers in the context of closed-loop systems.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, DrBitBoy inquired about the connection between PID autotuning and specific controller tuning techniques. When manually tuning a PI controller, it is important to adjust the proportional (kp), integral (ki), and derivative (kd) parameters effectively. To achieve optimal results, start by setting ki and kd to zero, then gradually increase kp until the desired outcome is attained. If the system is not responding as expected, adjust ki while ensuring it does not exceed 0.1 times kp. It is recommended to initially set ki to kp multiplied by 10^-4 for optimal performance. Keep in mind that these steps should be approached cautiously and with attention to detail for successful tuning.</p>

            <p>As a retiree, I recently rediscovered a fascinating piece in my old files - the Desaireator tank. Operating at a temperature of 250 °C, this tank was crucial in the distillation process of palm oil. Despite not utilizing radar technology, the tank functioned flawlessly for over a decade. The oil level was monitored using a pressure device, and oil was directed into the tank through a valve and pump or a vfd pump. The outflow of oil was regulated by another PIDE system in conjunction with a flowmeter and vfd pump.</p>

            <p>Peter Nachtwey confidently stated that he hasn't come across a situation he can't handle. This level of control is truly impressive and makes me wonder if you have any siblings, particularly sisters, who may test that statement. Despite this, I found your video to be valuable as it has ignited my interest in learning more about PID systems.</p>

            <p>WhinnieThePooh commented, expressing admiration and suggesting that the individual may not have any sisters based on their knowledge of PID systems. Despite this, they found the video informative and acknowledged that there is still much to learn about PID systems.

One key aspect to consider is the open loop transfer function for systems without sisters. System identification may not work as expected, as these systems may not respond well to being measured. When dealing with a tank, the gain is determined by the surface area of the tank and the pump's response time. The integrator time constant should be selected in a way that ensures disturbances are corrected within 5 integrator time constants.

In the scenario where a pump is moving 1 cubic meter per minute in a tank with a surface area of 10 square meters, the level will change by 0.1 meter per minute. Calculating the gain of the pump and ensuring control results in the desired level change are crucial. The open loop transfer function for the pump and tank is Kpump/(area*s), making gain calculations straightforward without the need for autotuning.

Different systems can be categorized as non-integrating or integrating, with varying numbers of open loop poles. Auto tuning can play a crucial role in identifying the best model for a system based on its specific characteristics. While some PLCs are designed for FOPDT or SOPDT systems, there is a wide range of potential models to consider for optimal system performance.</p>

            <p>In response to the query by drbitboy about loop update times and PID execution control, it is crucial to consider factors such as flow rates, vessel size, and configuration. These elements play a key role in determining the effectiveness of configuring a PID instruction. Moreover, these aspects are often mishandled, leading to inaccuracies in the system.

Maxk's inquiry about the relevance of loop update times and PID execution control to PID autotuning is insightful. Understanding how these questions tie in with the autotuning process is essential for optimal system performance.

An important aspect of configuring PID autotuning is selecting a suitable loop update time and ensuring that the PID instruction executes once per loop update time. Failure to do so can compromise the accuracy of the PID instruction and affect overall system functionality. 

Amarks95 highlighted the need for clarification on specific queries related to autotuning in posts #9 and #17. Addressing these questions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the autotuning process.

When configuring autotune settings, users have the option to select the process model and other parameters. The autotune algorithm then adjusts the control variables, collects data on the process variable's response, fits this data to the chosen model, and determines tuning parameters accordingly.

The user-defined PID loop update time and the PLC program's execution scheme significantly impact the quality of collected process variable data. Inadequate loop update times or insufficient PID loop updates during autotuning may result in inaccurate or noisy data, leading to poor model fits and suboptimal system performance.

Lastly, it is important to quantitatively assess any qualitative statements regarding the autotune algorithm's performance. Understanding the specific issues, such as slow responses or excessive oscillations, can help improve the autotuning process and enhance overall system efficiency.</p>
