            <p>When teaching mechatronics in a community college, we were encouraged to utilize Servo drives like the Allen Bradley 5100. However, after downloading and running KNX5100C, we found it to be quite complex. I was hoping for a simpler way to program positions, speeds, forward, and reverse, similar to a VFD. Are there any other Allen Bradley software options available for programming servos? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, the Allen Bradley 5100 is a budget-friendly option suitable for standalone use, despite the complexity of the KNX5100C software. You can easily connect it using a USB cable. Unlike other drives, it allows for Auxiliary encoder feedback for precise slippage checking without the need for a PLC and additional programming. If interested in newer Allen Bradley servos, they are all integrated into Studio 5000. Consider exploring Automation Direct servos for a cost-effective solution that can be programmed with a PLC. As for the 5100, controlling it through AOI in Studio 5000 is possible. These AOI provide basic functionalities like MAM, MAJ, MAS, but do not include a motion axis. Downloadable AOI can be found on Rockwell's website for easy integration.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Ian, for getting us started on this project. As we continue to make progress, I am considering creating a YouTube video to share our success. While we are utilizing Studio 5000 for now, I am now thinking about using Automation Direct servos instead. Their Click software and control software have received positive feedback for being user-friendly and effective.</p>

            <p>Hello Ian & team,
My students and I have been experimenting with the Kinetix 5100 and the KNC standalone software. While we have been making progress, we need assistance in connecting our digital I/O to the 5100. Can someone provide information on the specific type of connector required for the digital I/O? I initially thought it was a SCSI-2 cable with 50 pins, but the one I ordered does not fit. I prefer not to use the breakout board from rockwell due to its fragile appearance. Any insights on this connector would be highly valuable. Unfortunately, I could not find detailed information in the product manual.
For more information on the Kinetix 5100, please visit: https://www.rockwellautomation.com/...ves/standalone-control/2198-kinetix-5100.html
Thank you for your assistance,
Tim</p>

            <p>It would be beneficial to reach out to your local distributor for potential opportunities to obtain advanced servo drives and motors. Connecting with them could lead to sponsorship for hardware upgrades, benefiting both parties. Additionally, community colleges often have access to ready-made lab guides that can enhance your laboratory experience. Have you considered exploring these possibilities?</p>

            <p>In experimenting with the Kinetix 5100 and the KNC standalone software, tim_callinan and his students are seeking to connect digital I/O to the 5100. While assuming a SCSI-2 cable 50 pin connector was the correct choice, they encountered compatibility issues. Instead of using the suggested breakout board from rockwell, they are in search of a sturdier alternative. Any guidance on the specific connector type would be greatly appreciated, as it is not listed in the product manual. The 2198-TBIO adapter is recommended to facilitate this connection. 
For secure attachment, the adapter screws into the drive itself. Although described as an SCSI adapter in the manuals, the exact fitting connector remains a mystery. More information can be found in the product manual provided by Rockwell Automation.</p>

            <p>Hello Ian, my apologies for the delay in responding. To be honest, some of my students tend to be a bit rough with equipment, so I believe using a breakout board with a cable may be a better solution. I will test this out next semester. In the meantime, I came across a cable and board from Automation Direct that appear to be compatible and functional. If anyone is interested, you can find more information here:
- Breakout board: https://www.automationdirect.com/ad...mmunications_modules_(complete_list)/zl-rtb50
- Cable: https://www.automationdirect.com/ad...nnector_cables_(complete_list)/zl-svc-cbl50-1
Thank you for your input.

            <p>As someone new to servo drives, I am in the process of familiarizing myself with them. Teaching PLCs at a community college, I am eager to incorporate servo basics into the curriculum. Currently, I am encountering issues with the AOIs, specifically the MAH and MAS instructions, on my Kinetix 5100 drive with a small servo. While the MAJ instruction works fine in my program, the MAS instruction fails to stop the servo and displays a "127 - Previous motion has not completed" error. The same error occurs with the MAH instruction, despite no faults being indicated on the drive. My controller is an L82E, the drive is 2198-1004-ERS, and the servo model is TLP-A046. Any advice on resolving this issue would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>As a novice in servo drives, I am eager to expand my knowledge in this area. I am currently instructing PLCs at a community college and am looking to incorporate servo fundamentals into the curriculum. Despite having a Kinetix 5100 drive and a small servo, I am facing challenges with certain AOIs, specifically the MAH and MAS instructions. When I attempt to stop the servo using the MAS instruction, it does not halt and displays a "127 - Previous motion has not completed" error. The same issue arises with the MAH instruction, even though the drive is not faulting. My controller is L82E, drive is 2198-1004-ERS, and servo is a TLP-A046. Does anyone have any suggestions for resolving this issue? You can refer to page 496 of the 2198-UM004D-EN-P manual for general execution guidelines. Additionally, check page 501 for information on the CommandInProgress Sts bit. Ensure that the rung condition for the MAJ command is false when executing the MAS command.</p>

            <p>Vacagreens, a beginner in servo drives, is eager to learn and enhance the curriculum at the community college where they teach PLCs. Despite encountering difficulties with AOIs such as MAH and MAS instructions on a Kinetix 5100 drive, they are determined to troubleshoot the issue. When attempting to stop the servo using the MAS instruction, they receive a "127 - Previous motion has not completed" error. The same error occurs with the MAH instruction. The L82E controller, 2198-1004-ERS drive, and TLP-A046 servo are all in working order. To address the problem, it is crucial to understand that motion commands are edge-triggered and should not be constantly activated in the logic. Utilizing one-shots or the motion commands IP status can help with controlling motion effectively. A simple jog logic can be implemented using XIC, XIO, MAJ, and MAS instructions. For an MAH home instruction, the axis must be stationary and enabled. Any tips or suggestions for overcoming these challenges would be greatly appreciated.</p>
