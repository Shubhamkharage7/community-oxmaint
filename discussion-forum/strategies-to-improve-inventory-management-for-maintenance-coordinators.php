            <p>In order to address your inquiries, it is crucial to have a comprehensive Bills of Materials (BOM) for all equipment, particularly for critical items. Is there a way to streamline the CMMS Infor MP2 process for efficiency? Have spare parts been coded with magnetic labels for easy and quick scanning, similar to a supermarket setup? What is the approximate value of your inventory? Consider implementing an Inventory Value Optimization program with support from top management to ensure full team involvement.

            <p>Are you looking to optimize your Infor MP2 system and offer training to users as needed? A crucial aspect to consider is whether a proper maintenance build-up has been incorporated into Infor MP2, including asset register, BOM, PM, tasklist, KPIs, and more, during the CMMS implementation. Have maintenance KPIs been regularly reported and shared? Inadequate materials management can lead to poor maintenance KPIs, resulting in work orders being delayed due to materials being awaited in user status.</p>

            <p>Hello Nick, it seems like your position involves maintenance planning. In some maintenance organizations, there is a separation between the planning section and the execution team, also known as the maintenance team. Regardless, you can escalate your concerns to your manager to ensure commitments from all parties involved. It may be necessary to create procedures to ensure everyone is aware of the rules. Improving the CMMS system is crucial for faster communication and efficiency. I believe it ultimately comes down to management commitment, so it's important to bring this to the attention of upper management. Best regards.</p>

            <p>Nick, are your storerooms managed by dedicated inventory personnel, or do mechanics have unrestricted access? Allowing mechanics free access could lead to difficulties in inventory control and result in persistent shortages.</p>
