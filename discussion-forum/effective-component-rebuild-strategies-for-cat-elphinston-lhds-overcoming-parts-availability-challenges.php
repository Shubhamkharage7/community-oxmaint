                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am in search of valuable resources and information regarding effective component rebuild strategies for our facilities running similar equipment. Despite implementing different approaches to component rebuilds at each location, we have not witnessed significant availability improvements following major rebuilds based on manufacturer life cycle recommendations. As a result, we have started using oil sampling to gauge when component replacements are needed. However, parts availability has become a major challenge since 2008, with lead times as long as 50 weeks for major items. This issue has prompted us to reconsider our current practices for our CAT/Elphinston LHDs from Australia.</p>

            <p>If you have identical equipment operating at multiple plants and their operating conditions are similar, consider implementing the longest maintenance interval for each type of equipment initially. This approach allows you to make informed decisions based on real-world equipment performance. It would be beneficial to track Failure codes and technician feedback on equipment condition during preventive maintenance (PM) checks. By analyzing the number of consecutive "No problem, acceptable" PMs, typically three, you can determine when it's appropriate to extend the PM cycle.</p>

            <p>If you are considering overhauling the condition of your LHD's, I highly recommend conducting a thorough assessment of the major components. It's important to assess your resources to determine if you will encounter any issues with garage space or available labor. Additionally, ensuring you have an adequate supply of spare parts is crucial. By anticipating which components will be needed and when, you can proactively manage maintenance requirements.

Based on our analysis of various mining equipment, we have found that vendor-recommended lifespans are often conservative. In some cases, the actual lifespan of equipment exceeds what the vendor suggests. This valuable insight is based on data collected from sites where equipment is used until it fails, demonstrating the importance of a comprehensive review of preventive maintenance, life cycle costs, and spare parts management.

If you need assistance with your LHD fleet, our team of PMO consultants with extensive mining experience in the USA is here to help. A comprehensive review typically takes about a week to complete. Feel free to contact me at steve@omcsinternational.com for further discussions. Visit our website at www.reliabilityassurance.com for additional resources and information.</p>

            <p>What is the meaning of LHD? Are rebuild and overhaul synonymous in this context? In my opinion, rebuilding entails fixing something that is already broken, while overhauling typically involves a process that may be prone to human errors, whether due to original equipment manufacturer guidelines or the condition of the equipment.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback. The issue we face with equipment overhauls is significant, especially considering our underground location and logistical challenges. Limited historical data makes it difficult to determine the appropriate life cycle for our major components. While OEM recommendations may be conservative, waiting for signs of degradation poses risks. If we delay maintenance too long, we could lose valuable core credits, impacting costs significantly. I am currently evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches to develop a tailored plan for our unique circumstances. Quantitative analysis is essential for making informed business decisions, although the complexity of the issue means there may not be a definitive solution. Our strategy will prioritize cost reduction and improved availability, recognizing the need to address variables that may not be easily quantifiable.</p>

            <p>Can you elaborate on these points? In essence, if we let a situation prolong, there's a potential of losing almost 50% of the total expenses which are vital core assets. Therefore, it's crucial to assess if these factors are truly benefiting us. By sharing more details on the matter, we can receive feedback from the community.</p>

            <p>I have a good understanding of your current situation and all the previous inquiries still stand. Allow me to suggest exploring a different route for a second opinion. If your insurance covers these trucks for faults and failures, then you may not need to consider the options you are currently exploring. Have you considered seeking out another repair facility yet? With enough research, you may find a company other than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that is eager to earn your business. This could result in a beneficial partnership where they agree to service and set performance goals for your equipment, taking over the responsibility of keeping them operational and saving you from costly OEM overhauls.

When it comes to repairs for beds, the costs may be similar to overhauls when dealing with cracking or fatigue issues. However, final drives, transmissions, and pumps are open for discussion. Staying involved in the maintenance process will be key to your success. For crushers, pulverizers, and conveyor systems that are still under warranty, it is advisable to keep them where they are. Consider the implications of running without these components for two months before making any decisions.</p>
