                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello professionals! Recently moving has made it challenging to reset a PLC if it malfunctions without the need for air travel. I am interested in finding a more cost-effective solution. I have heard that on SLC500s, you can reset minor faults by turning a key in a specific combination from program to run mode. Is there a specific option that needs to be activated in the program for this feature to work, or is it already set as default? Additionally, what is the most effective way to establish a remote connection for fault resets or program updates on machinery equipped with SLC500 5/03 processors? What hardware would be necessary for this setup? Luckily, I have a maintenance technician on-site who can handle physical connections or key toggling as needed. Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>1- To clear a faulted SLC, try slowly cycling the key from program, to remote, to run (and back to remote if needed) in an attempt to resolve any recoverable faults. You can also set a system bit (S:1/8) to automatically reset a recoverable fault upon power cycle. Changes to this bit must be made offline and then downloaded. If the fault persists, it may be unrecoverable. Remember to cycle through all positions twice.2- The 5/03 PLC features two serial ports, requiring one to be bridged to Ethernet for remote connections with a VPN Router. Consider using the Digi One IAP for DF1 to Ethernet gateway or the Stridelinx VPN router from Automation Direct. Upgrading to a 5/05 PLC could eliminate the need for the gateway, but may require modifications to hardware connected to the 5/03's DH485 port.</p>

            <p>OkiePC stated that when the SLC is experiencing a fault, cycling the key to program, then to remote, and then to run can help clear any recoverable faults. You can also set system bit S:1/8 to automatically attempt to reset a recoverable fault upon power cycle. Changes to this bit must be made offline and then downloaded. If the fault persists, it may be unrecoverable.

Additionally, the 5/03 PLC has two serial ports, making a remote connection to it usually require one of them to be bridged to Ethernet with a VPN Router. OkiePC recommended using a Digi One IAP for DF1 to Ethernet gateway and the Stridelinx from Automation Direct as a go-to VPN router. Upgrading to a 5/05 PLC could eliminate the need for a DF1 to Ethernet gateway, but may require replacing or modifying any hardware connected to the 5/03 DH485 port.</p>
