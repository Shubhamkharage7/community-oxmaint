            <p>The level of difficulty in implementing restrictions within a program can vary depending on the task it is intended to regulate. It may either be a straightforward task or a more challenging one. This scenario resembles a typical homework assignment given on the initial day of a programming class, with the possibility of delving into topics such as timers and counters on the following day.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>If this is a school assignment, it's important to put in some effort yourself. Consider outlining the program you want, such as a basic pick & place system. Think about the necessary hardware like pneumatic cylinders and sensors for detecting positions. Consider the required operations like up/down, forward/back, and using a grabber to pick up and drop a part. Another option could be programming traffic lights, which would involve using timers or counters. While you don't need the actual physical hardware for now, having a PLC with sufficient inputs/outputs is crucial for controlling the system. Once you've made these decisions, think about the sequence of operations - what actions are taken and when. Try writing some code and sharing it, so that others can provide guidance. Providing more detailed information will be more helpful than a vague question like "How long is a piece of String."</p>
