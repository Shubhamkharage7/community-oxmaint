                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>In our biomedical research application, we rely on Busch R5-400 vacuum pumps. Initially, our mechanics used Castol Tection 15W-40, a diesel engine oil, in the pumps which proved to be unsuitable due to its high-detergent multi-viscosity properties. Following our recommendation, they switched to the suggested oil, Busch R-590. Despite claims that the oil had turned to sludge in the past, Busch assured us this was not possible. However, upon reverting to Busch R-590, the oil thickened and eventually solidified, leading to pump failure.

Suspecting a reaction between a solvent in the labs and the oil, we transitioned to CPI Engineering CP-9016-100 oil, a hydrotreated parrafin without additives. While initially performing better than the Busch oil, it too is now exhibiting signs of solidification after just 2 months of use. Has anyone encountered this issue before or have insights on which solvent may be causing it? Any recommendations for an alternative oil?

Regular oil analysis has revealed peaks in both the Busch and CPI oils before solidification. These pumps operate continuously for approximately 12 hours daily before being shut down until the following day.

            <p>The Castrol Tection Extra 15W-40 oil is experiencing issues due to its high-detergent multi-viscosity properties. The detergents in the oil are causing clogs in the oil coalescing filters, leading to oil passing through the filters and potentially carrying over lighter base oil fractions. This results in an increase in oil viscosity over time, leading to higher operating temperatures and wear levels. 

To address this issue, considering switching to a non-detergent, single viscosity motor oil may be beneficial. However, it is important to understand the root cause of the solidification of the oil and choose a product specifically formulated for optimal performance in these conditions. 

Analyzing the sludge in the oil is proving to be a complex task as it involves a mixture of various organic compounds that have oxidized or reacted chemically. Switching to a full synthetic oil, such as a polyalphaolefin (PAO), may improve performance by reducing the presence of residual refining byproducts that could be contributing to the solidifying effect. 

Overall, seeking input from others who have experienced similar issues and their solutions, as well as conducting further analysis in the lab, will help in making an informed decision on selecting the right oil for optimal performance. Your thoughts and suggestions are welcome. - Rich Wurzbach Maintenance Reliability Group.</p>

            <p>When using Busch R5-400 vacuum pumps with Busch R-590 oil, it is likely that the manufacturer would recommend their own 15W-40 oil in a Busch container. However, it appears that there is contamination in the circulating oil of the pump. If the vacuum pump is a rotary vane type, it is important to consider the following factors: increase the frequency of oil changes (ideally less than every 2 months), minimize topping up to prevent dirt from entering the system and avoid over-lubrication which can lead to increased heat and quicker oil breakdown. Installing an external oil filtration system may be beneficial for larger quantities. In a recent article, gearbox issues were identified due to ash entering the system, causing oil thickening. It may be necessary to improve the oil cooling system or check for a faulty oil return valve. Considering the oil consumption of the pump as per its operating principle, transitioning to a synthetic oil could be a costly investment.

            <p>While I haven't personally used the R5 models, I have had experience with other Busch products. Upon reviewing the maintenance manual, I was surprised to find that the oil in these machines needs to be changed every 1000 hours, which is quite frequent for a running machine. In comparison to my other machines running at 3600 rpm, this stands out as an outlier. Following Steven's advice, I opted to install an external lubrication system with a filter and cooler after facing repeated seal and bearing issues. This has not only increased reliability but also allows me to conduct oil sampling, level checks, and changes online. Some considerations to keep in mind are the operating temperature (R-590 being high temp >100C) and the potential impact on oil separation. I have encountered issues with the 5-gallon pails that Busch delivers oil in, as they can easily introduce water or other contaminants. If in doubt, it's best to order new oil. Additionally, for a Welch vacuum pump used in a glove box, I found it necessary to add a chemical filter (ACID NEUTRALIZATION TRAP) to prevent the catalyst from reacting with the oil. It's possible that the lab solvents could also be affecting the oil quality. I have attached the viscosity curve for Busch oil for comparison with other oils.</p>

            <p>Dear Steven and Bayway,

Thank you for sharing valuable information about the rotary vane pump and its 14-quart oil capacity. High temperatures pose a challenge, especially with the pump running continuously during the day shift and remaining idle overnight. To address this issue, we are exploring the possibility of implementing a logic system to alternate between the four pumps in the skid. This will help in reducing vacuum levels in the tank, allowing the pumps to cool off and facilitate the flow of oil back to the lower chamber.

We are currently conducting tests on new oil containers to check for contaminants, following your recommendation. While integrating a separate drop-out container or external filter may not be feasible due to safety concerns, we are looking into ways to minimize oil carryover and reduce the need for frequent top-offs. Utilizing synthetic oil may offer a solution to extend maintenance intervals in case of missed or delayed oil changes.

It is worth noting that similar Busch vacuum pumps in other parts of the facility do not encounter the same issues, possibly due to differences in operating patterns. Cycling the pumps is essential to prevent heat buildup and oil carryover in the discharge.

Thank you for your insights and suggestions.

Kind regards,
Rich Wurzbach</p>

            <p>Converting 14 quarts to about 13 liters in metric units can be surprising if you are used to imperial measurements. When I was developing my maintenance strategy, I discovered that the manual recommended changing the oil every 1000 hours of operation, which equates to approximately 41 days of continuous use. To err on the side of caution, I decided to stick to a monthly interval for oil changes. It's important to note that this particular equipment does not just contain the oil - it actually "consumes" some of it through gas flow, making it crucial to prevent any obstructions in the oil return lines or valves to avoid loss of lubricant. Neglecting regular oil changes could lead to wear, tear, overheating, thickening, clogging, oxidation, and other potential issues in accordance with Murphey's Law.</p>

            <p>Hi there, Steven. I agree that oil consumption is prevalent, but with the proper setup of the pump, installation of coalescing filters, and use of the correct oil, most of it can be recovered. Busch claims an impressive 99.5% retention rate. However, continuous operation of the pumps can lead to increased carryover, as there is no downtime for the oil to drain back through the drain hole from the upper to the lower reservoir. The design of both the drain hole and the supply tube to the pump inlet should facilitate oil return to the lower chamber, but any loss in vacuum efficiency can hinder this process. Additionally, detergent oil can cause clogging in the coalescing filters. The main issue here seems to be the higher temperatures from continuous operation and the presence of solvents that can deteriorate the oil, leading to quicker failure. I was surprised to see how rapidly new oil solidifies in these pumps. Interestingly, the same oil in the same pumps in different buildings lasts significantly longer without solidifying. These pumps typically cycle and have a chance to cool between runs, possibly being exposed to different solvents from various labs. Have you encountered solidified oil when opening up these pumps? (Check out the attached image of a dissected spin-on filter). Rich Wurzbach MRG</p>

            <p>Quote: The consistency of oil in pumps across various buildings lasting 4-6 months without solidifying raises questions about the process, upstream components of the pump, product quality, and operational conditions of the vessel. Are there missing trays or liquid carry-over issues? Have there been any recent modifications? When did the issues begin?

            <p>Have you considered the benefits of using synthetic oils? Traditional motor oils can contain up to 30% additives, leading to the formation of sludge. In contrast, synthetic oils offer improved performance in high temperatures with a minimal additive package. Have you consulted with a lubrication engineer at your oil supplier regarding this?</p>

            <p>Alex, we have considered using synthetic oil, but have decided not to go with it initially due to the frequent oil changes required because of contamination from solvents in the vacuum stream, as well as the added cost of these frequent changes. However, if we can't find another solution, we may need to reconsider using synthetic oil. While motor oil is not ideal due to its additive volume, it has not solidified like severely hydroprocessed oils, which is why mechanics are suggesting a return to motor oils. I may have to allow the use of motor oil, but I will insist on straight 30wt non-detergent oil and closely monitor it with oil analysis. My influence is limited in this matter, but I will do my best to ensure the proper oil is used. Rich Wurzbach.</p>
