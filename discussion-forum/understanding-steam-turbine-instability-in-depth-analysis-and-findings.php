            <p>Sub-synchronous vibration occurs at 65% of operating speed, becoming more prominent at loads exceeding 90%. Irregular behavior is observed at lower loads and intensifies at higher loads, causing the 364 MW turbo-generator to trip (at levels exceeding 175 micro m pp). Measurements taken from both bearings of the HIP rotor reveal that the IP side (BRG 2) experiences the most significant vibrations. Orbits exhibit erratic patterns and the keyphasor mark is unstable, with forward orbit precession. The steam pressure remains constant at 171 bar.</p>

            <p>It appears that the Turbine at Vibramac is possibly facing flow-induced rotor instability, leading to sub-synchronous vibrations and potential stalling that could result in a trip. It might be beneficial to compare the turbine's operation to its performance curve for further insight. Best of luck with resolving this issue. - Rajan Muthukrishnan</p>

            <p>Greetings, Vibrmac! Based on your description, it is possible that your turbine is experiencing rotor instability. Various factors, such as labyrinth seals, aerodynamic effects, fixed geometry bearings, and internal friction at shrink fits, can generate destabilizing forces within the turbine. If you are facing rotor instability issues with your steam turbine, you may find the following references helpful: 
 
1. "Unstable Oscillations of Turbine Rotors due to Steam Leakage in the Clearances of the Sealing Glands and the Buckets" by H. Thomas (1958). Published in the Bull de L'AIM, volume 71, pages 1039-1063. 
 
2. "Turbine Rotor Vibrations Excited by Steam Forces (Steam Whirl)" by E. Pollman and H. Termuehlen (1975). ASME Paper 75-WA/Pwr-11. 
 
3. "Application of Recent Rotor Dynamics Developments to Mechanical Drive Steam Turbines" by W. J. Caruso, B. E. Gans, and W. G. Catlow (1982). Presented in the Proceedings of the Eleventh Turbomachinery Symposium at Texas A&M University, pages 1-18. 
 
To analyze stability, Alford's equation (as per API) is commonly used to estimate the destabilizing effects of labyrinth seals and turbine blades. While this equation provides a decent estimate, more advanced analyses of labyrinth seals can offer a more precise quantification. The original paper by J. S. Alford, titled "Protecting Turbomachinery From Self-Excited Rotor Whirl" (1965), published in the ASME Journal of Engineering for Power, volume 87, number 4, pages 333-344, can be referenced for further study. 
 
If your machine is new or has recently been modified, please let me know if you require assistance in diagnosing or resolving any issues. Feel free to reach out to me for support. Best regards, Hunter www.BRGmachinery.com</p>
