            <p>Hello Kim, I am delighted to join the conversation about defect elimination. I appreciate you initiating it. What is the main topic of discussion? (By the way, it took a while to get the ball rolling on this topic!) In regards to your previous message... Wishing you and everyone else on this list a Merry Christmas.</p>

            <p>Daryl, Topical theme? Hmmm...Josh originally brought up the topic. I believe it was sparked by Winston's discussions on defect elimination related to the DuPont methodology that inspired The Manufacturing Game(TM) development. Personally, I am more inclined to delve into this type of defect elimination rather than delving into a Six Sigma debate at this moment. If we wish to explore defect elimination through Six Sigma, we should consider starting a new thread. My focus lies on cultivating a culture that no longer tolerates or creates workarounds for the minor annoyances that collectively result in significant time, money, and resource wastage annually. It is crucial for individuals within the organization to identify the root cause and find ways to eradicate it. Does this sound like a good topic for discussion? Kim PS: Or were you referring to a Tropical Theme... in which case, I may need to update my wardrobe as I am far from retirement age. (Do all soon-to-retire gentlemen wear tropical shirts to work, or is it just a trend at my workplace?)</p>

            <p>What is defect elimination and how does it differ from zero-defect and zero-breakdown approaches? Addressing defects is essential in Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) to enhance Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Quality professionals often discuss minimizing non-conformance costs, while ISO9000 sets a goal of zero non-compliance. What is the most effective methodology or system for reaching this objective?</p>

            <p>Hey Kim, I've gone through nearly all of the articles in the link. This defect elimination process reminds me of something I've encountered in the past, but I didn't fully grasp it at the time as it was part of a quality program for all employees, as outlined by P Crosby. He emphasizes 5 quality principles and utilizes a Process model worksheet to assess inputs and outputs.</p>
