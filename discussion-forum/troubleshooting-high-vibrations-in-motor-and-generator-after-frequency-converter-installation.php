Subject: FREQUENCY CONVERTER BALANCING ISSUE

Greetings, 

I would like to seek your input on a recent case involving a Frequency Converter. After the Motor & Generator underwent overhauling and the equipment was installed, high vibrations were observed during trial runs. Following the identification of Motor bearing issues, the Motor underwent bearing replacement and dynamic balancing. Subsequent shaft alignment was conducted post-Motor repairs, resulting in decreased vibrations on the Motor side while vibrations on the Generator side remained unchanged.

Despite attempts to reduce vibrations through balancing, the Generator N.D.E Vertical Vibration actually increased from 3.6 mm/sec to 6.9 mm/sec (1x increased from 2.6 mm/sec to 5.5 mm/sec). Further balancing efforts, including the addition of 90 grams on the Cooling Fan, resulted in increased vibration levels. Finally, with the addition of 190 grams, the Generator N.D.E Vibration reduced from 5.07 mm/sec to 3.1 mm/sec (1x reduced from 3.3 mm/sec to 0.5 mm/sec).

To address this issue, we are considering checking the Anti Vibration Mounts and await further guidance.

Hello all,

I would like to share a case for discussion regarding a Frequency Converter. After undergoing Motor and Generator overhauls, vibrations were detected during trial runs. While the Motor side vibrations decreased after addressing bearing issues and dynamic balancing, the Generator side vibrations remained the same. Despite efforts to reduce vibrations through balancing, the Generator N.D.E Vertical Vibration actually increased. The addition of balancing weight on the Cooling Fan did not yield the desired results. We are currently investigating Anti Vibration Mounts for a solution.

            <p>Hello everyone, have you inspected the tension of the generator cables? It's possible that they are exerting pressure on the generator, which could be impacting the effectiveness of the N.D.E. Anti Vibration Mount. If the mounting is not working as intended, it may result in increased vibration levels on the generator side.

If you are experiencing balancing issues with your frequency converter equipment, it's important to address them promptly. In a recent case involving motor and generator overhauling, vibrations were observed during trial runs. While motor repairs helped reduce vibrations on the motor side, vibration levels remained high on the generator side.

Attempts to balance the equipment led to an increase in N.D.E Vertical Vibration, highlighting a potential issue with the anti-vibration mounts. It is recommended to thoroughly check the mounts for any potential issues that may be contributing to the vibration problem. Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hello Kishore,

The presence of antivibration mounts beneath a fabricated frame can lead to a soft foot issue. I recommend conducting vertical measurements on all motor feet, the driven unit, and the antivibration feet on the frame. If there is excessive vibration at any of these points, try slightly loosening that particular foot to see if the vibration diminishes. A change in vibration levels could indicate a soft foot problem, causing twisting of the motor frame and potentially affecting the bearings, leading to vibration issues.

Greetings Members,

I seek your insights on a recent case involving a frequency converter. Following the overhaul of the motor and generator, the frequency converter exhibited high vibration during trial runs. After identifying and addressing a motor bearing issue, which included bearing replacement and dynamic balancing, shaft alignment was performed. Although vibration decreased on the motor side, it remained high on the generator side.

Attempts to reduce vibration through balancing resulted in an increase in vertical vibration on the generator's non-drive end, while adding weight to the cooling fan. Despite efforts to balance by adding weight, vibration levels continued to rise. However, there was a reduction in vibration on the generator's non-drive end.

We recommend inspecting the anti-vibration mounts and eagerly await their response.

            <p>Hello Gary Latham, I have conducted vertical vibration tests on all anti-vibration mounts. I observed a significant vibration of 6mm/sec on the AV mounts on the Generator N.D.E side. 

In response to your query about frequency converter balancing issues, having anti-vibration mounts under a fabricated frame can lead to soft foot problems. I recommend taking vertical readings on all motor feet, the driven unit, and the anti-vibration feet on the frame. If there is excessive vibration at any of these points, slightly loosening that foot may reduce the vibration. If this adjustment affects the vibration levels, it could indicate a soft foot problem causing twisting in the motor frame, which can lead to bearing damage and vibration.

Hello Members, I seek your input on a frequency converter balancing problem. After overhauling the Motor & Generator and installing the frequency converter, high vibrations were detected during trial runs. Despite changing the motor bearings, dynamic balancing, and realigning the shaft, the vibration on the Generator N.D.E side remained constant while the Motor side decreased. Attempts to reduce vibrations through balancing led to an increase in vertical vibrations on the Generator N.D.E side. We added balancing weight to the cooling fan, but vibrations persisted. We recommend inspecting the anti-vibration mounts and await feedback on this matter.

            <p>Hello Kishore, there may be a potential issue with rotating looseness (1X with harmonics) in combination with underlying base issues. Have the motor and both units undergone overhaul? Please confirm the phase difference between NDE Horizontal-Vertical and on the Base and foundation. Additionally, high-frequency peaks may be detected on the spectrum, so check for bearing fault frequency as well.

Subject: FREQUENCY CONVERTER BALANCING PROBLEM

Greetings to All Members,

I would like to request your input on the following scenario:

Equipment: Frequency Converter
After motor and generator overhauls, this equipment was installed on-site and exhibited high vibration during trial runs. A motor bearing issue was identified, leading to the motor being sent for bearing replacement and dynamic balancing. Despite realigning the shaft post-motor repairs, vibrations decreased at the motor side but remained the same on the generator side. Attempts to address this with balancing resulted in an increase in the Generator N.D.E Vertical Vibration from 3.6 mm/sec to 6.9 mm/sec (1x rose from 2.6 mm/sec to 5.5 mm/sec). We added balancing weight of 90 grams on the cooling fan. However, vibrations increased with additional weight (190 grams). The Generator N.D.E Vibration decreased from 5.07 mm/sec to 3.1 mm/sec (1x reduced from 3.3 mm/sec to 0.5 mm/sec). We recommend inspecting the anti-vibration mounts and await their response.

            <p>Hello Kishore, it is quite common for even experienced individuals to mix up directions while moving weights. If you noticed an increase in vibration after moving the weight, have you verified the direction in which the weight was moved? It's important to double-check this to ensure everything is in the correct position. If you need any assistance, feel free to reach out. Thank you! - Andy Mellor

            <p>When conducting testing, it is crucial to provide detailed information about the nameplate, load, voltage, current, and other electrical data related to the frequency converter. Vibration testing can be challenging, especially with larger frequency converters like the one in question. I am particularly interested in the addition of a fan at the far end of the system and the output frequencies of the converter. Electrical signatures in vibration often exhibit 2X line frequency patterns, such as 7200 (assuming 60Hz) for the motor (1800 RPM) and other values at the frequency converter. Various electrical conditions within the frequency converter can lead to complications. Components like the shaft between machines and potential eccentricity issues can also impact vibration, both mechanically and electrically. It is essential to consider factors such as mechanical balance, harmonics of running speed, and rotor or eccentricity-related problems in the system. Detecting such issues may require a higher fmax. For further insights and discussions on this topic, feel free to share your input. Thank you. - Dr. Howard W Penrose, CMRP, President of MotorDoc LLC in Lombard, IL.</p>

            <p>Hello Kishore, you mentioned that there is vertical vibration on the non-drive end (NDE) of the motor base. It is common for units installed on vibration pads to experience issues due to the deformability of the structure. The vibration may be caused by a coupling problem pivoting through the drive end (DE) of the motor and shaking the NDE, possibly due to a dry coupling. Many engineers overlook the fact that supporting a base on pads can lead to vibration since the base is not solid and may be warped. To prevent vibration, it is best to install equipment on a firm, properly machined base set in place on epoxy grout for a solid bond with the floor. Additionally, check the equipment's feet for trueness before installation to prevent softfoot issues. This type of installation can significantly reduce vibration in the surrounding areas. Thanks for your attention to this matter.

Hello Howard,

Could you provide the nameplate information and details related to the load, voltage, current, and other electrical data during your testing? Balancing frequency converters, especially of this size, can be quite challenging. I am particularly intrigued by the addition of a fan at the far end of the system and the output frequencies in the converter. Electrical signatures in vibration often reveal 2X line frequency, which could be a concern in this scenario. There are various electrical conditions and mechanical factors, such as shaft eccentricity, that can contribute to vibration issues. It is crucial to address these factors to determine the root cause of the problem accurately. Keep me updated on your findings.

Subject: Troubleshooting Frequency Converter Balancing Issues

Dear Members,

I seek your input on a recent case involving a frequency converter. This equipment was installed post-maintenance on the motor and generator, but during trial runs, it exhibited high vibration. Subsequent inspection revealed motor bearing issues, leading to bearing replacement and dynamic balancing. Although motor repairs addressed vibration on that end, the generator side still shows high vibration levels. Despite attempts to balance the generator, vibrations increased on the N.D.E vertical side. Further adjustments with additional weights did not yield the desired outcome. On the positive side, vibrations decreased on the N.D.E side after adding balancing weight to the cooling fan. We recommend inspecting anti-vibration mounts while awaiting a response.

Thank you for your insights.

            <p>I am closely following the ongoing discussion and I believe that the issue at hand may be related to a mechanical problem. Here are some key questions that I would like to address: 

1. Are there specific data from the initial installation that can be referenced?
2. What level of vibrations are acceptable from the operator's perspective?
3. Are there drawings available that depict the original state of the equipment?
4. Were the ball bearings replaced during the repair with the same bearing clearance specifications (e.g., suffix C0-C5)?
5. Are there quality assurance documents that detail the repair and reassembly process?
6. Was proper care taken to prevent any dirt from entering the equipment?
7. Has the gap dimension at the flange connection been monitored?
8. Has the correct coupling been installed, or has it been partially or entirely replaced?
9. How was the alignment procedure carried out - using a straight edge or a measuring system?
10. Have the bolted connections been tightened to the correct torque, and were the appropriate bolts used in terms of material?
11. Have any vibration dampers been altered, or are they not suitable for the equipment?

I also agree with the previous speaker’s observation that the torsional stiffness of the frame seems insufficient. Additionally, it might be beneficial to reconsider the placement of the cooling fan to ensure that air cooling originates from an external source rather than the room environment.

            <p>Conduct a vertical surveillance of your equipment to address issues at the vertical joint, as indicated by your data (refer to Howard's comments). For example, the equipment may only exhibit a small stability area. Best of luck with resolving this issue.

Subject: FREQUENCY CONVERTER BALANCING PROBLEM

Greetings to All Members,

I would like to request your input on the following scenario:
Equipment: Frequency Converter
This equipment was installed after Motor & Generator overhauls and experienced high vibration during trial runs. Upon inspection, a problem with the Motor bearings was identified, leading to the Motor being sent for bearing replacement and dynamic balancing. Despite realigning the shaft after Motor repairs, the vibration on the Motor side decreased while the Generator side remained the same.

Attempts to reduce vibrations through balancing resulted in an increase in Generator N.D.E Vertical Vibration from 3.6 mm/sec to 6.9 mm/sec (1x increased from 2.6 mm/sec to 5.5 mm/sec). A balancing weight of 90 grams was added to the Cooling Fan. However, vibrations continued to increase with additional weight (190 grams) added.

Meanwhile, the Generator N.D.E Vertical Vibration decreased from 5.07 mm/sec to 3.1 mm/sec (1x reduced from 3.3 mm/sec to 0.5 mm/sec). We have suggested checking the Anti Vibration Mounts and are awaiting a response.

            <p>Greetings to all! Currently, the generator rotor has been sent for dynamic balancing by the customer. I will provide updates on the results post repairs and installation. Your input on the following issue is appreciated: Following motor and generator overhauling, a frequency converter exhibited high vibrations during trial runs. After addressing motor bearing issues and conducting dynamic balancing, vibrations decreased on the motor side but remained unchanged on the generator side. Despite attempts to reduce vibrations through balancing, the generator's N.D.E vertical vibration increased. Additional weight was added to the cooling fan, resulting in a decrease in N.D.E vibration. It is recommended to inspect the anti-vibration mounts for further improvements. Stay tuned for updates on this situation.</p>
