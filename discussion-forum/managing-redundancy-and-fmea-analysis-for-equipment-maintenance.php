                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Currently, I am in the process of setting up maintenance plans to prevent possible equipment failures, following the RCM methodology. I utilize a FMEA matrix to assess the potential consequences of failures and based on these findings, I establish maintenance protocols. However, the challenge arises in our facility due to the presence of redundant equipment, as shutting down operations is not an option. In cases where a redundant pump experiences a failure, there is no loss in production, leading to the suggestion of no preventive maintenance based on FMEA analysis. Despite this, the reliability of operations decreases as there is no backup system in place. How can redundancy be effectively managed in conjunction with FMEA analysis? I am seeking insights from individuals experienced in implementing RCM strategies for redundant equipment. - Erik</p>

            <p>Implementing Predictive Maintenance (PdM) strategies can have a direct impact on your bottom line by avoiding catastrophic failures and identifying underlying faults to increase Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). This results in minimized maintenance expenses while maximizing equipment reliability. It is crucial to integrate PdM technologies into your facility for improved cost-effectiveness. For example, investing in monitoring equipment such as motor ($4,000), pump ($6,000), and coupling ($500) can significantly reduce potential downtime and maintenance costs.

By adopting a proactive approach, a timely rebuild based on common sense reasoning can prevent major failures. In some cases, a simple bearing replacement can avoid a complete breakdown. Regular tracking and analysis of equipment performance, such as monthly or quarterly monitoring of individual bearings, can ensure cost-effective maintenance practices. Utilizing advanced techniques like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Time Waveform Analysis (TWF) can provide valuable insights while also considering the overall equipment health.

It is important to balance the cost of analysis with the value of the equipment being monitored. Spending $3,000 on diagnostics for a $1,000 motor may not be justifiable. Prioritizing maintenance tasks based on criticality and potential cost savings can result in optimized maintenance practices and increased operational efficiency.</p>

            <p>In the scenario where a backup pump malfunctions, resulting in no loss of production, the recommendation from Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is to skip preventive maintenance. This decision is based on the understanding that the redundant pump does not require regular maintenance. Therefore, the logic behind FMEA is to suggest preventive maintenance for the primary pump only, as it serves a critical function, while no maintenance is needed for the redundant pump since it can easily take over in case of failure. Essentially, both pumps are redundant to each other, allowing for efficient maintenance practices.</p>

            <p>Hi Erik, When dealing with redundancy, the analysis of hidden failures becomes crucial. If there is a single level of redundancy, you can determine the risk level using a straightforward formula. The attached document provides the formula and an illustrative example. It's important to note that Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is only a constant in the case of random failures. The formula specifically addresses unexpected failures - those that occur without warning or prediction. By calculating a failure finding interval based on these factors, you can align the frequency of failure testing with the acceptable risk levels. However, the considerations don't stop there. There are several other options to explore:

- Implement predictive and preventive maintenance strategies for pumps to reduce the likelihood of unexpected failures.
- Introduce additional redundancy measures for pumps, valves, and other critical components.
- Ensure hidden failures are made visible by designing fail-safe circuits.
- Consider running the standby equipment at all times to make failures immediately apparent (though this could be costly).

These are just a few suggestions, and there may be other approaches to consider. I hope this information is useful to you. If you encounter any issues with the attached document, please contact me at steve@omcsinternational.com.</p>

            <p>When it comes to managing risk effectively in dealing with redundancy and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), there are key factors to consider: consequences and probability. While FMEA evaluates consequences, it is also important to assess the probability of failures. In cases where redundancy is in place, such as with duty/standby operations, taking a proactive approach is crucial. 

For the duty equipment, immediate consequences may not be dire, allowing for a run-to-failure strategy. However, timely attention to the failed item is essential to prevent further risks. If repair times are lengthy, there is a risk of the standby item also failing, leading to decreased reliability. To mitigate this risk, reducing repair times and implementing minimal maintenance practices can be effective strategies. 

On the other hand, the standby item poses its own challenges, including hidden failures like fail-to-start. By incorporating regular testing and loading of the standby item, these risks can be minimized effectively. In conclusion, by balancing proactive maintenance strategies and risk assessment, organizations can enhance the reliability of their operations.</p>

            <p>In the event outlined in the Failure Finding Task report, it is important to illustrate how the malfunction linked to pump B becomes apparent. When pump B is in operation and unexpectedly ceases to function, pump C seamlessly takes over without any operational disruptions. This could potentially lead to the operator overlooking the failure of pump B due to the seamless automatic transition between the two pumps.</p>

            <p>In a real-life situation, a battery charging room employs two redundant exhaust fans to eliminate explosive fumes. While one fan runs constantly, the other is intended to activate in case the primary pump malfunctions. These belt-driven exhaust fans are positioned in the ceiling, with no scheduled maintenance due to redundancy. During a routine inspection, I noticed a noisy belt and requested further investigation. The mechanic discovered that the standby fan belt was deteriorating, while the duty exhaust fan belt had already failed. This incident highlights the concept of a "hidden failure" in the event of a duty fan belt malfunction.</p>

            <p>quote: The lack of preventive maintenance in this situation is concerning due to the redundancy. It appears that the fans are left running constantly without any oversight. Opening the door to a room filled with gas could potentially be dangerous as it may allow oxygen to enter or release harmful substances. This oversight could have serious consequences, and I find it to be more reckless than redundant.</p>

            <p>When it comes to the run-to-failure approach in equipment maintenance, it's important to note that it doesn't mean neglecting regular checks until something catastrophic happens. Preventive maintenance, such as oiling and cleaning, should still be performed periodically. This strategy involves keeping minimal parts and consumables in stock and inspecting the equipment every few months to ensure it's still operational. This proactive approach allows for timely repairs or replacements in case of a breakdown. While run-to-failure may work for certain components like wiper blades, it's not advisable for critical parts like brakes or the engine of a car. In many places, there is a legal requirement for annual vehicle inspections conducted by authorized entities.</p>

            <p>In the event that the B pump stops while in operation, is there a visible indication for the operator to determine if it is running? Time is not a factor when determining if a failure is apparent. If the operator can determine whether a failure has occurred at any point after the event, then it is considered an evident failure. Hidden failures, on the other hand, cannot be detected by the operator's senses or instruments without a subsequent event triggering a reveal, such as placing a demand on a pressure relief valve or gas detector.</p>

            <p>According to Rod, the exhaust fans in the ceiling are belt driven, posing potential hazards such as loose belts catching fire. While there is no preventive maintenance due to redundancy, it is essential to consider the safety implications. Belts typically become slack over time and require periodic tightening. The decision to forgo preventive maintenance may seem unusual, especially in light of safety concerns. Redundancy can streamline maintenance efforts, but it is crucial to reassess the decision if safety implications are at stake, particularly in explosive environments where belt drives may not be the most suitable solution.</p>

            <p>Vee, after considering your perspective, I appreciate the fact that adding another element introduces another potential point of failure to address. Ultimately, the key factors to consider are: which configuration is superior in terms of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and ease of maintenance planning? One option includes equipment A, redundant equipment B, and an alarm system to alert when A fails and B takes over; while the other option only includes equipment A and redundant equipment B without an alarm system. Is it justified to add an extra component to the system for early detection of equipment A failure? And does adding an alarm system ultimately decrease the overall reliability of the system?</p>

            <p>Darth once said, "Is early detection of equipment failures enough reason to add another component to the system? Will adding more alarms decrease overall reliability?" These are important questions, and the answer is actually NO. Before we consider adding new equipment, let's explore other options. 

1. A toothed belt drive is more reliable than a V belt drive as it prevents slipping and potential fires. It also reduces bearing loads. 
2. Performing a belt tension check as part of a preventive maintenance routine can help identify potential safety hazards. Additionally, greasing bearings, cleaning motor cooling fins, tightening foundation bolts, and inspecting the area can help determine when belts need replacement. These are cost-effective measures with potentially high benefits (such as avoiding fires).

My concern lies with offshore subsea installations, where equipment is often neglected under the assumption that if it's out of sight, it's out of mind. This mindset can be dangerous, whether it's neglecting exhaust fans on ceilings or pipelines in water-filled trenches. Each new alarm added to the system requires a failure-finding process in the CMMS and has the potential to generate false alarms. Operators may become complacent if they rely too heavily on alarms.

In situations where there are numerous false alarms, it is crucial to focus on basic maintenance tasks before jumping to complex solutions. Following the logic of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), alarms should only be added once all other options have been exhausted. I am not against alarms; however, they should be implemented thoughtfully as each solution could create new issues.</p>

            <p>Hey Darth, I want to emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in this situation. In Rod's scenario, it's difficult to determine if both fans are working properly. There are no clear indications, such as an ammeter or alarm light, for the operator to know the status of Fan A, Fan B, or both. This is different from easily accessible equipment like pumps. In Rod's case, any malfunction remains hidden until the fumes themselves reveal the issue. It's vital to not overlook the potential secondary effects of failures, especially when safety is at stake, despite the belief that a backup system will automatically take over. For instance, a fan belt failure may not disrupt production immediately if the backup kicks in, but it could lead to a fire risk if the V-belt slips unnoticed. This safety hazard is unacceptable. Furthermore, if we can't determine which fan is operational or if any fan is running at all, there's a risk of explosive vapor accumulation. Therefore, installing indicator lights is a cost-effective and practical solution to track fan operations, but it's not foolproof. Regular maintenance, like tightening V-belts, is still necessary to prevent potential accidents. These concerns wouldn't exist if the fans were only handling non-explosive mixtures. I hope this clarifies the distinction for you.</p>

            <p>Implementing redundant systems is essential for effective preventive and predictive maintenance. Neglecting equipment until it fails is negligent. Redundant systems eliminate excuses for not properly maintaining operating equipment. By utilizing these redundancies, significant resources can be saved quickly. Non-life safety systems should require manual recovery from failures to avoid potential dangers. It is imperative to promptly address all failures and take necessary actions for recovery and repair.</p>

            <p>Steve makes a valid point about the importance of focusing on critical equipment in plant design. It's common to see plants with excessive redundancy and bypasses that actually hinder performance. In one plant, despite all the additional features, it couldn't operate at more than 80% of its capacity because no equipment was considered critical. This approach led to a lack of accountability and measurement of key metrics. However, after implementing changes to hold people accountable and track losses, the plant's performance improved significantly. This highlights the importance of avoiding over-engineering and focusing on essential equipment in plant design. The Japanese success in manufacturing can also be attributed to their lean manufacturing principles, such as eliminating waste and adopting a just-in-time approach. This strategy helped identify and address issues without relying on buffer stocks. Ultimately, a shift in mindset towards prioritizing critical equipment and efficiency is crucial for driving success in plant operations.</p>

            <p>Cases of over instrumentation have been reported in our facility, specifically with our kiln that operates within a specified temperature range. We utilize eight temperature probes that provide data to the control center regarding the kiln temperature. These probes are calibrated to 0.1% accuracy every three months. Interestingly, the operator manually checks the product at the outfeed conveyor to determine its moisture level. If the product is too dry, the operator decreases the kiln temperature, and if it is too wet, the temperature is increased. The parameters for the infeed are not fixed, leading to variability in the process. Despite this, the operator does not prioritize the kiln temperature accuracy within 5%, even though the probes are calibrated to a much higher precision.

            <p>I came across a fascinating article by "Vee" that suggests staggering duty-standby equipment in a 7-weeks on and 1-week off schedule can lead to significant improvements. By implementing this strategy, there could be a notable increase of 10-12% in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and a corresponding decrease in maintenance costs. Many redundant systems in industrial plants usually allocate time evenly between duty and standby. However, after reading the article, I am inclined to agree with "Vee" that this unconventional approach may offer valuable benefits.</p>

            <p>Hello! I came across an intriguing article by "Vee" discussing the benefits of staggering duty-standby equipment cycles. By alternating between 7 weeks and 1 week of operation, it could potentially increase Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) by 10-12% and reduce maintenance costs. 

I recommend implementing a strict duty-standby schedule whenever possible, such as 8 weeks on and 1 day off. The specific interval can vary depending on factors like the failure rate of standby equipment and system availability requirements. In cases where a pure duty-standby setup is challenging, consider uneven operation like 7 weeks on and 1 week off.

By adjusting the operating schedule, the number of starts can be reduced significantly. This can lead to a 50% decrease in seal failure rates, particularly in industries like oil and gas where seal failures contribute to a significant portion of pump failures. According to OREDA data, seal failures make up about 22% of pump failures in the industry.

By reducing the number of starts, it is possible to see a decrease in overall pump failure rates. In theory, pump failure rates could drop from 100% to around 89% with a properly implemented duty-standby regime. This theory has shown promising results in practice as well.</p>

            <p>When incorporating the FMEA approach and RCM philosophy, it is essential to ensure that the analysis does not compromise the reliability of operations. Despite the plant having ample redundancy, the requirement for continuous operation signifies the importance of prioritizing reliability efforts. Leveraging the FMEA process to generate proactive maintenance tasks for equipment is crucial for enhancing reliability. It is imperative to implement predictive maintenance techniques extensively and deeply. Conducting RCM analyses can reveal redundancies and identify potential weak points in reliability, especially for operations that are critical. Balancing wear across equipment families is vital, as is avoiding a run-to-failure approach. Improving reliability at the component level through thorough FMEAs and actionable tasks strengthens overall plant reliability. Consider reducing preventive maintenance frequency after implementing vibration, thermography, and ultrasonics maintenance programs. Best of luck in your efforts.</p>
