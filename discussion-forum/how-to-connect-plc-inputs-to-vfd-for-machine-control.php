                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>I am currently testing the use of a PLC LOGO for controlling some pre-existing controls within a machine. Programmable outputs on my Drive are being utilized to trigger the contacts on the logo, including functions like zero speed, active alarm, and drive ready. Although I have limited experience with PLC programming, I have successfully created a program that works well in simulation. However, I am encountering an issue where the PLC is not recognizing inputs from the 24V outputs of the drive when actually in use. How can I establish a connection to receive inputs from an external source like the output from the drive? It seems that the circuits may need to be connected in some way for proper functionality.</p>
