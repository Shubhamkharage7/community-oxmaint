                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I wanted to share a scanned copy of Resnikoff's "Mathematical Aspects of Reliability-centered Maintenance" after using it for several years. I highly recommend that everyone take the time to read or at least skim through this document. It is a truly significant piece in our field of management and has the potential to shift perspectives on certain issues, or at the very least, provoke thought.

The blurb in the book states: "The main purpose of this appendix is to provide a mathematical description of the Reliability-Centered Maintenance Program developed by United Air Lines. While a mathematical approach may not simplify the implementation of this program, it highlights the universality of its fundamental principles and encourages their application to intricate systems beyond commercial air fleet maintenance operations."

I hope that this document proves valuable to everyone on this platform. It is intended for open distribution, as stated on one of the initial pages, so there should be no issues with sharing it here. For many of us, this could be the final piece of information needed on RCM. Resnikoff, Nowlan, and Heap's work, along with MSG-3, serve as excellent foundational documents. You can access the documents mentioned in this post by visiting the link provided: Foundation Documents of Reliability.</p>
