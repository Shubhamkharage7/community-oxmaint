                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I am in the process of creating training materials focused on maximizing Preventive Maintenance effectiveness in various industries. I am looking to gather insights from you regarding the common problems faced during Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities. I have outlined some key issues based on my knowledge and feedback received thus far. Here are the top concerns identified through a survey conducted on May 26, 2008:

1) PM Checklists Syndrome - where PM checklists and tasks continue to expand (2 votes)
2) Infant Mortality Failures - situations where issues arise post PM replacement or overhaul (1 vote)
3) Replacement of functioning parts to align with PM specifications and processes
4) Random Failures - unanticipated breakdowns included in PM checklists (1 vote)
5) Aging workforce approaching retirement
6) Inadequate training on maintenance processes (3 votes)
7) Operational dependence on reactive maintenance despite established PM programs (3 votes)
8) Frequent plant reorganizations leading to new systems under new management
9) Poor or insufficient documentation for PM procedures (2 votes)
10) PM waivers - Operations bypassing PM for production requirements (1 vote)

Please select the top 3 issues that stand out to you (e.g., 1, 2, and 4). As we gather more insights, we can collectively develop recommendations for these identified challenges. Your participation and input are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your involvement. Warm regards,</p>

            <p>Greetings to everyone!
Drawing from my past experience in the manufacturing industry, a common issue encountered during preventive maintenance (PM) is as follows: 1) the phenomenon of an ever-expanding PM checklists and activities; 2) Infant Mortality Failures, referring to problems emerging post-PM replacement and overhaul; and 3) PM being waived by operations to meet production demands. 
With warm regards,</p>

            <p>Dear all, I encourage others to join in and participate in this survey. So far, I have shared it with a few of my contacts and here are the initial results. Despite our different geographical locations, we may be facing similar issues. Updates will be posted in the main thread. Please note: I apologize for any oversights in this survey. If you wish to participate without disclosing your industry, please email me at rollyangeles@rsareliability.com. Your response will be kept confidential, with only the votes being shared without any names or industries attached. Thank you for your participation. Warm regards, Rolly Angeles.</p>

            <p>Dear Josh and All,

Thank you, Josh, for your suggestion, but I believe it would be more beneficial for me to conduct this survey manually. Currently, I have received responses from 10 individuals, and it is intriguing to see that the number continues to increase steadily. I have decided to set a deadline for the survey, which will be on June 2, 2008. The results will be shared on this forum by June 3 or 4, 2008. 

In order to maintain confidentiality, only the total number of participants and the survey results will be disclosed. The identities of the participants and their respective industries will be kept private. Recognizing the significance of this survey, I urge everyone to participate. If you would like to take part, please send an email to rollyangeles@rsareliability.com. 

I am confident that the insights gathered from this survey will be valuable to all of us in the realm of reliability. Your involvement is greatly appreciated. 

Warm Regards,</p>

            <p>Dear Dabbler, I want to express my gratitude for your generous contribution. At the time of writing this, a total of 13 individuals have participated in our survey - 12 have submitted their responses via email, and one through this forum (you). While the results are still preliminary, the top challenges in Project Management based on the survey responses are as follows: 1) Persistent reactivity and excessive corrective maintenance despite a well-established PM Program (8 votes) 2) The phenomenon of PM Checklists Syndrome - a growing list of PM checklists and activities (7 votes) 3) Instances of Infant Mortality Failures - issues emerging post PM replacement and overhaul (7 votes) 4) A lack of training in maintenance functions (7 votes) Warm Regards,</p>
