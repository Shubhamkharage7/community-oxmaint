            <p>Hello Howard, I hope you don't mind the delay in responding to your previous message. Lately, I've noticed a shift in the world of corporate giants - they are no longer as aggressive as they once were. This trend can be seen in the increasing alignment between financial and physical asset management, which is gaining momentum. Take a look at Macquarie Banks for example, they have made strategic acquisitions in sectors such as water, airports, highways, and gas distribution networks, focusing on maximizing the economic potential of these assets rather than simply cutting costs. This approach, aimed at increasing productivity and capital allocation, is evident in many recent takeover deals. Companies like RIO TINTO, now a potential target for acquisition, are likely to prioritize output optimization over cost reduction. This balanced approach is exemplified by initiatives like PAS 55, PPP, and PFI contracts in Europe, as well as the surge in private equity activity. These developments underscore the growing importance of asset management in today's corporate landscape, signaling a departure from the era of excessive cost-cutting. These observations are based on my recent experiences in the industry.</p>

            <p>Word on the street is that Daryl is spot on about these equity firms aiming to maximize their ROI. And boy, would I love to get a piece of the action on the $36 billion sell-off that Daimler is planning! - Terry O</p>
