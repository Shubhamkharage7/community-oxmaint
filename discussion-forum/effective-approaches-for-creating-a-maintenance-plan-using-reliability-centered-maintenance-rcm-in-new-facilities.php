            <p>Eugine, I wanted to discuss the importance of reviewing maintenance policies for assets in order to determine the best approach. Some assets will have vendor-recommended maintenance policies that need to be assessed, while others may not have any policy in place. It's important to prioritize which assets should undergo a thorough review and which may not require as much attention. Additionally, some assets may benefit from a Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) review, while others may be better suited for Preventive Maintenance (PM) Optimization. Regards, Steve.</p>

            <p>Ahmed, mastering the Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) process is key to simplifying maintenance procedures. Start by identifying the main functions of your assets and then break down the components that support each function. It's essential to develop a maintenance strategy (conducting RCM analysis) early on to allow room for input on necessary design changes. Our team conducts multiple RCM analyses annually for clients, resulting in benefits such as faster startup and accreditation processes, as well as minimized post-installation redesign efforts. Steve recommends utilizing the Project Management Office (PMO) for managing less critical assets effectively. Reach out to Doug Plucknette for further insights.</p>

            <p>Hello Doug, I hope you're still enjoying your RCM Blitz Coffee cups - they work just as well Down Under! I want to clarify that I never said RCM should replace PMO on critical assets, despite the implications made. We have successfully utilized PMO on various assets, including Major Hazardous facilities, for over a decade. Some forms of PMO can achieve the same maintenance program as SAE Standard RCM in significantly less time, making them both viable options. The decision between PMO and RCM is typically based on the asset's history and familiarity in a particular environment. If the asset has a well-established maintenance program and known failure characteristics, PMO may be preferred. However, if the equipment is new or innovative, RCM may be the better choice. Looking forward to reconnecting at IMC later this year. And don't worry about promoting your coffee cups - I may need even more this time around. Cheers, Steve.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I appreciate your comments. I began this discussion after completing a project for a local oil company involving their new facilities. While the company specified the methodology and interface for analysis, the actual study and analysis procedures were our responsibility. The main goal of the project was to create a maintenance strategy incorporating all components of the new facility - static and rotating equipment, piping, electrical, instrumentation, and civil work. We relied on a combination of vendor recommendations and our own on-site and intercompany experience since there was no existing history to guide us. One challenge we encountered was task redundancy; certain vendor recommendations were needed for warranty purposes but could have been replaced by machine condition-based activities. I welcome any thoughts and feedback you may have.</p>

            <p>Hello Ahmed, the process of rationalization and review you have implemented falls under the umbrella of "PM Optimization (PMO)." At OMCS, we specialize in this type of process. One issue we encountered was task redundancy, where some vendor recommendations for warranty purposes were deemed non-essential intrusive activities that could be replaced by machine condition-based activities. Our extensive analysis of vendor recommendations has shown a wide range in quality, with some being highly inefficient. 

Let me share a case study with you to illustrate the importance of thorough maintenance reviews. We worked with a company that purchased equipment worth over $100 million and faced downtime costs of $30,000 per hour. Before commissioning, we conducted a review of maintenance requirements proposed by vendors and assessed the asset's inherent reliability. 

During the analysis, we found that the recommended maintenance program would consume 4% of total time, exceeding the 96% availability agreement between the supplier and purchaser. By identifying and proposing modifications, we were able to reduce PM downtime to just over 1%, resulting in potential annual savings of nearly $8 million. 

The collaboration between vendor and operator led to a fully agreed maintenance program, addressing hidden failures and improving operator training. It also highlighted the need for ongoing review and documentation to prevent future overservicing and ensure continuous improvement. 

If you need assistance with maintaining and updating your analysis, we offer a software package for PM optimization. Additionally, consider reviewing what the vendor may have missed to achieve a comprehensive maintenance program similar to full RCM standards. Share any results you've achieved, such as the percentage of tasks deleted or extended. 

Great work on this topic, Ahmed. Feel free to reach out for further information. Regards, Steve Turner</p>

            <p>We typically exceed the recommended OEM PM frequency by doubling it, even during shutdowns, after thoughtful deliberation. Have you had success with the effectiveness of PMs suggested by industry codes and standards? For instance, NFPA mandates a monthly inspection of portable fire extinguishers - do you adhere to this requirement diligently? Share your experiences!</p>

            <p>According to Josh, it is common practice to double the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) preventive maintenance (PM) frequency, taking into account any shutdown periods. However, it is important to carefully assess the situation. While it may be recommended to overhaul equipment at set intervals, such as every two years, examining the specific failure modes addressed by an overhaul can often reveal that condition-based maintenance is sufficient and more cost-effective.

By transitioning to a condition-based maintenance approach, some companies have successfully extended the lifespan of their equipment without the need for costly overhauls every two years. Josh cites an example where four identical machines have been running smoothly for six years without any issues, resulting in savings of $300,000 in overhaul costs annually. This shift in maintenance strategy highlights the potential benefits of considering alternative approaches beyond routine overhauls.</p>

            <p>Thank you, Steve, for your feedback. In our situation, the vendor was more focused on maximizing profits from service work rather than making necessary changes in their recommendations. On the other hand, the customer decided to wait until the warranty period expired before making any changes. The vendor overlooked crucial aspects of the vibration monitoring system, instead suggesting frequent replacements of process detection probes and transmitters every six months, rather than conducting inspections and calibrations. This was just one of many issues. They scheduled intrusive maintenance semi-annually and annually, with annual overhauls in the second year costing nearly 55% of the initial asset acquisition cost. A suggestion was made to reassess the maintenance strategy every two years, with the first review scheduled just after the warranty period ends. While the customer was not interested in documenting the percentage change in the program, implementing our recommendations could potentially save them approximately 600K-800K USD annually per system (there are 2 systems on site) currently spent on unnecessary maintenance. Additionally, they could avoid losing around 6-6.5M USD in production downtime.</p>
