            <p>Hello Oli, I wanted to let you know that all membership approvals are up to date. Typically, memberships are approved within a few hours or at most one day. However, please keep in mind that managing memberships is more of a passion project rather than a business venture for me. Last week was a bit slow due to my presence at a US Air Force base where access to Wi-Fi was limited. Upon my return to Florida, everything is back on track. We are currently in the process of planning a community upgrade and migrating to a new server. We are optimistic that this transition will be smooth and without any delays. Stay tuned for more updates. Wish us luck!</p>

            <p>Hello there, the situation is similar here, despite it being a power plant nestled within bedrock. It seems that working with the Navy can sometimes be simpler, but that's just how it goes here. Moving things around is always an exciting task, so please make sure to back up the current version. I'll test it out to ensure it works for my friend. Best of luck, enjoy yourself, and stay safe. Do you have a set date for when this will take place? Quick update: my friend has yet to receive the confirmation email, so he has reached out to the support team. Another update: it has been reported that everything is now up and running, so there is one more person who can share their experience. - Olov</p>

            <p>Thank you Oli for your message. Here are some updates: 1) Our backup process is currently in progress. 2) We are aiming to complete the move within the next 30 days. 3) It seems there was an issue with my email as I just received a new set of member approval requests this morning and have already approved them. 4) Just a heads up: Approximately 25% of membership requests we receive are from "back linkers" looking to spam our discussions with links to their websites for SEO purposes, such as Coach bag discounts. This is why we carefully screen applicants to maintain the cleanliness of our boards. Please pass on our apologies for any delays to your friend.</p>
