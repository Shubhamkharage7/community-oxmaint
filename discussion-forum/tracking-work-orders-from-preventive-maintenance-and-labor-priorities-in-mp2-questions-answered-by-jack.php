                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Is there a method to monitor work orders that stem from preventive maintenance activities? For example, if a faulty bearing is identified during a routine lubrication and inspection round, and a subsequent work order is generated to address the issue, is there a way to keep track of this process? Additionally, I have recently updated the task and labor durations for our tasks. I have noticed that in the "details" tab, the labor code displays priorities for various labor types, which seem to be incrementing numerically per task. Some priorities have exceeded 100. Can you please explain the significance of this feature and how it impacts the tasks? Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Jack.</p>

            <p>Hey Jack, I'm not sure how we can connect the two work orders. Typically, we are focused on tracking the number of preventative maintenance (PM) work orders that lead to corrective work orders (CW). Our aim is to minimize the occurrence of these types of tickets. Our PM work orders are classified as "PM" while any work orders resulting from a PM are labeled as "CWPM". You can easily access all CWPM tickets in the system by equipment number or by customizing your search through the equipment reports menu. By sorting the history by equipment number, you will be able to view all related tickets.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the input, Jim. We are currently working on a similar approach. It is unfortunate that we are unable to connect them together.</p>

            <p>To enhance organization and efficiency, consider appending a suffix to the Work Order Number when creating subsequent work orders. For example, if PM work order 01234 generates a corrective work order, utilize 01234C as the new work order number. This method ensures that related work orders are grouped together when sorted by work order number.

            <p>Donal, I really like the concept you've brought up. Currently, we already have a filter for the equipment number in our work order history, but I can definitely see the benefits of implementing this new system. It might be a good idea to assign work orders with a numbering system that includes the equipment number, work order number, and a suffix. The conversation is quite engaging over here, Jim.</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,

I suggest avoiding duplicating data in the work order by ensuring the correct equipment is assigned. Many times, an incorrect equipment number is mistakenly used for a repair due to a confusing equipment numbering system, making it hard to track work order history. To improve visibility of the equipment number, consider modifying the layout of the work order. You can refer to this sample for guidance: http://www.flemingtechnical.com/documents/modified_mp2_work_order_(long_form).pdf

            <p>I utilize a specific type of Maintenance work order system known as R-RPM, which involves repairs initiated by a preventive maintenance task. The task from the preventive maintenance where the issue was identified is linked to the new work order, along with the sublocation of the equipment. I have the ability to track work orders not by number, but by task number, and can also filter by equipment. Every repair conducted on our equipment is accompanied by a task. As we undertake new jobs, our system generates a list of necessary parts and tools. The maintenance technician performing the work adds notes to the task, which is then recorded in MP2 as a repair for the specific sublocation of the equipment. This comprehensive process allows us to develop a streamlined repair method with associated parts for future use. Each repair task is assigned a unique code for reference.</p>

            <p>Hello Jack, we have provided training to our production team members in various areas to submit work order requests for modifications, breakdowns, and repairs that require approval. These requests do not include repairs stemming from preventative maintenance activities. If a troubleshooter deems a repair can be postponed without causing immediate downtime, it is forwarded to me and my planner for further evaluation and scheduling. Our maintenance staff understands the importance of documenting all activities with a work order. This practice has become ingrained in our operations over the past year and a half. I am currently incorporating strategies from Doc Palmers maintenance planning guide to maximize uptime and reduce our backlog.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1.  Is there a way to monitor work orders resulting from preventive maintenance activities in MP2?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: Yes, you can track work orders that originate from preventive maintenance activities in MP2. For instance, if a problem like a faulty bearing is identified during routine maintenance, a work order can be generated to address the issue, and you can monitor this process within the system.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2.  What is the significance of labor code priorities exceeding 100 in MP2's "details" tab?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> Answer: The incrementing numerical priorities for labor types in the "details" tab of MP2 indicate the importance or urgency of specific labor tasks. When priorities exceed 100, it typically signifies a higher priority level. Understanding this feature helps in managing labor tasks effectively and ensuring critical tasks are addressed promptly.</p>
