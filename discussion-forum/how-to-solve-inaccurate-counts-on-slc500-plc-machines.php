                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Greetings to all! At my company, we utilize SLC500-based PLC machines to manufacture parts. Each time a part is produced, a counter increments and stores the count as an Integer. This allows us to view the count on the HMI and transmit it to Ignition Gateway for monitoring. The counts are consistently accurate to the actual production output.

However, there is an issue with another tracking product we use. Instead of simply reading the Integer (the same one displayed on the HMI and Ignition), this product detects changes in the Integer and counts them. This unconventional method sometimes results in inaccurate counts, with occasional instances of unusually high numbers like 65537, 2592, or 2675, disrupting the tally.

Despite my efforts to suggest reading the number directly instead of performing their own counting, the other team remains steadfast in their approach. I believe the issue lies on their end, but convincing them has proven challenging. Any insights on why these irregularities may be occurring from the PLC perspective? Your input is greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>What is the speed at which the integer updates in the PLC, and what is the polling frequency for the ignition system or other methods used to retrieve data? Additionally, does the counter reset or roll over, and how is this accounted for in the system?</p>

            <p>Hello robertmee, thank you for responding. The number updates approximately every 1.3 seconds (due to a press with a maximum speed of 45 spm). We monitor when the number decreases below its starting point. While I am unsure of their polling frequency, it appears to be capturing the data accurately. The team can only see the number, not the actual counter. At the start of each shift, the counter is reset to zero, which also resets the number. They have timestamps for the counts they receive, which do not coincide with the reset times. The counter has a maximum limit of 32767, but we are nowhere near that, usually reaching a maximum of 10000 in a shift, which is rare. I have attached a screenshot for reference â€“ it should display all 1s. They have confirmed they are referencing N7:3, so I am unsure about the reference to c:c016.</p>

            <p>With a value of 65537, the opposing party is utilizing 32-bit integers in their computations, whereas the PLC is working with 16-bit integers. The PLC is transferring the counter's .ACC value to N7:3. Is it possible that the other party's OPC is accessing both N7:3 and N7:4? If this is the case, does your team ever input data into N7:4?</p>

            <p>The number 65537 exceeds the limit of a 16-bit number, with an unsigned int maxing out at 65535. This means that the maximum value for a signed integer, like the counter, is 32767. It appears that the system is actually retrieving 32 bits, specifically from N7:3 and possibly N7:4. Occasionally, both the first bit of N7:3 and N7:4 are high when data is retrieved. It is advisable to check if your program is interacting with N7:4 as well. Look into this issue promptly to ensure smooth operation.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, thank you for your responses. I am puzzled as to why they are seeing the N7:4, as it does not seem to be the issue. I do not believe that would explain the values in the 2000 range; it could be related to the 63000 one instead. I have implemented a B bit that pulses for the same duration as the counter would count up, in an attempt to troubleshoot the issue. Unfortunately, we are still unsure of the root cause. I am utilizing the Ignition Gateway for tracking and counting parts, as well as maintaining a history for reference purposes, such as analyzing trends in pump pressure and temperature within the plant. Additionally, we utilize it to manage a database of badge numbers that have access permission to specific HMI pages. Any updates to this database are automatically synchronized with the PLC, streamlining the process of access control management across multiple machines. Another team within our organization is utilizing Hydra for inventory tracking, cost evaluations, and other related tasks.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, I just wanted to provide a final update on this issue. After a call with them, I clarified the length they were seeking based on feedback received here. It turns out they were actually looking for a longer length, specifically related to N7:4 HMI screen calls. By toggling a few settings, we were able to address the issue causing their numbers to fluctuate. Instead of simply reading the number I provided, they were subtracting it from the previous number and adding it to their new total for some reason. After making a change on their end to only look for a word instead of a long length, the fluctuations ceased. Thank you for your patience, as this has been a persistent issue for quite some time.</p>
