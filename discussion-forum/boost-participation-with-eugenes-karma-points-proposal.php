                    <p>Hello Eugene, I wanted to remind you about the proposal you made regarding karma points on the maintenance forums. Your deadline is quickly approaching.

            <p>In summary, my proposal is to launch a "Quality Contributor of the Year" contest where forum members can nominate and vote for the best contributors to the boards over the past year. The contest will consist of two rounds: 

1. Members can nominate authors of posts from March 2006 to February 2007, providing reasons for their nominations. 
2. In March 2007, Terry and his team will select the top 10 (or 5) candidates for a final vote. Members will have the opportunity to vote for the winner from this list in a Poll post. Each member can only vote once. The voting period will end on April 02, 2007, with the winner announced on April 03, 2007.

If you're interested, we can adjust the dates to allow more time for nominations. Suggestions include considering posts from April 2006 to March 2007, accepting nominations until April 15, 2007, and announcing the winners by April 30, 2007.

Additionally, I propose that members can also nominate a group of contributors. For example, if MemberA posts a question and Members B, C, D, E, and F provide answers, but B and D stand out with exceptional ideas or solutions, any member can nominate them for recognition. It would be helpful to include a link to the thread for reference when making a nomination. Let's celebrate and acknowledge the valuable contributions of our forum members!</p>

Instead of singling out just six individuals (or teams) each year for prestigious awards like the Nobel Prize in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Economics, Literature, or Peace, why not celebrate all quality contributions without the need for awards such as the Nobel, Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, OTI, and others.</p>

            <p>On eng-tips, users have the option to award a star to posts they find particularly helpful by simply clicking on the little purple star button. The star appears on the post, indicating that it has received recognition, although the identity of the voter remains anonymous. Posts that receive numerous stars are typically deemed valuable by a wide range of users. Each user's profile displays the number of posts they have made in each forum, the number of stars they have received, and the number of stars they have given to others. While this feature has its advantages and disadvantages, maintenanceforums.com offers a similar feature where users can rate entire threads with stars, with a maximum rating of 5. Is it possible for one user to max out the rating by awarding 5 stars?</p>

            <p>Hello Eugene and Electepete, I propose that instead of voting on the top 10 or best posts, we leave the decision to a panel of board members. Based on the lack of participation from many forum members, I believe this approach will yield more meaningful results. Let's have you, Terrence, and a selected group establish the criteria for judging the posts. Best regards, Rolly Angeles - Educator.</p>

            <p>Rolly, I completely agree with you. I had a few nominations in mind, but I was waiting to receive feedback from Terry and the others before finalizing them. As you can see in the initial discussion, Josh was the one who originally proposed the idea of a Quality Contributor of the Year. I expanded on Josh's idea and suggested a way to implement it, recommending that Terry kick off the thread to give it a more formal appearance. When it comes to board composition, I believe it should be left for Terry and his team to decide.</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone! Making judgements based on a single criterion can be challenging. It's best to evaluate using a combination of criteria. These may include awards for the most viewed posts, the most replies to a post, special recognition for active forum members with over 1000 posts, top threads or posts from 2006-2007, accolades for the top 5 Quality Contributors, and recognition for the most controversial post. Terry will provide certificates and hats to be sent to the recipients. This initiative aims to encourage more contributions. I suggest moving the awards ceremony to December 2007 for better preparation. Winners who are unable to attend can submit photos holding their certificates and hats with a brief message. Once the rules are finalized, Terry's team will make an official announcement on the forum or via email. Your thoughts? Best regards, Rolly Angeles, Educator.</p>
