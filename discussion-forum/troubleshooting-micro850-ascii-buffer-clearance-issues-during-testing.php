                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Developing a tester with a Micro850 in Connected Components Workbench involves scanning a barcode during each test cycle to determine the tests to run. To check the barcode buffer's content, an ACB block is utilized to count the characters and verify if it meets the required test length. The ARD block reads the buffer's content and passes this information to the program to identify the necessary tests. In case of incorrect barcode length, an ACL block clears the buffer to prepare for the next cycle.

While my approach aligns with standard procedures, I encountered issues with buffer clearance when the barcode length is incorrect. The buffer clears effectively with a zero or correct length for the ARD, but fails to clear with an incorrect length until the PLC is power cycled. A simplified testing setup focuses on counting, reading, and clearing the buffer.

During testing, toggling the ScanBarcode bit is done manually, with the correct barcode length set at 36 characters. Challenges arise when the barcode length exceeds 82, causing the ARD block to malfunction and preventing the ACL block from clearing the buffer. Seeking assistance to better understand block functionality, as existing documentation is limited.</p>

            <p>I am not familiar with these instructions, but it seems like there may be a timing issue. According to the help documentation, the Q bit is updated asynchronously from the program scan. The BufferCounted in Rung 2 is only true for one scan, which means that CounterReset will also only be true for one scan (in the same scan as BufferCounted). If ACB_1.Q has not become true yet due to an error, you may not be able to reset the block until Q is true. To ensure that the ACB_1 block is ready before considering it to have been counted, you could try removing the BufferCounted coil from Rung 2 and creating a separate rung with XIC(ACB_1.Q) OTE(BufferCounted). This will help in ensuring that the block is ready before proceeding further.</p>

            <p>PLC programming revolves around the concept of time and the scan cycle acts as the system's clock. As @Incandenza pointed out, the buffered serial communications operate independently of the scan cycle, emphasizing the significance of when bits change state over how they change state. Effectively managing this process is a complex task. It is worth noting that the ACB instruction is activated by a rising edge, making the -|P|- edge-detection instruction on its feed rung potentially unnecessary. In conclusion, understanding and efficiently handling these aspects in PLC programming is crucial.</p>

            <p>Upon closer examination, it became apparent that the ACB and ABL instructions in the PLC programming software serve the same purposes, taking the same inputs and producing the same outputs. This unusual similarity could be attributed to a common trend seen in the development of automation software, where an initial version may have been flawed and replaced with a revised version bearing a slight variation in name. In some cases, the original faulty instruction may have been retained to avoid disrupting existing code implementations or because it still functioned in specific scenarios. This observation calls to mind similar situations encountered with Micro800 PID instructions, suggesting a familiar pattern in software evolution.</p>

            <p>After successfully resolving the issue on my own, I made minor adjustments to rungs 5 and 6. I noticed a peculiar behavior with the ACB and ARD blocks - despite being designed to output for only one scan, the Q bits remained high and activated output coils on the rung. By incorporating a normally closed contact to block the output when the count is incorrect, I can better manage the clear bit. It seems likely that @drbitboy's assessment of these blocks being faulty is accurate, as my extensive testing has consistently shown issues. While I am curious to explore other suggestions mentioned in this thread in the future, for now, I am content to leave the code as is to avoid any potential disruption, given that it is currently functioning correctly.</p>

            <p>It's possible that the program is not functioning as expected, as PLCs only follow commands without regard for desired outcomes. The screenshots provided illustrate a program repeatedly calling ACB and displaying a count of 0 due to lack of input. The behavior of the output bit, ACB_1.Q, is noteworthy: the first image shows alternating values during scan cycles, while the second image demonstrates a persistent value despite trigger changes. Manually adjusting the count results in immediate reset to zero, indicating continued operation despite signal changes. The chan.Cancel setting can reset the state, but only upon the next ACB IN rung transition.</p>

            <p>In the realm of practical philosophy, I would like to gently challenge the title of this forum thread posted by OP: "Micro ASCII Buffer Not Operating Properly." It is rare for a programmable logic controller (PLC) to not operate correctly; most of the time, the issue lies in the instructions not performing as outlined in the documentation, especially in lower-quality software like CCW. However, these instructions generally function as intended once implemented, even if the documentation is inaccurate. A more suitable title for this thread could be: "I need assistance understanding the operations of Micro850/CCW serial port ASCII instructions," addressing the core problem that needs resolution.

Although it may appear to be a minor philosophical point, I can attest from my extensive experience that assuming the computer is executing instructions precisely as commanded is a more efficient approach to solving programming challenges. Wasting time on complaints about functionality not aligning with expectations is counterproductive. Personally, I often create small test programs, like the ACB instruction test mentioned earlier, to analyze behavior patterns. Despite my critique of the title, I commend OP for crafting a concise test case to showcase the peculiar behavior, indicating a focus on the right aspects, even if not reflected in the thread title.

It is important to note that the definition of "properly" is subjective, and debating whether the computer should perform a certain task is more of a philosophical discussion rather than a practical one. Over my decades-long career, I encountered a bug in a Fortran compiler only once, despite mistakenly attributing bugs to the compiler numerous times before that.</p>

            <p>japes393 expressed gratitude to @drbitboy for conducting testing, which greatly aids in comprehending the functionality of these blocks. How do you operate the "EN/ENO" sections, @PLCs_are_fun? I once had a concept to implement something similar but couldn't quite figure it out. When utilizing EN/ENO, "IN" transforms into a VarInput for the function block. I categorized bits to the left of ASCII instructions as tertiary and passed them to the function block instances. Upon reviewing my code revisions, I eventually abandoned that approach and manually enforced the instructions without utilizing EN/ENO. It seems like you also succeeded in making it work. I have included my somewhat crude solution for reference. It's worth noting, @drbitboy, that while it may be a semantic debate, it seems justifiable to argue that these instructions function "improperly." One should not reasonably expect a false rung followed by an instruction to activate output coils due to the Q bit being set - even within CCW, as other instructions do not exhibit this behavior.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>In the world of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), there is a common misconception that a false rung followed by an instruction will always energize output coils when the Q bit is set. However, it is important to understand that this expectation may not always hold true. While many instructions do follow this pattern, others do not. It is crucial to recognize that ladder logic in a digital PLC operates differently from the current flow in physically connected relays. For example, edge-triggered instructions may have their .Q value set to 1 several scan cycles after the input rung returns to FALSE. This discrepancy is evident in instructions like TOF. It is essential to always be mindful that every instruction within a PLC system performs some action, whether it involves replicating the input rung's state or something more complex. Failing to acknowledge this reality can lead to false assumptions that hinder our ability to diagnose and fully comprehend the workings of the PLC. Stay informed and attentive to ensure a thorough understanding of PLC functionality.</p>

            <p>drbitboy explained that PLC programming revolves around timing, where the scan cycle acts as the clock. I concur with @Incandenza that in this process, particularly in buffered serial communications, operates independently of the scan cycle. The timing of when bits change state is more significant than the actual change itself; effectively managing this is a challenging task. Additionally, the ACB instruction is activated by a rising edge, making the -|P|- edge-detection instruction on its feed rung potentially unnecessary. For further reference, please refer to the attachments 66088 and 66089. On a related note, could you guide me to the location of the "bit" signaling that the data in the input buffer is ready for reading? Your assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>

However, there is additional processing involved to determine whether the buffer length is suitable, as indicated by BufferCountOK and BufferCountNOTOK. This is my first time working with comparison instructions for String variables on this type of processors. I am encountering a situation where two variables that should have the same value do not. Where should I begin troubleshooting this error? The "Item_number" variable is obtained from a barcode reader, while the "Item_test" variable is retrieved from a String array. Any advice on this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>It is unclear what information you are seeking as the image does not show the value of ITEMS[3] or indicate the presence of leading or trailing spaces, making it difficult to determine the lengths of the strings. If the item_number is from a barcode scan and ITEMS[3] is the expected value, several possibilities should be considered: the entry in ITEMS[3] may have been input incorrectly due to typographical errors, leading/trailing spaces, transposed characters, or missing characters, which can be verified by checking the value in ITEMS[3]; the string scanned from the barcode device may contain unexpected elements such as leading/trailing spaces, which can be further analyzed using a code-scanner app on a mobile phone; there may be an error in reading the barcode device, which can be compared against the value of ITEMS[3] on the PLC for verification; or the string scanned may simply not match the expected value, though the reason for this discrepancy may be difficult to determine.</p>

            <p>According to drbitboy, the images indicate the presence of the Boolean tag (bit) BufferCounted and alsoACB_1.Q. Additional processing is done to verify the buffer length (BufferCountOK and BufferCountNOTOK). It is important to note that there are two non-visible characters from the barcode reader. Thank you for sharing this information.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. Why is the Micro850 ASCII buffer not clearing properly during testing with incorrect barcode length?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The buffer fails to clear with an incorrect barcode length until the PLC is power cycled, which poses a challenge during testing.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. How are the barcode characters counted and verified in the Connected Components Workbench using a Micro850?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The ACB block is utilized to count the characters in the barcode buffer and verify if it meets the required test length.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What blocks are involved in reading the buffer's content and identifying necessary tests in the testing setup?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The ARD block reads the buffer's content and passes this information to the program to identify the necessary tests.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 4. What action is taken when the barcode length is incorrect in the testing setup?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - An ACL block is used to clear the buffer to prepare for the next cycle when the barcode length is incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 5. What are the challenges faced when the barcode length exceeds 82 characters during testing?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Challenges arise when the barcode length exceeds 82 characters, causing the ARD block to malfunction and preventing the ACL block from clearing the buffer.</p>
