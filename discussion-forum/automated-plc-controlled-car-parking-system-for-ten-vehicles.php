            <p>Leow requested a PLC logic diagram, emphasizing the importance of quality input for quality output in programming. I have created a Chat GeePeeTee prompt for a car parking system automation using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This system is designed to accommodate up to ten cars in the parking lot, with sensors in place on the entrance and exit paths.

To automate the car parking system effectively with a PLC, various components and logical operations are necessary. The essential components include a PLC unit for control, car presence sensors for detection, and a gate motor for opening and closing the gate. Inputs consist of sensors for incoming and outgoing cars, while outputs control the gate motor in both forward and reverse directions.

The PLC logic involves counting parked cars using a counter and controlling the gate based on the number of cars present. When the parking lot is full, the gate closes by activating the Gate_Fwd output for 10 seconds. Conversely, when the car count drops below ten, the gate opens using the Gate_Rev output.

Proper programming in a PLC environment is essential to ensure the system functions correctly. By using the provided Structured Text example program, you can effectively manage the parking system's automation, adjusting as needed based on your PLC's programming language and capabilities. Incorporating sensor debounce and timers for gate motor control will help prevent false detections and ensure smooth operation of the automated car parking system.</p>

            <p>The specification should include provisions for when a car is underneath the gate. For instance, if a car approaches the gate and the sensor detects it, the gate should open if there is space. However, if the car remains under the gate for more than 10 seconds, the gate should remain open until the area is clear for safety reasons. To ensure safe operation, sensors should be installed to cover the gate area adequately, allowing for verification that the area is clear before closing the gate, both for incoming and outgoing traffic.</p>

The reason for this mishap was not placing the parking pass in the window, leading the arm to take payment through an alternative method. This situation is clearly explained in line 15 of the code: IF Ticket = Present, Seating := TRUE; Else Throw_Out_Zeppelin := TRUE; END_IF. Remember to always follow the instructions carefully to avoid any unexpected situations.</p>

<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What happens when the parking lot reaches full capacity?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - When all ten parking spaces are occupied, the system triggers the motor to close the gate in the incoming path for 10 seconds, allowing time for a vehicle to leave and free up a parking space.</p>
