                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello Team,

I am currently employed as a Hardware Design Engineer at Dover Corporation, where we utilize PLC communication as the primary interface for our products. Our PLC module of choice is from Automation Direct. Recently, one of our customers has requested Isolated Inputs and Outputs for our product. To accommodate this request, we are considering adding pre-made isolated modules to the existing PLC DIN rail. Could you please recommend any available Isolated Modules in the market that we can purchase for this purpose? Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>If you are utilizing AD PLCs, consider checking out the following products at Automation Direct: the KPR-SCE-24VACDC-1 electro-mechanical relay and the ZL-RRL16W-24-1 ziplink wiring solution. I have personally used ziplinks and found them to work effectively in my automation projects. Browse these items on the Automation Direct website for reliable and high-quality PLC components.</p>

            <p>As a budding automation expert, have you explored the selection of AD PLC products available at AutomationDirect? I have found great success with their electro-mechanical relays, such as the KPR-SCE-24VACDC-1. Additionally, I have had positive experiences with their ziplinks, like the ZL-RRL16W-24-1 for wiring solutions.



When it comes to PLC brands, I personally prefer Phoenix Contact or Rockwell. As my younger brother used to say, Rockwell may not be the cheapest option, but it certainly delivers quality. In the case of PLCs, investing in a reliable brand like Rockwell may be worth the extra cost.



A helpful tip to keep in mind is to separate the outputs from your PLC by placing relays in one cabinet and inputs in another. This practice ensures that only circuits with zero volts are exposed in the field, maximizing safety and efficiency.</p>
