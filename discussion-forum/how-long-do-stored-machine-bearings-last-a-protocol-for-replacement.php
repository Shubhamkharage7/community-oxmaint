                    <h3>Question:</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Recently, we've been discussing the Motor & Compressors that are stored in our warehouse and put into service when a machine in the plant breaks down. These machines have been sitting in the warehouse for over 5 years, and I suspect that the bearings may not be in good shape (possibly non-spherical balls). As a result, when we start up these machines, they tend to vibrate excessively and sometimes break down within a few days. Therefore, we are looking to establish a protocol for replacing bearings in machines before they are installed in the plant, especially for machines that have been stored fully assembled for a certain number of years. How long do you think we can rely on the bearings in a stored Motor, Compressor, or Pump to be in good condition? In my opinion, for larger machines, I believe no more than 2 years is a safe timeframe. What are your thoughts on this? Thank you!</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Prior to installing a new machine, it is not advisable to replace bearings. With proper maintenance, bearings can have a lifespan of over 5 years. One way to ensure the longevity of bearings while the machine is in storage is to periodically manually rotate it to prevent any potential damage from occurring and to prevent vapor condensation buildup. This simple step can help protect all areas of the bearings and ensure optimal performance when the machine is put into operation.</p>

<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 1. How long do stored machine bearings typically last before needing replacement?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - The lifespan of stored machine bearings can vary depending on factors such as storage conditions, machine size, and type. However, it is generally recommended to replace bearings in machines that have been stored fully assembled for over 2 years to prevent issues like excessive vibration and breakdowns.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 2. What are the signs that stored machine bearings may need replacement?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Signs that stored machine bearings may need replacement include excessive vibration when the machine is started up, irregular noises during operation, and frequent breakdowns shortly after installation. These can indicate that the bearings have deteriorated due to prolonged storage.</p>
</div>
<div class='faq-item bg-light p-4 rounded shadow-sm mb-3'>
<h4 class='text-dark'>FAQ: 3. What is a recommended protocol for replacing bearings in stored machines before installation?</h4>
<p class='text-muted'><strong>Answer:</strong> - Establishing a protocol for replacing bearings in stored machines before installation can help prevent operational issues. It is advisable to inspect the condition of bearings in machines that have been stored for an extended period, such as over 2 years, and proactively replace them to ensure smooth operation and prevent unexpected breakdowns in the plant.</p>
