            <p>OEE, or Overall Equipment Effectiveness, is commonly used for constrained or bottleneck equipment in manufacturing plants. During TPM practices, OEE is measured on pilot machines to identify bottleneck machines in Rank A or the Worst Machine Category. Some plants calculate OEE for all machines to pinpoint process bottlenecks, utilizing software to simplify the process due to its complexity. When calculating OEE for equipment processing multiple products, the units per hour (UPH) of each product must be factored in. In summary, OEE helps identify bottleneck machines, analyze overall plant effectiveness, and factor in UPH for equipment handling multiple products. Additionally, training materials on Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) cover topics such as Planned Maintenance, Autonomous Maintenance, and the correlation between equipment losses and OEE. This comprehensive approach ensures optimal equipment performance and plant efficiency. Best regards, Rolly Angeles, Educator.</p>

            <p>Hello Terry, I see that you have shared this article elsewhere. I would like to provide some feedback on the article titled "Don't be Misled by O.E.E. Measure of Equipment Effectiveness Often Misused." There are some misleading points in the report that I would like to address in a friendly manner to avoid confusion.

To put it simply, imagine a basketball team with more than 8 players, but only 5 players are on the court during the game. Each player contributes differently to the final score, much like the 8 pillars of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM): 

1) Autonomous Maintenance
2) Planned Maintenance
3) Focused Improvement
4) Quality Maintenance
5) Office TPM
6) Environment Health and Safety
7) Training and Education
8) Initial Flow Control Activities

While Planned Maintenance is important, it is the Focused Improvement pillar that has the greatest impact on Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Just like in basketball, each pillar plays a specific role in enhancing OEE.

OEE is not solely a measure of maintenance effectiveness; it is a reflection of equipment performance. Maintenance plays a role in addressing planned maintenance and breakdowns, but other factors such as operations also influence OEE. Total Productive Maintenance takes a holistic approach to eliminate major losses and improve OEE.

Focused Improvement is crucial in enhancing OEE, but all pillars play a part in achieving high equipment effectiveness. Just like in basketball, teamwork from all players is essential for success – in TPM, each pillar works together to enhance Overall Equipment Effectiveness.

Best regards,
Rolly Angeles, Teacher</p>
