            <p>If you're unfamiliar with JD Edwards CMMS, switching to a different CMMS may require migrating your current data like asset registers and work histories, which can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process unless you're willing to risk losing them. A top-notch CMMS should include essential components like data analysis for KPIs, asset registers with bill of materials, task lists, planning and scheduling, work order processing, material masters, inventory management, storeroom management, and contract management.</p>

Currently, we are in the process of replacing JD Edwards maintenance modules with our own, and customers are raving about the improvement.

            <p>Hello Mike, I have extensive experience with JDE as an end user and can provide you with valuable assistance for its implementation. I have successfully implemented the "World" version of the Equipment & Plant Maintenance (E&PM = CMMS) and Job Cost Modules. While these are the older character-based "green screen" versions, I am aware that their newer Enterprise version is more current. According to my research, Oracle is committed to supporting JDE for the next 10 years or so. The JDE World version mainly focuses on financial activities, excelling in managing financial aspects but falling short in the CMMS area. On the other hand, the Enterprise version has received high ratings in Gartner's EAM "Magic Quadrant" analysis for Enterprise Asset Management. If you need help or guidance with JDE, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
