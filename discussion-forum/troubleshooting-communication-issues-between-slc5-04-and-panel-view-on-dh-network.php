            <p>ctrleng14 mentioned a connectivity issue with their SLC 5/04 compressors, which are linked to Panelview and Datahighway via DH+. This has caused a loss in communication with the Hwl Experion SCADA system. The error message on the Panelview indicates a lack of acknowledgment from the SLC at station 2 on the DH+ network. To resolve this issue, it is crucial to troubleshoot and identify the point of failure in the link. It is recommended to check if other devices on the DH+ network are communicating properly and to test by disconnecting devices and adjusting terminating resistors to pinpoint the faulty device or cable. If you are experiencing similar connectivity problems, consider following these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue efficiently.</p>

            <p>Recently encountered a communication loss problem with DH+, which was successfully remedied by re-terminating a single node. The issue was caused by a short circuit, resulting in sudden communication loss despite the network functioning properly. Looking forward to the day when DH+ and DeviceNet technology are no longer in use before my retirement.</p>

            <p>I appreciate everyone for their responses. By "installing" the termination resistor, the problem was successfully resolved. It seems that the EOL resistor may have been accidentally shorted.</p>
