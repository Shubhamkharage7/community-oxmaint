            <p>While you can't delete a shape, you can render it invisible and unresponsive by utilizing a visibility expression, which is likely your desired outcome. This feature allows you to hide the shape while keeping it intact within your design.</p>

            <p>To further elaborate on plvlce's suggestion, in Roblox Studio, you can easily manipulate object visibility by right-clicking on the object, selecting Animation > Visibility, and entering the desired tag in the provided field. This can help you control which objects are displayed in your game based on specific criteria.</p>

            <p>Hello gentlemen, I am looking to utilize an encoder value to demonstrate the movement of objects along a conveyor belt, with a daily quantity of 1000 objects. How can I incorporate this into a visibility expression? Is it necessary to have all 1000 objects displayed at once?</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Although FactoryTalk View may not be the best choice for creating highly realistic animations, there are still ways to achieve it. One such method is using visibility animation, where you can control the visibility of images and shapes based on PLC tag values. While having 1000 objects on a screen is technically feasible, it may result in slow and unappealing performance. Consider exploring Position animation, which allows you to change the X-Y position of objects on the screen.

When working with conveyors, there are more effective ways to provide information to operators, such as displaying device or function statuses, belt or roller speeds, and process updates. By utilizing these features, you can enhance the user experience and optimize operational efficiency.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Apologies for any language limitations in my communication. If you are depicting a production line with boxes moving along, prioritizing information about the boxes may not be necessary. Instead, focusing on animating the movement of the chain is crucial. Using Horizontal Position animation can create the illusion of the chain or belt in motion. Consider placing rectangles accordingly based on your logic, and utilize visibility settings or animation to adjust their presence. Regards.</p>

            <p>In a forum post, sayahan2003 inquired about using encoder values to display moving objects along a chain, with a daily count of 1000 objects. How can this be achieved using visibility expression? Is it necessary to display all 1000 objects on the screen? It is important to consider not overcrowding the screen with unnecessary visuals that do not provide useful information and can slow down responsiveness. Instead, focus on developing a High Performance HMI system to effectively convey relevant data to operators. Explore more on "High Performance HMI" for valuable insights.</p>

        <div class="bg-white p-3 rounded mb-3">
            <p>Robertmee advises against displaying excessive information on the screen, as it can hinder responsiveness and clutter the display. Instead, focus on showing pertinent information about the objects currently in the process. Consider implementing visual indicators for when the conveyor is running and when parts are present. Searching for "High Performance HMI" can provide valuable insights for developing the right kind of information display. Remember, the goal is to provide real-time information, not historical or future data. Save detailed production counts for a separate page.</p>

            <p>As previously mentioned by many, bringing the concept of the Belt or chain to life can be achieved through an animated representation. By incorporating parameters like current or frequency, you can add displays below the motor to showcase these values. Additionally, consider implementing a faceplate for the motor that allows for interactive control. If you require the design file for the strip, please let me know. Thank you.</p>
