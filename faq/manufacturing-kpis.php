            <p class="text-primary">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential metrics in manufacturing that help monitor and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of production processes. Among the numerous KPIs utilized in manufacturing, some of the most critical ones include Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), production yield, downtime, and cycle time. OEE is particularly vital as it measures how effectively a manufacturing operation is utilized, accounting for availability, performance, and quality. Production yield, on the other hand, is a measure of the quality output against the raw material input. Monitoring these KPIs allows manufacturers to identify inefficiencies, maintain high standards, and enhance processes continuously.</p>
            <p class="text-primary">Other important manufacturing KPIs include first pass yield (FPY), which tracks the percentage of products that meet quality standards without requiring rework, and on-time delivery, which measures the efficiency of meeting production schedules. Maintenance-related KPIs, such as mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR), play crucial roles in preventive and predictive maintenance strategies, reducing unexpected downtimes and improving machine reliability. By regularly tracking and analyzing these KPIs, manufacturers can make informed decisions, optimize production, reduce costs, and ultimately boost profitability while ensuring customer satisfaction.</p>
