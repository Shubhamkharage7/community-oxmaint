            <p>
                Measuring hotel performance involves a variety of metrics that provide insights into the operational efficiency and profitability of a hotel. One of the most critical metrics is Occupancy Rate, which is the percentage of available rooms that are occupied within a specific time frame. This metric is essential for understanding the demand for your hotel and making necessary adjustments to pricing and marketing strategies. Another key metric is the Average Daily Rate (ADR), which indicates the average revenue earned per occupied room. When ADR is combined with the Occupancy Rate, it gives the Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). RevPAR is a comprehensive metric that helps in understanding the overall financial performance of the hotel.

                In addition to these primary metrics, it's also important to monitor the Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room (GOPPAR), which provides a broader understanding of the profitability by factoring in the operational costs. Another useful metric is the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), which measures the guests' overall satisfaction with their stay, often obtained through surveys and online reviews. This metric is crucial for maintaining a strong reputation and ensuring repeat business. Lastly, it's important to track the Market Penetration Index (MPI) which compares your occupancy rate with that of your direct competitors. Understanding and analyzing these metrics can significantly aid hotel managers in making informed decisions to enhance both operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.
