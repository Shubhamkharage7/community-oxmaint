    <h1 class="text-primary display-2">What are the different types of manufacturing processes?</h1>

    <p class="text-primary">The manufacturing industry utilizes a range of processes to transform raw materials into final products. These processes can broadly be categorized into three main types: additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing, and formative manufacturing. Additive manufacturing involves building up layers of material to create a product, and it is commonly referred to as 3D printing. This method is ideal for producing complex, customized items and allows for significant design flexibility. Subtractive manufacturing, on the other hand, involves removing material to shape a product. Traditional machining processes such as milling, turning, and drilling fall into this category. This method is precise and is often used for mass production of metal and plastic parts.</p>

    <p>The third type is formative manufacturing, which involves deforming materials using heat, pressure, or both, to achieve the desired shape. Examples include forging, casting, and injection molding. Formative manufacturing is highly efficient for producing large quantities of parts with uniform properties. Each manufacturing process has its own set of advantages, applications, and limitations, making them suitable for different types of projects and industries. Understanding these processes helps businesses choose the most appropriate production method for their needs, leading to more efficient and cost-effective operations.</p>
