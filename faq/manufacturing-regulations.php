            <h1 class="text-primary display-2">What are the latest regulations affecting the manufacturing industry?</h1>
            <p>The manufacturing industry is continuously evolving, and with it, the regulations that govern the sector are also being updated to ensure safety, environmental protection, and fair trade practices. One of the most significant changes is the increased emphasis on environmental regulations. Governments worldwide are now mandating stricter controls on emissions, waste disposal, and the use of hazardous materials. Manufacturers are required to adopt greener technologies and processes to reduce their carbon footprint. Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, legal action, and a tarnished reputation. Moreover, the industry is also seeing the introduction of new standards related to the circular economy, which emphasizes resource efficiency and sustainability.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to environmental regulations, there are also new compliance requirements related to worker safety and product standards. The introduction of the ISO 45001 standard, for example, is pushing manufacturers to adopt more robust occupational health and safety management systems. This standard aims to reduce workplace accidents and illnesses by fostering a culture of health and safety through stringent guidelines and audits. Additionally, regulations such as the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) are critically important for manufacturers, especially those involved in producing electronics and chemicals. Staying updated with these regulations is crucial for operational compliance, market access, and to avoid costly penalties.</p>
