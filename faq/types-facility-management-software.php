    <section>
        <p>Facility management software has evolved significantly to cater to diverse operational needs across various industries. One of the most prominent types is the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), which focuses on the maintenance management of a facility's infrastructure. CMMS software helps in automating maintenance tasks, scheduling preventive maintenance, and managing work orders efficiently. It serves as a go-to for maintenance teams who need to keep track of equipment history, manage inventory, and coordinate asset management activities. This type of software is invaluable to ensuring that assets and equipment function optimally, thereby reducing downtime and improving overall productivity.</p>

        <p>Another important category is the Integrated Workplace Management System (IWMS). The IWMS is designed to be a comprehensive platform that integrates all aspects of facility management, including space management, real estate management, and facility maintenance. It provides a holistic approach to managing the physical workspace, enabling organizations to optimize space utilization, plan for future needs, and reduce operational costs. IWMS often incorporates features from multiple systems, such as Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM), allowing for seamless information flow and better decision-making across departments. By leveraging IWMS software, businesses can streamline their operations and make informed choices that align with their strategic goals.</p>
