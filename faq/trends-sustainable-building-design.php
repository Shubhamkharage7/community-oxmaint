                <p>Sustainable building design and construction have become pivotal in shaping the future of our built environment. One of the emerging trends is the increased use of eco-friendly materials such as reclaimed wood, recycled metals, and low-VOC paints. These materials not only minimize the negative environmental impact but also contribute to healthier indoor air quality. Another important trend is the integration of renewable energy systems. Solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal energy systems are becoming more common, reducing the carbon footprint of buildings and promoting energy independence.</p>
                
                <p>Another significant trend is the adoption of smart building technologies. Automation systems for lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) help optimize energy use and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, water conservation techniques such as rainwater harvesting, greywater recycling, and the use of low-flow fixtures are being implemented to reduce water usage. Green roofs and living walls are also gaining popularity as they not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also provide insulation and improve air quality. These trends reflect a comprehensive approach to sustainability, ensuring that facilities are designed and constructed with a focus on environmental stewardship, energy efficiency, and the well-being of occupants.</p>
